AB With the widespread application of cloud computing sharing technology, the demand for cross-domain interaction is also increasing. However, due to the uncertainty of interaction behaviour and the difference of network service quality, the risk of cross-domain interaction cannot be accurately evaluated. Therefore, this paper proposes a risk situation evaluation model based on interdomain interactions. The model collects interactive credentials such as the frequency, credibility, and time-effectiveness of the user-submitted evaluations. At the same time, it collects the evaluation of quality of service provided by the network security domain. Then, we set up a risk evaluation equation based on the interaction credentials to implement the risk evaluation of cross-domain interaction behaviour. Finally, we apply MATLAB platform to simulate the evolution process of evaluation. The experimental results show that, compared with other models, the evaluation method proposed in this paper improves the accuracy of the evaluation results and meets the security requirements of multidomain interaction.
