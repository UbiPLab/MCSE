AB The next generation of fifth generation (5G) network, which is implemented using Virtualized Multi-access Edge Computing (vMEC), Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking (SDN) technologies, is a flexible and resilient network that supports various Internet of Things (IoT) devices. While NFV provides flexibility by allowing network functions to be dynamically deployed and inter-connected, vMEC provides intelligence at the edge of the mobile network reduces latency and increases the available capacity. With the diverse development of networking applications, the proposed vMEC use of Container-based Virtualization Technology (CVT) as gateway with IoT devices for flow control mechanism in scheduling and analysis methods will effectively increase the application Quality of Service (QoS). In this work, the proposed IoT gateway is analyzed. The combined effect of simultaneously deploying Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) and vMEC applications on a single network infrastructure, and critically in effecting exhibits low latency, high bandwidth and agility that will be able to connect large scale of devices. The proposed platform efficiently exploiting resources from edge computing and cloud computing, and takes IoT applications that adapt to network conditions to degrade an average 30% of end to end network latency.
