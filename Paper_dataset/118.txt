AB Recent developments in information technology can be attributed to the development of smart cities which act as a key enabler for next-generation intelligent systems to improve security, reliability, and efficiency. The healthcare sector becomes advantageous and offers different ways to manage patient information in order to improve healthcare service quality. The futuristic sustainable computing solutions in e-healthcare applications depend upon Internet of Things (IoT) in cloud computing environment. The energy consumed during data communication from IoT devices to cloud server is significantly high and it needs to be reduced with the help of clustering techniques. The current research article presents a new Oppositional Glowworm Swarm Optimization (OGSO) algorithm based clustering with Deep Neural Network (DNN) called OGSO-DNN model for distributed healthcare systems. The OGSO algorithm was applied in this study to select the Cluster Heads (CHs) from the available IoT devices. The selected CHs transmit the data to cloud server, which then executes DNN-based classification process for healthcare diagnosis. An extensive simulation analysis was carried out utilizing a student perspective healthcare data generated from UCI repository and IoT devices to forecast the severity level of the disease among students. The proposed OGSO-DNN model outperformed previous methods by attaining the maximum average sensitivity of 96.956%, specificity of 95.076%, the accuracy of 95.764% and F-score value of 96.888%.
