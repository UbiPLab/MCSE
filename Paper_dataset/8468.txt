AB Trustful Internet of Things (IoT) plays an important role in smart cities. The trust information in surveillance data motivates the analysis of images from numerous IoT devices. Saliency detection is a fundamental step in surveillance data analysis for providing help to the subsequent tasks, but unsuitable to IoT applications owing to the neglect of image similarity and difference from diverse IoT devices. To solve this problem, we enable the co-saliency detection in IoT, which detects the common and salient foreground regions in the group surveillance images. The main contributions include: 1) enable a multistage context perception scheme to efficiently extract the contextual information corresponding to different-size receptive fields in the single image; 2) construct a two-path information propagation to extract the interimage similarity and difference from the high-level image feature representations of the group images; and 3) propose the stage-wise refinement to allocate the label information to different parts of the network for helping the network to learn the enriched semantically common knowledge. The extensive experiments performed on three public data sets can demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and its superiority to four state-of-the-art co-saliency detection methods.
