AB In order to speed up the information construction process of data collection and analysis for smart campus, this paper aiming at the problems existing in the smart campus planning and current research. The acquisition network of underlying data is designed using 6LoWPAN wireless sensor technology which based on IPv6 technology and has the advantages of low power consumption, short distance and low requirement of hardware resources. At the same time, the embedded gateway is designed to interconnection of 6LoWPAN network and Ethernet based on 6-4 tunnel technology and the Netfilter framework. In addition, the sharing platform of data resource is designed using the C/S architecture, and realization the data acquisition system for smart campus based on 6LoWPAN wireless sensor technology. Again, the acquisition of variety data and equipment management is achieved by designing of data acquisition rules, data acquisition drive, data acquisition equipment online management. Finally, the problem of data storage and management of the smart campus data acquisition system is solved by using the powerful storage and processing capabilities for date of Hadoop distributed system. At the same time, the safe, accurate service to date end is realized by data models encapsulate services. Therefore, smart campus is using the new generation of information technology such as internet of things, cloud computing and big data to perceive, store, manage and analyse all the key information of campus system, and serves the teachers and students in the campus.
