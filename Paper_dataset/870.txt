AB The emergence of new classes of HPC applications and usage models, such as real-time HPC and cloud HPC, coupled with the increasingly heterogeneous nature of HPC architectures, requires a renewed investigation of memory management solutions. Traditionally, memory is shared by an operating system using segmentation and paging techniques. At the same time, new classes of applications require Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. As such, the typical practice of reserving a subset of the supercomputer to a single application becomes less attractive, leading to the exploration of cloud technologies. In this context, a viable scenario is that of multiple applications, with different QoS levels, coexisting on the same deeply heterogeneous HPC infrastructure and sharing resources. However, for this scenario to succeed in practice, resources, including memory, need to be allocated with a vision that includes both the application requirements and the current and future state of the overall system. In this survey, challenges of memory management in HPC and Cloud Computing, different memory management systems and optimisation techniques to increase memory utilisation are discussed in detail.
