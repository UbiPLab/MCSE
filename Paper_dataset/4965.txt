AB Cloud computing is the energetic distribution of information technology resources and proficiencies as a service above the Internet. Virtualization is the establishment of a virtual arrangement of system such as system computing device or machine server, a computer operating system, or network system device or hard disk storage device. To address the main problem of high load consumed in cloud system the efficient algorithm should be present and used. To make available scalability and eradicate the points of let-down, it is compulsory to prepare self-motivated Virtual Machine (VM) consolidation algorithms in a distributed manner. Therefore, a unique procedure is compulsory to create the dynamic VM consolidation distributed system. The scheduling objectives are to improve the system's time conflicts and time utilization for real-time tasks and save energy. An effective green control algorithm is developed which lead to significant task scheduling and reduced energy consumption. The experimental performed using CloudSim simulator indicates the scalability and performance of system in cloud computing. Our proposed technique can also improve the system performance of cloud computing in actual time cloud based environment.
