AB To support the large and various applications generated by the Internet of Things (IoT), Fog Computing was introduced to complement the Cloud Computing and offer Cloud-like services at the edge of the network with low latency and real-time responses. Large-scale, geographical distribution, and heterogeneity of edge computational nodes make service placement in such infrastructure a challenging issue. Diversity of user expectations and IoT devices characteristics also complicate the deployment problem. This article presents a survey of current research conducted on Service Placement Problem (SPP) in the Fog/Edge Computing. Based on a new classification scheme, a categorization of current proposals is given and identified issues and challenges are discussed.
