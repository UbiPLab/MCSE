AB Considering the openness and cross-domains of cloud computing, the traditional privacy-preserving technology cannot be applied in cloud computing efficiently. In this paper, inspired by the accountability idea, we proposed an accountable privacy-preserving mechanism based on identity-based encryption for cloud computing, which focuses on constraining the illegal network behavior by performing accountability to protect the privacy for cloud participants. First, based on the description logic, we defined the basic privacy concepts about the privacy guarantee, privacy request, privacy attribute, and privacy exposure condition for cloud system, and at the same time, the system architecture for the proposed accountable privacy-preserving mechanism is presented; second, combining the proposed accounting and auditing approaches, the integrated accountable privacy-preserving mechanism for cloud computing is proposed; and then, based on the possible two kinds adversary attacks against the proposed mechanism, the detailed security analysis and proof for the proposed mechanism are given; finally, we provide extensive experimental results and potential accountability implementation to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed mechanism.
