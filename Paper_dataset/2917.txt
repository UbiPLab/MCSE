AB Currently, information technology is developing rapidly, and resulting in the vigorous development of the IPv6. The new concept of the future network is applied to the smart objects which have sensing, networking and computing abilities, and the ability to transfer data between the objects; the novel network environment is called the Internet of Things (IoT). There are a large number of heterogeneous smart objects in the IoT; thus, the data are huge and complex. The conventional middleware layer in the IoT may result in huge amount of inaccurate information. Thus, a framework of middleware is proposed to filter and integrate the vast amounts of information to be meaningful and available. In addition, a three-phase scheduling under a cloud computational resource layer is proposed in this study to improve the effectiveness of the system. Thereby, each task to be performed can be assigned to the appropriate resources, while improving the load on each service node and reducing the waste of resources.
