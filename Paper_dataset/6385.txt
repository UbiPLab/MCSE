AB Cloud databases provide facilities for large scale data storage and retrieval of distributed data. However, the current access control techniques provided in database systems for maintaining security are not sufficient to secure the private data stored in public cloud databases. In this paper, a new secured data storage algorithm for effective maintenance of confidential data is proposed. To perform storage and retrieval operations of data in the cloud data storage effectively, map reduce algorithms are developed in this work which performs data reduction and fast processing. In order to consider the temporal nature of documents to be retrieved, we propose a new algorithm called Temporal Secured Cloud Map Reduced Algorithm which integrates temporal constraints with map reduce algorithms and also the chaining Hill Cipher encryption algorithms which is proposed newly in this work. The main advantages of the proposed algorithm is that they reduce the processing time and maintains security effectively. The experimental results obtained from this work depict that the proposed model is optimizing cost and it ensures data security.
