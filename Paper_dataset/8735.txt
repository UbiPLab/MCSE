AB With the progress of society, traditional online learning platforms have demonstrated the uneven distribution of information resources, and teacher-student communication exhibits a certain delay. At present, cloud computing, which is a new product of information technology, has been favored in many areas because of its superior feedback mechanism and storage space. Therefore, to improve the integration of online learning information resources and facilitate interaction between teachers and students, we designed our own online learning system based on the Google cloud computing platform. We used Google's cloud computing platform and the Google App Engine to develop a unified and open online learning platform that is capable of storing large amounts of data, integrating considerable amounts of learning resources, and storing them on cloud. Through a test, we determined that the designed online learning platform for sharing information resources and integrating teacher-student exchanges is highly beneficial. The platform helps the classroom learning atmosphere become active, and has a positive effect on teaching methods. The proposed platform can promote further development of online learning.
