AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is the internetworking of terminal physical devices depends on application programming interfaces and sensors to be connected to the Internet for collecting and exchanging data. According to the characteristics of IoT, it can provide rich services for the terminal user. However, the centralized cloud computing-based storage architecture in IoT faces many challenges, such as data security, identity privacy, and high latency. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces an IoT network storage architecture based on mobile edge computing, which not only achieves low-latency message response and computation offloading of the terminal user but also preserves identity-privacy of the terminal user. Afterward, we presented a novel non-interactive pairing-free ID-based proxy re-signature scheme (ID-PRS), which is a kernel technique to construct the aforementioned storage architecture. Compared with most of proxy re-signature schemes constructed based on traditional public-key-infrastructure, the proposed scheme avoids expensive pairing operation and intricate certificate-maintenance. And it is demonstrated to be provably secure under the classic security assumptions: integer factoring problem and the RSA assumption. Finally, in contrast to the other two ID-PRS schemes, the proposed ID-PRS scheme has more advantages in terms of security, functionability, and computation costs. Thus, it is very suitable to be applied to the resource-constrained mobile users.
