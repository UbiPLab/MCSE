AB Task scheduling is a challenging and important issue, which considering increases in data sizes and large volumes of data, has turned into an NP-hard problem. This has attracted the attention of many researchers throughout the world since cloud environments are in fact homogenous systems for maintaining and processing practical applications needed by users. Thus, task scheduling has become extremely important in order to provide better services to users. In this regard, the present study aims at providing a new task-scheduling algorithm using both firefly and simulated annealing algorithms. This algorithm takes advantage of the merits of both firefly and simulated annealing algorithms. Moreover, efforts have been made in regards to changing the primary population or primary solutions for the firefly algorithm. The presented algorithm uses a better primary solution. Local search was another aspect considered for the new algorithm. The presented algorithm was compared and evaluated against common algorithms. As indicated by the results, compared to other algorithms, the presented method performs effectively better in reducing to make span using different number of tasks and virtual machines.
