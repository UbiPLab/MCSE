AB Internet expansion affects currently diverse entities on the physical world and daily life. The democratization of the technology called Internet of Things (IoT) brings back many problems associated with the security of the transmitted data, autonomy, and ease of use, with the central constraint of gathering momentum. The use of an embedded development platform for IoT operating through Wi-Fi and cloud technology is in our case the solution that fits the internet model objects for wearable health care application. This work involves the study and implementation of wearable IoT secure solution dedicated to health care devoted to old and dependent people. The proposed hardware, powered by solar cells, operate through smart sleep and wake up events. The relevant part of the developed IoT operating software exploits the multiagent behavior. Case study, based on the exploitation of the Electric Imp platform, is proposed.
