AB Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is used for achieving data confidentiality and access control in cloud environments. Most often ABE schemes are constructed using bilinear pairing which has a higher computational complexity, making algorithms inefficient to some extent. The motivation of this paper is on achieving user privacy during the interaction with attribute authorities by improving the efficiency of ABE schemes in terms of computational complexity. As a result the aim of this paper is two-fold; firstly, to propose an efficient Tate pairing algorithm based on multi-base number representation system using point halving (TP-MBNR-PH) with bases 1/2, 3, and 5 to reduce the cost of bilinear pairing operations and, secondly, the TP-MBNR-PH algorithm is applied in decentralized KP-ABE to compare its computational costs for encryption and decryption with existing schemes.
