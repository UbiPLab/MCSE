AB Objective: To report a case of gas gangrene in a fetus at term, which was diagnosed by antenatal computed tomography (CT) imaging.
   Case Report: A 23-year-old primiparous woman, who did not undergo any prenatal health checks until term, developed hypertension, proteinuria, and clouding of consciousness, and experienced intrauterine fetal death. A single, mature fetus with voluminous gas bubbles was observed on CT, which was consistent with a diagnosis of fetal gas gangrene. Following the induction of labor, a dead, malodorous infant was delivered, along with foul-smelling and frothy amniotic fluid. The patient's condition deteriorated, and intensive care support was required to treat the patient for septic shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation during the postpartum period. She died on the 2nd postpartum day.
   Conclusion: Fetal gas gangrene is a very rare and potentially lethal event in pregnant women. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the antenatal diagnosis of fetal gas gangrene in a term pregnancy through CT. CT was useful for evaluating the extent of emphysematous change in the fetal and maternal organs. Copyright 2016, Taiwan Association of Obstetrics & Gynecology. Published by Elsevier Taiwan LLC.
