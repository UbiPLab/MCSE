AB Multiple Cloud storage has become one of the essential services of cloud computing. This Multi-Cloud storage models allow users to store sliced encrypted data in various cloud drives. Thus, it provides support for various cloud storage services using the single interface rather than using single cloud storage services. Cloud security goal primarily focuses on issues that relate to information privacy and security aspects of cloud computing. This latest data storage service and data moderation prototype focus on malicious insider's access on stored data, protection from malicious files, removal of centralized distribution of data storage and removal of outdated files or downloaded files frequently. Data owner does not necessarily need to worry about the future of the data stored in the MultiCloud server may be extracted or depraved. The other is ingress control of data. The proposed method ensures the file or data cannot get access without the knowledge or permission of the owner. Thus, this research aims at offering an architecture which reduces malicious insiders and file threats with an algorithm that improves data sharing security in Multi-Cloud storage services. This technique will offer a secure environment whereby the data owner can store and retrieve data from Multi-Cloud Environment without file merging conflicts and prevents insider attacks to obtain meaningful information. The experimental results indicate that the suggested model is suitable for decision making process for the data owners in the better adoption of multi-cloud storage service for sharing their information securely.
