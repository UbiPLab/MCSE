AB Lidar data are regularly used to characterize forest structures. In this study, we determine the effects of three lidar attributes (density, spacing, scanning angle) on the accuracy and the uncertainty of timber merchantable volume estimates of balsam fir stands (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) in eastern Canada. We used lidar point clouds to compute predictor variables of the merchantable volume in a nonlinear model. The best model included the mean height of first returns, the proportion of first returns below 2 m and the canopy surface roughness index. Our analysis shows a high correlation between lidar and field data of 119 plots (pseudo-R-2 = 0.91), however, residuals were heteroscedastic. More precise parameter estimates were obtained by adding to the model a variance function of variables describing the mean height of returns and the skewness of the area distribution of triangulated lidar returns. The residual standard deviation was better estimated (3.7 m(3) ha(-1) multiplied by the variance function versus 28.0 m(3) ha(-1)). We found no effect of density on the predictions (p-value = 0.74). This suggests that the height and the spatial pattern of returns, rather than the density, should be considered to better assess the uncertainty of merchantable volume estimates.
