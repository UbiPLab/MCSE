ID DATA-STORAGE
AB Integrating parallel computing and distributed computing together can be obtained by cloud computing (CC). One of the major problems faced by public CC is security regarding data access control. CC permits people to share data, documents, videos, and other types of data. Generally, the cloud data are considered as big data, because the volume of the data is huge and it has a greater number of varieties. In recent days, attribute-based data sharing applied only for selected data is a crucial problem. One of the existing approaches encrypts data using various kinds of keys based on several types of cryptosystems. However, those kinds of methods have some weaknesses such as inability to handle the attributes effectively, storage of more unwanted copies of the same data, and policy changes. It needs a high amount of computational cost and reduces the efficiency of memory utilization and the computational speed. This paper motivated to design and implement an efficient approach for optimized access control (OAC) for data stored in the cloud to overcome these kinds of issues. The efficiency of the proposed method is proved through a simulation-based experiment in Cloud Simulator.
