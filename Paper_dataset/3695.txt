AB The most recent incarnation of distributed paradigm is cloud computing. It can be seen as the first widely accepted business model of mass consumption of the distributed computing resources. Despite the differences in business models and technical details regarding cloud platforms, the distributed computing underlies cloud. Communications in cloud systems include transmissions of the results of cloud applications, users interactions, and exchange of data between different services that compose applications. The latter becomes more critical as applications become richer as well as more complex, and may consist of services operated by various providers. The effective communication between components of cloud systems is thus critical to the end user satisfaction and to the success of cloud services. We will discuss different cloud computing models (communication aware and unaware). Main focus will be placed on communication-aware directed acyclic graph (CA-DAG), which extends the classical DAG model by explicitly modeling communication tasks. Moreover, we will analyze and consult computational complexity of this innovative distributed computation model inspired by the characteristics of cloud computing. Providing a proof of strong NP-hardness of the problem allows for a future implementation and evolution of the communication-aware DAG models.
