AB This paper will present the authors' own techniques of secret data management and protection, with particular attention paid to techniques securing data services. Among the solutions discussed, there will be information-sharing protocols dedicated to the tasks of secret (confidential) data sharing. Such solutions will be presented in an algorithmic form, aimed at solving the tasks of protecting and securing data against unauthorized acquisition. Data-sharing protocols will execute the tasks of securing a special type of information, i.e., data services. The area of data protection will be defined for various levels, within which will be executed the tasks of data management and protection. The authors' solution concerning securing data with the use of cryptographic threshold techniques used to split the secret among a specified group of secret trustees, simultaneously enhanced by the application of linguistic methods of description of the shared secret, forms a new class of protocols, i.e., intelligent linguistic threshold schemes. The solutions presented in this paper referring to the service management and securing will be dedicated to various levels of data management. These levels could be differentiated both in the structure of a given entity and in its environment. There is a special example thereof, i.e., the cloud management processes. These will also be subject to the assessment of feasibility of application of the discussed protocols in these areas. Presented solutions will be based on the application of an innovative approach, in which we can use a special formal graph for the creation of a secret representation, which can then be divided and transmitted over a distributed network.
