AB This study investigates the status of services, issues and needs related to infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) for organisational consumers in Thailand. The important advantage of this study is that it provides useful information to providers for developing guidelines to promote the readiness of IaaS provision in Thailand to meet consumers' needs. Furthermore, related organisations can use the study results to foster cloud IaaS in the country based on the problems and needs of providers.
   We conducted a survey using the statistical methodology of mixed sampling with stratified random sampling and purposive sampling based on government and private sectors including various types of businesses, as well as a set of questionnaires as a tool to collect data for analysis. In addition, we studied existing research and scholarly work to create a clear survey procedure. Based on the survey results, we find that the majority of organisational consumers already use domestic IaaS to reduce costs and also use overseas IaaS to increase data availability. The most popular form of IaaS consumption is virtual data storage. Some major consumer concerns are the lack of confidence in service security, quality and standards, and their main demands are security regulations on the provider's side and improved service level agreement standards.
