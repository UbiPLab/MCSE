AB Biomass burning causes a non-permanent land cover change (burned area) through the removal of vegetation, the deposition of charcoal and ashes, and the exposure of soil; the temporal persistence of these changes is highly variable, ranging from a few weeks in savannas to years in forests. Algorithms for the generation of moderate-resolution (10-30 m) continental and global burned area maps have been prototyped in an effort to meet the needs of diverse users of fire information. Nevertheless, moderate-resolution sensors have reduced the temporal resolution (e.g., to 16 days for Landsat), which could potentially lead to omission errors, especially in ecosystems where the spectral signal associated with burning disappears quickly and cloud cover limits the number of valid observations. This study presents a global analysis of the burned area persistence time, defined as the duration of the spectral separability of the burned/unburned areas mapped by the MODIS MCD64 Global Burned Area Product. The separability was computed by analyzing time series of normalized burn ratio (NBR) from nadir BRDF-adjusted MODIS reflectances (MCD43 product). Results showed that, globally, the median burned area persistence time was estimated at 29 days, and 86.6% of the global area, as detected by MODIS, can only be detected accurately for up to 48 days. Thus, results indicate that burned area persistence time can be a limiting factor for global burned area mapping from moderate-resolution satellite sensors, which have a low temporal resolution (e.g., Landsat 16 days, Sentinel-2A/B 5 days).
