AB Taking advantage of the data gathering capability of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) as well as the data storage and processing ability of mobile cloud computing (MCC), WSN-MCC integration is attracting significant attention from both academia and industry. This paper focuses on processing of the sensory data in WSN-MCC integration, by identifying the critical issues concerning WSN-MCC integration and proposing a novel sensory data processing framework, which aims at transmitting desirable sensory data to the mobile users in a fast, reliable, and secure manner. The proposed framework could prolong the WSN lifetime, decrease the storage requirements of the sensors and the WSN gateway, and reduce the traffic load and bandwidth requirement of sensory data transmissions. In addition, the framework is capable of monitoring and predicting the future trend of the sensory data traffic, as well as improving its security. The framework further decreases the storage and processing overhead of the cloud, while enabling mobile users to securely obtain their desired sensory data faster. Analytical and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
