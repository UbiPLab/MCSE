AB While large layer-2 networks are widely accepted as the network fabric for modern data centers and network virtualization is required to support multi-tenant cloud computing, existing network virtualization solutions are not specifically designed for layer-2 networks. In this paper, we design SVDC, a highly-scalable and low-overhead virtualization architecture for large layer-2 data center networks. By leveraging the emerging software defined networking (SDN) framework, SVDC decouples the global identifier of a virtual network from the identifier carried in the packet header. Hence, SVDC can scale to a great number of virtual networks with a very short tag in the packet header, which is never achieved by previous network virtualization solutions. SVDC enhances MAC-in-MAC encapsulation in a way that packets with overlapped MAC addresses are correctly forwarded even without in-packet global identifiers to differentiate the virtual networks they belong to. Besides, scalable and efficient layer-2 multicast and broadcast within virtual networks are also supported in SVDC. With extensive simulations and experiments, we show that SVDC is better than existing solutions in many aspects, particularly isolating virtual networks with high scalability and higher network goodput due to minimal packet header overhead.
