AB With the diversity of the communication technology and the heterogeneity of the computation resources at network edge, both the edge cloud and peer devices (collaborators) can be scavenged to provide computation resources for the resource-limited Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. In this paper, a novel cooperative computing paradigm is proposed, in which the computation resources of IoT device, opportunistically idle collaborators and dedicated edge cloud are fully exploited. Computation/offloading assistance is provided by collaborators at idle/busy states, respectively. Considering the channel randomness and opportunistic computation resource share of collaborators, we study the stochastic offloading control for an IoT device, regarding how much computation load is processed locally, offloaded to the edge cloud and a collaborator. The problem is formulated into a finite horizon Markov decision problem with the objective of minimizing the expected total energy consumption of the IoT device and the collaborator, subject to satisfying the hard computation deadline constraint. Optimal offloading policy is derived based on the stochastic optimization theory, which demonstrates that the energy consumption can be reduced by a proportional factor through the cooperative computing. More energy saving is achieved with better wireless channel condition or higher computation energy efficiency of collaborators. Simulation results validate the optimality of the proposed policy and the efficiency of the cooperative computing between end devices and edge cloud, compared to several other offloading schemes.
