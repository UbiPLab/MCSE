AB Caching content with fog computing at the edge nodes has been a promising alternative to mitigate burdens of backbone networks and improve mobile users' quality of experience in mobile social networks (MSNs). However, as edge node may be vulnerable due to the attacks from malicious users, the design of secure caching schemes for the fog/edge enabled MSNs becomes a new challenge. In this paper, to tackle the above problem, we propose a secure caching scheme for disaster backup in MSNs with fog computing. Specifically, to protect the privacy, a partitioning and scrambling method is first designed to encrypt the contents. Then, the encrypted contents are replicated to multiple replicates, where these replicates are delivered and stored in different servers. Based on the recovery time objective and content delivery latency, an auction game model is developed to determine the optimal servers, where both edge nodes and cloud servers can obtain the maximum utilities. Extensive simulations are conducted to show the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed scheme.
