AB The metabolic disease Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM1) is caused by a reduction in the production of pancreatic insulin, which causes chronic hyperglycemia. Patients with DM1 are required to perform multiple blood glucose measurements on a daily basis to monitor their blood glucose dynamics through the use of capillary glucometers. In more recent times, technological developments have led to the development of cutting-edge biosensors and Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) systems that can monitor patients' blood glucose levels on a real-time basis. This offers medical providers access to glucose oscillations modeling interventions that can enhance DM1 treatment and management approaches through the use of novel disruptive technologies, such as Cloud Computing (CC), big data, Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA) and the Internet of Things (IoT). This work applies some advanced modeling techniques to a complete data set of glycemia-related biomedical features-obtained through an extensive, passive monitoring campaign undertaken with 25 DM1 patients under real-world conditions-in order to model glucose level dynamics through the proper identification of patterns. Hereby, four methods, which are run through CC due to the high volume of data collected, are applied and compared within an IoT context. The results show that Bayesian Regularized Neural Networks (BRNN) offer the best performance (0.83 R-2) with a reduced Root Median Squared Error (RMSE) of 14.03 mg/dL.
