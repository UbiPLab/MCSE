AB This paper conducts the feasibility study for discussing about the interference impacts in advanced fog computing (FC) networks with 60 GHz millimeter-wave wireless technology. With the concept of FC, cloud computing services can be utilized with local computing devices (FC devices) those are located nearby user terminals [edge devices (EDs)] for low-latency communications. Since EDs can be densely deployed in urban areas, wireless hyperconnection should be supportable in FC networks. For the system, 60 GHz millimeter-wave technology can be used as one of wireless networking methods because it can provide: 1) high rates for visual information delivery and 2) high directionality for spatial reuse in hyperconnected FC networks. Therefore, this performance simulation study under the consideration of interference impacts determines whether utilizing 60 GHz millimeter-wave wireless technology for hyperconnected FC networks is feasible or not. Under the consideration of various interference scenarios, the interference impacts are calculated. As presented in simulation-based performance evaluation results, we verify that 1.5 Gb/s high rate can be supportable even though more than 1000 EDs are deployed in the 100 m-by-100 m size small-scale networks (upper bound). Therefore, we confirm that hyperconnection can be realized with 60 GHz millimeter-wave technology for FC networks.
