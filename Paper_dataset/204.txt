AB Security issues in cloud computing have become a hot topic in academia and industry, and CP-ABE is an effective solution for managing and protecting data. When data is shared in cloud computing, they usually have multiple access structures that have hierarchical relationships. However, existing CP-ABE algorithms do not consider such relationships and just require data owners to generate multiple ciphertexts to meet the hierarchical access requirement, which would incur substantial computation overheads. To achieve fine-grained access control of multiple hierarchical files effectively, first we propose an efficient hierarchical CP-ABE algorithm whose access structure is linear secret sharing scheme. Moreover, we construct an attribute-based hierarchical access control scheme, namely AHAC. In our scheme, when a data visitor's attributes match a part of the access control structure, he can decrypt the data that associate with this part. The experiments show that AHAC has good security and high performance. Furthermore, when the quantity of encrypted data files increases, the superiority of AHAC will be more significant.
