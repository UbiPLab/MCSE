AB Live Migration is one of the essential operations that require more attention to addressing its high variability problems with virtual machines. We review the existing techniques of resource management to find that there are less modeling to solve this problem. The present paper introduces a novel framework that mainly targets to achieve a computational effective resource management technique. The technique uses the stochastic approach in modelling to design a new traffic management scheme that considers multiple traffic possibilities over VMs along with its switching states. Supported by an analytical modelling approach, the proposed technique offers an efficient placement of virtual machine to the physical server, performs the computation of blocks, and explores reduced resource usage. The study outcome was found to possess potential reduction in live migration, more extent of VM mapping with physical servers, and increased level of capacity.
