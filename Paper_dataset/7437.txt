AB Nowadays there is a global understanding for the importance of e-learning systems which has proved its applicability and advancement through the years especially in higher education sector. According to this increase in its importance, many educational organizations have applied e-learning process with focusing on the benefits to the student in applying this learning system. However, this increase has led to the requirements of applying a scalable, reliable, and high performance e-learning system to ensure the student's satisfaction and raising the students' education level which is the main aim of the educational process. Consequently, the role of new information technology directions is increasing for the success of the e-learning process. In this paper, we propose an adaptive educational process for e-learning systems based on applying e-learning on cloud computing environment with the support of a load balancing technique to ensure the highest available performance in the educational process and the positive impact for the student's user satisfaction. The proposed approach has been evaluated and the results have been demonstrated in this paper.
