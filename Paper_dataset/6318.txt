AB The advent of cloud computing (CC) in recent years has attracted substantial interest from various institutions, especially higher education institutions, which wish to consider the advantages of its features. Many universities have migrated from traditional forms of teaching to electronic learning services, and they rely upon information and communication technology services. The usage of CC in educational environments provides many benefits, such as low-cost services for academics and students. The expanded use of CC comes with significant adoption challenges. Understanding the position of higher education institutions with respect to CC adoption is an essential research area. This paper investigated the current state of CC adoption in the higher education sector in order to enrich the research in this area of interest. Existing limitations and knowledge gaps in current empirical studies are identified. Moreover, suggested areas for further researches will be highlighted for the benefit of other researchers who are interesting in this topic. These researches encourage institutions of education especially in higher education to adopted cloud computing technology.
