AB The process of selecting which virtual machines (VMs) should be executed at each physical machine (PM) of a virtualized infrastructure is commonly known as Virtual Machine Placement (VMP). This work presents a general many-objective optimization framework that is able to consider as many objective functions as needed when solving a VMP problem in a pure multi-objective context. As an example of utilization of the proposed framework, a formulation of a many-objective VMP problem (MaVMP) is proposed, considering the simultaneous optimization of the following five objective functions: (1) power consumption, (2) network traffic, (3) economical revenue, (4) quality of service and (5) network load balancing. To solve the formulated MaVMP problem, an interactive memetic algorithm is proposed. Experimental results prove the correctness of the proposed algorithm, its effectiveness converging to a manageable number of solutions and its capabilities to solve problem instances with large numbers of PMs and VMs.
