AB The research objectives were: 1) to develop cyber resilient model, 2) to develop the cyber resilient capability maturity model and 3) to develop self-assessment model for cyber resilient capability of cloud computing services which are qualitative and applicative research. Referring to the cybersecurity concept from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) from the in-depth interview, focus-group discussion was developed with cybersecurity experts and data collection from cloud services providers. It was found that trend of cyber-attacks was violent with smarter method. The authors had synthesized the concept of cyber resilient capability maturity model for cloud computing services including developed application for cloud services providers to evaluate their organization in order to improve the better cybersecurity level in cloud computing services and the cyber resilient capability maturity model in the future.
