AB The Industrial Internet of Things is cited as the latest means for making manufacturing more flexible, cost effective, and responsive to changes in customer demands. In this paper, we present a mobile cloud based scheduling strategy for the industrial Internet of Things. Several computing paradigms, such as mobile cloud computing, fog computing, and edge computing can be integrated to the industrial Internet of Things, which allow to offload tasks to the cloud for execution. We model the task scheduling problem as an energy consumption optimization problem, while taking into account task dependency, data transmission, and some constraint conditions, such as response time deadline and cost, and further solve it by genetic algorithms. A series of simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the algorithm and the results have shown that our proposal is more efficient than the baseline approach.
