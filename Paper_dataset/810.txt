AB We present a privacy-preserving framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled composition for the edge networks. Edge computing is a very promising technology for provisioning realtime AI services due to low response time and network bandwidth requirements. Due to the lack of computational capabilities, an edge device alone cannot provide the complex AI services. Complex AI tasks should be divided into multiple sub-tasks and distributed among multiple edge devices for efficient service provisioning in the edge network. AI-enabled or automatic service composition is one of the essential AI tasks in the service provisioning. In edge computing-based service provisioning, service composition related tasks need to be offloaded to several edge nodes for efficient service. Edge nodes can be used for monitoring services, storing Quality-of-Service (QoS) data, and composing services to find the best composite service. Existing service composition methods use plaintext QoS data. Hence, attackers may compromise edge devices to reveal QoS data of services and modify them for giving an advantage to particular edge service providers, and the AI-based service composition becomes biased. From that point of view, a privacy-preserving framework for AI-based service composition is required for the edge networks. In our proposed framework, we introduce an AI-based composition model for edge services in the edge networks. Additionally, we present a privacy-preserving AI service composition framework to perform composition on encrypted QoS data using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) algorithm. We conduct several experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed privacy-preserving service composition framework using a synthetic QoS dataset.
