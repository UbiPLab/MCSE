AB Over the past decades cloud computing playing promising role in IT environment, However high energy consumption in data centers will cause a major damages in cloud. Creating dynamic virtual machine providing excellent solution to this issue. Integrating VM is a technique to handle Physical machine to control its mode operations where overloaded condition. At the same energy aware incite poor QoS sometimes. This letter, we presenting Optimal Ant Colony for allocating heterogeneous virtual machine in cloud. Main design of this system improves the high throughput and less latency time for accessing a data from a cloud environment. OAC for DVM (Dynamic Virtual Machine), allocating multiple VM (Virtual Machine) to a PM (Physical Machine). PM controls by Local Agent (LA). It can be allocate and change the resources from VM to VM and Global Agent (GA) for PM to PM based on Server Overloading Condition (P-Normal, P-Overload, P-Under) also extendable with Temporary memory sharing process for resource. The result analysis show that our work is more efficient to compare previous work.
