AB One of the key problems for Infrastructure-as-a-Service providers is finding the optimal allocation of virtual machines on the physical machines available in the provider's data center. Since the allocation has significant impact on operational costs as well as on the performance of the accommodated applications, several algorithms have been proposed for the virtual machine placement problem. Sofar, no objective comparison of the proposed algorithms has been provided; therefore, it is not known which one works best or what factors influence the performance of the algorithms. In this paper, we present an environment and methodology for such comparisons and compare 7 different algorithms using the proposed environment and methodology. Our results showcase differences of up to 66% between the effectiveness of different algorithms on the same real-world workload traces, thus underlining the importance of objectively comparing the performance of competing algorithms.
