AB Vehicular networking involves the storage, compute, and analysis of massive vehicular data. Vehicular cloud computing, as a special cloud computing platform, seamlessly combines vehicular ad hoc networks and conventional cloud computing. However, in the vehicular cloud computing, there is still the problem of unauthorized users accessing and stealing data. In the traditional ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) scheme, a trusted central authority is employed to manage attributes and distribute keys. Based on multi-authority (MA) CP-ABE, we propose a secure and revocable access control scheme for vehicular cloud computing in this paper, in which the requester can decrypt the ciphertext with only a small amount of computation. We show that our MA-CP-ABE scheme can prevent static corruption of authorities in the standard model under the decisional q-parallel bilinear Diffie-Hellman exponent assumption. Theoretical analysis and experimental simulation results show that our scheme has lower communication cost and lower computational complexity than other schemes.
