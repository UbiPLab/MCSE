AB PHR System is a favorable platform for personal health information exchange. In order to ensure that the personal information is not falsified and leaked by malicious users, we use the attribute-based signcryption technology to provide secure and reliable data protection. At the same time, in order to prevent users from accessing the data in the system by collusion of attributes, we proposes a revocable cloud-assisted attribute-based signcryption scheme which using the broadcast encryption technology and key segmentation technology realize user revocation function. Moreover, the proposed scheme is proven to be confidentiality and unforgeability under chosen plaintext attack in the random oracle model. And the experimental evaluation indicates that the proposed scheme is practical and feasible.
