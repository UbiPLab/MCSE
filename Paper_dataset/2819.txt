AB Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) integrates various types of intelligent terminals, mobile devices, and communication technologies to enable the upgrade of traditional industries to intelligent industries. IIoT relies on the powerful data processing capabilities of cloud computing to reduce the cost of various on-demand services as per the requirements of users. However, the privacy and confidentiality of the outsourced data should be protected in this environment because the data are typically "handled" by a third-party service provider. An encryption technique can guarantee the confidentiality of the data but it limits data retrieval due to its innate "all-or-nothing" decryption feature. To apply encryption to privacy-preserving data retrieval, many public key encryption techniques with keyword search systems have been proposed in the literature. However, most of the existing schemes are vulnerable to inside keyword guessing attack (IKGA), which is caused by a small keyword space. To address this problem, we propose a certificateless public key authenticated encryption with keyword search scheme, which is provably secure against IKGA. A performance analysis of the proposed scheme demonstrates that it is more secure and effective compared with other certificateless public key encryption with keyword search schemes.
