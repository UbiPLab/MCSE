AB Technology such as cloud computing(CC) is constantly evolving and being adopted by the industries to manage their data and tasks. CC provides the resources for managing the tasks of the cloud users. The acceptance of the CC in healthcare industries is proven to be more cost-effective and convenient. CC manager has to manage the resources to provide services to the end-users of the healthcare sector. The SLAMMP framework discussed here shows how the resources are managed by using the concept of reinforcement learning (RL) and LSTM (long short-term memory) for monitoring and prediction of the cloud resources for healthcare organizations. The task(s) pattern and anti-pattern scenarios have been observed using HMM (hidden Markov model). These patterns will tune the SLA parameters (service level agreement) using blockchain-based smart contracts (SC). The result discussed here indicates that the variations in the cloud resource demand will be handled carefully using the SLAMMP framework. From the result obtained, it is identified that SLAMMP performs well with the parameter used here.
