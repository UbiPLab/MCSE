AB Software aging affects the availability of Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM), one of the main components of virtualized environments. Software aging causes internal software degradation due to bugs activation and accumulation during its execution. Software rejuvenation implemented through Virtual Machine (VM) Live Migration may be applied to cope with software aging effects on cloud computing system. Another relevant problem is the power consumption of using software rejuvenation techniques in the virtualized environments. This paper presents availability models based on Stochastic Petri Nets to evaluate two VM Live Migration approaches. These approaches are based on the redundancy schemes: Warm-Standby and Cold-Standby. In the Cold-Standby migration, the migration target machine is started only before the VM Live Migration. In the Warm-Standby Migration, the migration target machine runs along with the source migration machine. Results show that VM Live Migration causes a significant improvement in system availability. Scenarios with a heavy workload present an annual downtime reduction of 164 h. The availability comparison between two approaches reveals that the Cold-Standby approach has a slightly better result due to the decrease in the total number of VM Live Migrations. The power consumption results show that Cold-Standby approach is more efficient in power consumption. In all the observed scenarios, the costs savings by using Cold-Standby approach exceed 40%. The highlights of this paper are: i) a comprehensive model for availability evaluation of cloud computing with VMM rejuvenation through VM migration scheduling; ii) sensitivity analysis to define proper rejuvenation scheduling to maximize system availability and iii) power consumption comparison of the two adopted migration approaches.
