AB IoT (Internet-of-Things) applications tend to have strict service delay restrictions. Always connecting to the cloud to process data is inefficient for such applications. Edge-cloud computing is a new computing paradigm ready to back IoT applications. It shares the advantages of both edge computing and cloud computing. While service delay is key to QoE (Quality of Experience) of such service systems, power consumption is evenly crucial when it comes to operating costs in practice. Keeping down both service delay and power consumption is a challenging problem as they are negatively correlated via multiple factors. This paper focuses on the trade-off between service delay and power consumption of a typical hybrid edge-cloud system. We build the statistical mathematical service delay model as well as the power model and formulate an optimization problem which suggests optimal system configurations, task allocation destination and quantity. This optimization problem is solved using multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. Results show that the proposed system model is able to reflect characteristics of practical systems, and is worth testing in practice. Further decisions can be made by combining the Pareto optimal results with the diverse needs of each system or other additional subjective preferences to achieve ideal optimal system states respectively.
