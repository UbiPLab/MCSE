AB National Science and Technology Information Service (NTIS) is a comprehensive information system that collects and manages the information of the national R&D projects such as R&D projects and outputs, equipment and human resource for the efficient support of the national R&D planning, evaluation, management, and utilization. NTIS also provides a cloud service that supports the configuration of disaster recovery environment, the system expecting traffic congestion, the configuration of development and test environment, existing legacy system utilization, security enhancement, short-term server utilization, cost reduction, and the configuration of the high-availability infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a NTIS cloud service as the information analysis system with a consideration of the security of the national R&D information on the cloud computing environment. The purpose of the proposed NTIS cloud service is to provide the raw data of the national R&D information to the researchers who need a range of analysis for project planning, and research paper and patent publication planning. We aim to improve the productivity of the national R&D by providing the easy and convenient user interface and analysis environment.
