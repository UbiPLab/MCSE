AB This paper presents an idea of intelligent service management processes in the Cloud. The main aspects are application of threshold schemes for secure distributed service providing. Authors propose a new idea of secure service management using sharing techniques. Those technigues are dedicated to secure processes as well as secret spllitting and sharing, and seems to be very usefull for securing all data/service and all parts of them. The proposed idea of cognitive service management and data/information sharing in the Cloud, include the use of cognitive data analysis algorithms, cryptographic data splitting and sharing techniques, schemes for hiding information and cognitive management systems. The novelty of proposed solutions lays in considering the characteristic and main profiles of provided cloud services, as well as semantic meaning of distributed information, thanks to the application of cognitive information systems.
