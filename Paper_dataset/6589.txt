AB One of the most important issues which attract the researcher is to provide a secure channel to transfer data between many points. Television cloud has many contents which are needed to be transferred to authorized groups (AuthGs). Also, the transfer rate is an aspect to be considered. In this work, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing is investigated to be sure it is acceptable for the cloud and use many transforms to choose the perfect one for the cloud. The investigation is done under fading channel condition. Peak signal-to-noise ratio is used to differentiate between cases. Many tests are also suggested to confirm the high quality of performance for the cloud.
