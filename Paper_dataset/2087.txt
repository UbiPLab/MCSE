DE Cloud Computing; Kalman Filter; Resource Allocation
AB In recent decades lots of attention attracted toward Cloud Computing, and that's only because of services and powers which present by cloud providers. They present different kind of services, such as: processing ability, storage capacity, Platform as a Service, Software as a Service. According to experts and managers of different industry opinions, two main difficulties in front of organizations and companies in order to migrate to cloud computing is security and accessible resources. In this paper we want to introduce new allocation algorithm for cloud resources. This algorithm is smart algorithm, which is based on Kalman filtering and allocates resources and powers to the users based on their usage backgrounds and their present demand.
