AB Today, mobile phones have become smarter than ever before and people are always carrying them. Mobile phones are not only references for computing and communications, but also a great option for gathering information about individuals and their surroundings. This study investigates the problem of mapping air pollution by leveraging a crowd of people that are equipped with smartphones. The proposed system uses mobile cloud computing as well, in order to collect and aggregate air pollution data. At the layer of mobile devices, air pollution is measured by local portable sensors through the exposure of users to the surrounding environment. Afterwards, these pieces of local information generated by the crowd of users are aggregated in the cloud layer. The proposed system is implemented in two components for mobile device and cloud. Furthermore, the scenario-based approach is used to evaluate the functionality of the system.
