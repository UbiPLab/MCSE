AB In the process of using the cloud platform, how to ensure the safety of users is a matter we must concern. The user authentication can provide a certain degree of security, but when the user information was leaked, this method will not be effective. Therefore, this article proposes a trust evaluation model based on user behavior data. In this model, the user's historical behavior will be used to construct a set of trusted behavior of the cloud users. On this basis, the direct trust of the user's behavior can be obtained. Then, the recommendation trust can be calculated by the interaction between the users and other cloud users. Given the current historical trust, the comprehensive trust can be obtained using the weighted average method. Among them, the initial value of historical trust is set to a constant and then updated by the comprehensive trust. In order to control the user's abnormal behavior more effectively, the suspicious threshold value and the abnormal threshold value were defined, which are used to punish the historical trust. Through the simulation of the virtual digital library cloud platform, the method can effectively evaluate the cloud users.
