AB With the support of cloud computing, the scalability of the information-centric Internet of Things (IC-IoT) can be increased greatly. In the cloud-supported IC-IoT, how to make search more secure and efficient is a key issue to deal with. Searchable encryption is a potential technique to solve the above problem. In the cloud-supported IC-IoT, sensitive data are provided by multiple data users and can be accessed by specific data users. Then, the expression ability, search authorization, dynamic updates, and search efficiency become major concerns of search in the cloud-supported IC-IoT. In this paper, SASDQ, a semantic and authorized search scheme with dynamic updates and quick response, is proposed. In SASDQ, by constructing users' personal dictionaries, dynamic updates and efficient index generation are achieved, and by leveraging ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption and conceptual graphs, semantic search with file-level fine-grained access authorization can be realized. In addition, quick search response is implemented by the preprocessing of time-consuming authorization tasks. The analysis shows that the proposed scheme can meet the data security requirement of the cloud-supported IC-IoT, and it also has less cost compared with other popular models.
