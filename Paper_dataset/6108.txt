In recent years, Smart Homes have increased security and management challenges due to the low capacity of small sensors, multiple connectivity to the Internet for efficient applications (use of big data and cloud computing), and heterogeneity of home systems, which require inexpert users to configure devices and micro-systems. This article presents current security and management approaches in Smart Homes and shows the good practices imposed on the market for developing secure systems in houses. At last, we propose future solutions for efficiently and securely managing the Smart Homes.
