AB This study explores the determinants of Cloud BI adoption among Ghanaian small-medium enterprises (SMEs). The study was guided by the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework and information systems adoption model and employed the qualitative method through an in-depth interview with data collected from CEOs/key managers from 17 SMEs in Ghana. The results showed that technological characteristics (relative advantage, complexity, and compatibility), organizational characteristics (organization size and organizational readiness), environmental characteristics (competitive pressure and regulatory framework), and owner-manager characteristics (innovativeness and knowledge) influence the adoption of Cloud BI tools and services in Ghanaian SMEs. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by providing a Cloud BI adoption model from a developing country context. Practically, the study provides insights to vendors about the kind of Cloud BI Ghanaian SMEs require. Vendors can also use the findings to create awareness about the services they offer in terms of Cloud BI.
