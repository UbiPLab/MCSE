AB Attribute based encryption can provide data confidentiality protection and fine-grained access control for fog-cloud computing, however mobile devices in fog cloud computing system are difficult to bear the burdensome computing burden of attribute based encryption. In order to address this problem, an offline/online ciphertext-plicy attribute-based encryption scheme is presented with verifiable outsourced decryption based on the bilinear group of prime order. It can realize the offline/online key generation and data encryption. Simultaneously, it supports the verifiable outsourced decryption. Then, the formal security proofs of its selective chosen plaintext attack security and verifiability are provided. After that, the improved offline/online ciphertext-plicy attribute-based encryption scheme with verifiable outsourced decryption is presented, which reduces the number of bilinear pairings from linear to constant in the transformation phase. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed scheme is analyzed and verified through theoretical analysis and experimental simulation. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme is efficient and practical.
