AB In this article, the author discusses the network system structure design for data centers in large enterprises using cloud computing. First, she designs a framework for a cloud data center in large enterprise systems. Second, she establishes the data center network frame based on software-defined networking (SDN) and the algorithm procedure. Third, she studies the moving algorithm of a virtual machine and the broadband allocation mechanism of a data center of a large enterprise network system along with the mathematical model. Finally, the author carries out the performance simulation analysis of the data center based on cloud computing. Finally, she carries out the performance comparison between the new data center at a large enterprise network system and traditional systems. The author shows that the new data center model in large enterprise network systems has a better network capacity and fault tolerance.
