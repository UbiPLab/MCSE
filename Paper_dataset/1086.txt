AB Industry 4.0 is a key topic in the discussion about the future of Textile and Clothing (T&C) industry in Europe. This 4th Industrial Revolution is a vision, an important change of the current paradigm, able to make the convergence between real and digital world in the future "smart factory".

Technologies as barcode devices, RFID, sensors, Bluetooth, GPS or 3D simulators starts to be present in the textile and clothing industry.

In order to adapt the theories and models known from I4.0 to GUIMA's reality, as RFID in the fabrics and accessories to allow real-time updates of the stocks, all the planning is done with the IoS system, the cutting plans and production orders are assisted by a 3D system and the different batches are incorporated RFID tags. The ICT companies are critical partners in this partnership, but also the HEI, the scientific community and technological centres.
