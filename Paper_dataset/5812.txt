AB The effective utilization of virtual instances by suspend resume policy in virtualized data center is analyzed in this paper. Cloud computing is a term that describes the means of delivering all information technology from computing power to computing infrastructure, applications, business process and personal collaboration to end users as a service wherever and whenever they need it. Here Infrastructure as a Service is used for open source cloud implementation. Open Stack provides architecture for cloud to build the virtual instances. Thus Virtual Machine allocates a single job, by dividing them to the grid systems. Suspend resume policy is used to provide the jobs to the virtual instances based on the usage. It helps in examining the weight flanked by the virtual instances as job arrived.
