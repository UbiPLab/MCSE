AB Cloud computing is the highly demanded technology nowadays. Due to the service oriented architecture, seamless accessibility and other advantages of this advent technology, many transaction rich applications are making use of it. At the same time, it is vulnerable to hacks and threats. Hence securing this environment is of at most important and many research works are being reported focusing on it. This paper proposes a safe storage mechanism using Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) for the Transaction Rich Applications (TRA). With ECC based security scheme, the security level of the protected system will be increased and it is more suitable to secure the delivered data in the portable devices. The proposed scheme shields the aligning of different kind of data elements to each provider using an ECC algorithm. Analysis, comparison and simulation prove that the proposed system is more effective and secure for the Transaction rich applications in Cloud.
