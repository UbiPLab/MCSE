AB With the advancement in the science and technology, cloud computing has become a recent trend in environment with immense requirement of infrastructure and resources. Load balancing of cloud computing environments is an important matter of concern. The migration of the overloaded virtual machines (VMs) to the underloaded VM with optimized resource utilization is the effective way of the load balancing. In this paper, a new VM migration algorithm for the load balancing in the cloud is proposed. The migration algorithm proposed (EGSA-VMM) is based on exponential gravitational search algorithm which is the integration of gravitational search algorithm and exponential weighted moving average theory. In our approach, the migration is done based on the migration cost and QoS. The experimentation of proposed EGSA-based VM migration algorithm is compared with ACO and GSA. The simulation of experiments shows that the proposed EGSA-VMM algorithm achieves load balancing and reasonable resource utilization, which outperforms existing migration strategies in terms of number of VM migrations and number of SLA violations.
