AB The spread of cloud computing is accelerating universities to seek a better educational approach for capitalizing on its capabilities. With the practice of cloud computing in Saudi Arabia universities, instructors are yet unable to interact with the students face-to-face due to the gender separation practice. It becomes worse in a multilingual environment as the students are less fluent in the first language formally practiced in the university. With the current best practice, the students are able to utilize one app to translate the presentation slides and another app to translate the instructor's speech. The student prefers to comprehend the learning materials, although it delays the process of teaching. Therefore, there is a need to integrate current practices. A prototype of a smart class based on cloud computing is developed to ease the use of a mobile device. This project is evaluated by utilizing both direct and indirect assessment spanning across three academic semesters. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by IASE.
