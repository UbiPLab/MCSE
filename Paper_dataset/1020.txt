ID SCHEDULING ALGORITHM
AB Cloud computing is used for processing resources that are conveyed as an administration over a network and a prototype to enable beneficial on-interest network access to a general loch of configurable reckoning resources which are rapidly provisioned and discharged. While adopting cloud computing, major challenges like resource provisioning, resource allocation and security are arising. Only prevailing resource provisioning algorithm are depending upon single tier application utilizing meta-heuristic methodology. Here, we presented a multi-tier application for provisioning dynamic resources utilizing meta-heuristic methodology like Ant Colony Optimization algorithm (ACO), Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm and hybrid algorithm which fuses ACO and SA and also an improved cost based scheduling is used to schedule jobs within the cloud with reduced cost. Implementation outcomes displays the efficiency of provisioning resources using ACO-SA algorithm in multitier application of hybrid cloud is greater than other resource provisioning algorithms in cloud computing.
