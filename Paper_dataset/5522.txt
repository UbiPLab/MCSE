AB This paper presents a rapid response system architecture for the distributed management of warehouses in logistics by applying the concept of tiered edge computing. A tiered edge node architecture is proposed for the system to process computing tasks of different complexity, and a corresponding rapid response algorithm is introduced. The paper emphasizes the classification of abstracted outlier sensing data which could better match different sensing types and transplant to various application fields. A software-defined simulation is used to evaluate the system performance on response time and response accuracy, from which it can be concluded that common predefined emergency cases can be detected and responded to, rapidly.
