AB Cloud computing has been critical and seen more progress in the field of education. Many educational institutions have applied the cloud computing classroom as a platform to engage students learning online. However, there remains a lack of research on users' perceived fit and performance in the context to better evaluate the efficacy of cloud computing classroom in fulfilling students' needs. This study attempts to explore whether there is a fit between students' motivations and characteristics of services provided by the cloud computing classroom, and whether this fit contributes to positive outcome of student performance. Mixed research methods were used because of novelty of cloud computing classroom context. First, propositions were extracted from in-depth interviews. Then, the propositions were converted into hypotheses and were further confirmed by a quantitative survey. The results indicated that the characteristics of the services provided by the cloud computing class room fit user's needs, and the fit significantly affects users' performance.
