AB Cloud databases have been used in a spate of web-based applications in recent years owing to their capacity to store big data efficiently. In such a scenario, access control techniques implemented in relational databases are so modified as to suit cloud databases. The querying features of cloud databases are designed with facilities to retrieve encrypted data. The performance with respect to retrieval and security needs further improvements to ensure a secured retrieval process. In order to provide an efficient secured retrieval mechanism, a rule- and agent-based intelligent secured retrieval model has been proposed in this paper that analyzes the user, query and contents to be retrieved so as to effect rapid retrieval with decryption from the cloud databases. The major advantage of this retrieval model is in terms of its improved query response time and enhanced security of the storage and retrieval system. From the experiments conducted in this work, proposed model increased storage and access time and, in addition, intensified the security of the data stored in cloud databases.
