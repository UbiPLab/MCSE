AB The animation rendering time can be greatly reduced and the rendering effects can be improved when cloud computing is applied in a 3D animation rendering system. In view of this, this paper starts from the previous studies of Chinese researchers regarding cloud computing and 3D animation rendering system, and elaborates the relevant theories of cloud computing and cloud rendering, as well as the key technologies in cloud computing-based rendering. A cloud computing-based 3D animation rendering system is designed including its basic framework and workflow. Hopefully the 3D animation rendering system may make full use of the advantages of cloud computing, reduce the rendering time and cost, and improve rendering effects.
