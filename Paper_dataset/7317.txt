AB Geospatial cloud computing offers computing infrastructure, software and data services that enable rapid integration of ecological data from various resources. The objectives of this study were to utilize readily available and low-cost technology (e.g., GPS-enabled cameras, Cloud photo storage, Google Drive) to create a cloud based spatial temporal inventory of plant (including flowering phenology) and other relevant information. An interactive ArcGIS Online Map of Lake Issaqueena, SC with sampling locations of flowering plants allows users to obtain additional information (plant, soil, weather data) by selecting sampling locations or soil polygons. The contents of the map can be filtered using any of the attributes (e.g., growth form) in the data tables by selecting specific information. Plant information can be viewed at custom time intervals using the settings in ArcGIS Online. Spatial patterns (e.g., clustering) in the plant data can be viewed using the ArcGIS Online heat map view. The map can be easily queried and viewed on both computers and hand-held devices. Services from multiple cloud infrastructures can be integrated for use by various species monitoring programs, improving workflow and assessment capabilities.
