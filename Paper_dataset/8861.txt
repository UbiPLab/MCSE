AB Aiming to resolve the mobile commerce scenario suggested problems, cloud computing technology and mobile user context are combined to propose a collaborative filtering model based on user interest in mobile scenarios. Through computing the scene similarity based on mobile users, we find similar scenarios constructed target user set current situation, and then establish the item scoring scene and scoring matrix.
