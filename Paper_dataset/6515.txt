AB More and more companies utilize High Performance Computing in order to run their software. Besides the use of supercomputers and clusters, grid and cloud computing can be used and thanks to today's GPUs technology, many-core solutions can be integrated to speed up running times and add a lot more resources at users' disposal.
   In this article, the development and simulation of a High Performance System based on Cloud, Clusters and low cost devices is presented. The system is simulated by using C and is tested in a real case scenario by utilizing the Java Parallel Processing Framework. The aim of this work is to study the possibilities of combining any available computational resource in order to reduce costs and energy consumption.
   We show that the combination of any resource that is available can result in a significant decrease in the execution time and expenses. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
