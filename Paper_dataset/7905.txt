AB The majority of Mobile Cloud Computing architectures do not currently take into account resource usage or the costs of running the system in the Cloud, and an assumption is usually made that there is only one virtual machine per user. This approach blocks the large-scale adoption of Mobile Cloud Computing. We apply architectural patterns that are common in traditional Cloud Computing in order to decrease resource demand in Mobile Cloud Computing. We present and compare three architectures: the reference one, which represents the current common approach, and two architectures that leverage the multi tenancy and asynchrony concepts in order to reduce cloud resource usage. The evaluation conducted has demonstrated that architectures using common Cloud Computing patterns can reduce the resources used by the current approach by 4 while serving 23 times more tasks. This proves that applying common Cloud Computing patterns to the Mobile Cloud Computing environment is a good way of constraining resource demand. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
