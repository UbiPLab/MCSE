AB y With its continuing socio-economic development, China faces the challenge of meeting the growing energy demand. Industrial parks with combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) achieve better comprehensive economic and environmental benefits due to energy cascade utilization. A new enterprise entering an industrial park with CCHP needs to select a reasonable cold and heat source scheme (CHSS). Therefore, this paper presents a method for new enterprises to select an appropriate CHSS. This method is based on comprehensive economic and environmental benefit, using minimal annual average cost in operation optimization mode as a quantitative indicator, and the calculation process uses the improved differential evolution algorithm using the MATLAB software. Finally, a cloud computing center of an industrial park with CCHP in Chongqing is used as a case study to assess the method. Results show that the scheme of lithium bromide absorption refrigerator driven with steam can be accepted by the cloud computing center only steam price below 112.6yuan/t, which can promote energy cascade utilization in the industrial park. This method assists new enterprises entering the industrial park in selecting their energy system scheme. In addition, the method can assist energy supply enterprises to determine energy trade prices and also expand their user base. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
