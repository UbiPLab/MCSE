AB The latency issue of cloud based system can degrade smart grid's real-time applications. This paper introduces a fog computing layer between the cloud and clients to provide energy management service in near real-time with optimised computing cost. In a region, in proposed system model, two clusters of residential buildings have access to two fogs for processing of their energy requests. A hybrid service broker policy and modified honey bee colony optimisation algorithm are proposed for efficient fog selection and balancing requests' load on virtual machines in the fog. The micro grids (MGs) are introduced in the system model between the fogs and the clusters for uninterrupted and cost-efficient power supply. The recurring cost of MGs and computing cost of the fogs make the system operation cost, which is payable by the consumers. The simulation validate the efficient system operation cost, processing and RT for power consumers.
