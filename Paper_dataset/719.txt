AB Edge computing has already shown its potential benefits to support the delay-sensitive and computation-intensive service provisioning in the Internet-of-Things-based environments. Simultaneously, artificial intelligence is expected to enhance the cognizance and intelligence of edge computing, resulting in a new paradigm, intelligent edge computing. However, as is evident, several new security and privacy-related issues will arise due to the distinct characteristics and working principles of intelligent edge computing. In this article, we focus on malicious attacks targeting the intelligent engines of edge computing. These attacks counteract the gains from intelligent systems and also compromise the edge computing system. We provide the main factors that are responsible for the security and privacy-related challenges in intelligent edge computing. Finally, the potential research directions in privacy and security-related issues are outlined for intelligent edge computing.
