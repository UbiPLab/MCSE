AB Outsourcing data to the cloud for computation and storage has been on the rise in recent years. In this paper we investigate the problem of supporting write operation on the outsourced data for clients using mobile devices. We consider the Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-based Encryption (CP-ABE) scheme as it is well suited to support access control in outsourced cloud environments. One shortcoming of CP-ABE is that users can modify the access policy specified by the data owner if write operations are incorporated in the scheme. We propose a protocol for collaborative processing of outsourced data that enables the authorized users to perform write operation without being able to alter the access policy specified by the data owner. Our scheme is accompanied with a light weight signature scheme and simple, inexpensive user revocation mechanism to make it suitable for processing on resource-constrained mobile devices. The implementation and detailed performance analysis of the scheme indicate the suitability of the proposed scheme for real mobile applications. Moreover, the security analysis demonstrates that the security properties of the system are not compromised.
