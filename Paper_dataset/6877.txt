AB Considering the relation between Enterprise Architecture (EA) and IT is a prerequisite when promoting the uptake of IT by societies. In this paper, the authors propose an "Adaptive Integrated EA framework," based on the results of a survey, to support the strategy of promoting cloud/mobile IT. They considered a unique advanced case and provide details and the structure/mechanism of building this EA framework in a global pharmaceutical company. Moreover, the authors revealed the effectiveness of the proposed EA framework by evaluating/analyzing the problems caused by the rapid shift to cloud/mobile IT in divisions in the US and Europe. Furthermore, they compared the characteristics of The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) and the "Adaptive Integrated EA framework" (global deployment) in building EA frameworks while evaluating the effectiveness of this framework to achieve digital transformation. Finally, the authors clarify the challenges, benefits, and critical success factors of the framework to assist EA practitioners with its implementation.
