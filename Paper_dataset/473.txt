AB Network function virtualization (NFV) and mobile edge computing (MEC) are two of the promising technologies that are expected to play a critical role in mobile edge cloud networks, thus satisfying ambitious quality of experience (QoE) requirements of the Internet of things (IoT) applications. In MEC-NFV system, a service function chain (SFC) consists of an ordered set of virtual network functions (VNFs) that are connected based on the business logic of service providers. However, the inefficiency of the SFC orchestration process is one major problem due to the dynamic nature of mobile edge cloud networks and abundance of IoT terminals. In this letter, a quantum machine learning (QML)-based scheme is proposed as solution that can handle complex and dynamic SFC orchestration in mobile edge cloud networks. Simulation results show that our proposal significantly provides more than 8-fold reduction of run time compared to the Viterbi algorithm, and the end-to-end delay is only about 1.1 times of the exact solution.
