AB The Internet of Things (IoT) leads to intelligent services by collecting information from tiny sensor devices. In recent years, storage-less sensing devices have been used to implement IoT services. They depend on delivered software from a network server to operate service functions, and IoT services are based on collected user information. Therefore, it is important to maintain trusted connections during software delivery or data transmission. If a network connection is untrustworthy, stable data transmission cannot be achieved. Untrustworthy data connections cause many problems in IoT services. Therefore, this paper proposes a software update method in trusted connection of IoT networking. The proposed method employs a low-power wide area network (LPWAN) as a long-range IoT networking technology and uses a mobile edge cloud to improve computing efficiency in an access network that consists of IoT devices with insufficient resources. In the proposed method, the mobile edge cloud is integrated into a gateway and processes sensing data and remote software updates of LPWAN. IoT devices can receive software functions from the mobile edge cloud. The proposed method analyzes statistical information about connections in an access network and determines the LPWAN trusted connections. Then, software updates can be performed over the trusted connection. Using trusted connections leads to an increased packet delivery rate and reduced transmission energy consumption. The proposed method is compared with currently available systems through computer simulation and the proposed method's efficiency is validated.
