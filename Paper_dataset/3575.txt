AB Mobile cloud computing (MCC) is an emerging technology to relieve the tension between compute-intensive mobile applications and resource-constrained mobile terminals by offloading computing tasks to remote cloud servers. In this paper, we consider a novel MCC architecture consisting of remote cloud server, cloudlet and mobile terminal to guarantee low latency and low energy mobile consumption. To overcome the main bottlenecks of wireless bandwidth between mobile terminal and cloudlet, and the computation capability of cloudlet, the joint optimization strategy is proposed to enhance the quality of mobile cloud service. We formulate the wireless bandwidth and computing resource allocation model as a triple-stage Stackelberg game, and solve it by using backward method. In addition, the interplays of triple-stage game are discussed and the subgame optimal equilibrium for each stage is analyzed. An iterative algorithm is proposed to obtain Stackelberg equilibrium. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
