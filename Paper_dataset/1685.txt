AB The cloud and fog computing paradigms are developing area for storing, processing, and analysis of geospatial big data. Latest trend is mist computing which boost fog and cloud concepts for computing process where edge devices are used to help increase throughput and reduce latency to support at client edge. The present research article discussed the mist computing emergence for geospatial analysis of data from various geospatial applications. It also created a framework based on mist computing, i.e., MistGIS for analytics in mining domain from geospatial big data. The developed MistGIS platform is used in Tourism Information Infrastructure Management and Faculty Information Retrial System. Tourism Information Infrastructure Management is to assimilate entire geospatial data in context to travel/tourism places constitute of various lakes, mountains, rivers, forests, temples, mosques, churches, monuments, etc. It can aid all the stakeholders or users to acquire sufficient data in subsequent research studies. In this study, it has taken the Temple City of India, Bhubaneswar as the case study. Whereas Faculty Information Retrial System facilitated many functionalities with respect to finding the detail information of faculties according to their research area, contact details, and email ids, etc in all 31 National Institutes of Technology (NITs) in India. The framework is built with the Raspberry Pi microprocessor. The MistGIS platform has been confirmed by prelude analysis which includes cluster and overlay. The outcome show that mist computing assist cloud and fog computing to provide the analysis of geospatial big data.
