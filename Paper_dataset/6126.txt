AB Gradually, mobile and smart computing devices are becoming pervasive and prevalent in society and also increasingly being used to undertake the daily tasks and business activities of individuals and organizations worldwide as compared to their desktop counterparts. But these mobile and smart computing devices are resource constrained and sometimes lack the needed computational capacities; thus, memory, energy, storage, and processor to run the plethora of resource intensive applications available for mobile users. There is a lot of benefit of offloading resource demanding applications and intensive computations from mobile devices to other systems with higher resource capacities in the cloud. Mobile cloud computing is a form of cloud computing that seeks to enhance the capacity and capabilities of mobile and smart computing devices by enabling mobile devices to offload some computational tasks to the cloud for processing which otherwise would have been a challenge. The study setup an experiment to investigate computation offloading for mobile devices. The study also presented an energy model for computation offloading. It was observed during the experiment that by offloading intensive applications from mobile and smart computing devices to other systems with higher resource capacities, a great amount of resource efficiency is achieved.
