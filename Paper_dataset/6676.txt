AB Traditional TCP/IP network is showing lots of shortages and research for future networks is becoming a hotspot. FIA (Future Internet Architecture) and FIA-NP (Next Phase) are supported by US NSF for future Internet designing. Moreover, virtual machine migration is a significant technique in cloud computing. As a network application, it should also be supported in XIA (eXpressive Internet Architecture), which is in both FIA and FIA-NP projects. Current research just achieved to conduct VM migration in XIA, but the performance is not satisfactory. In this paper, we firstly present three methods including DAG design and routing table modification to maintain VM's connectivity and communication states, concerning performance and overhead. VM migration experiments are conducted intra-AD, inter-AD and across IP network with KVM instances. The procedure is achieved by a migration control protocol which is suitable for the characters of XIA. Secondly, we propose a triple-way pipeline to improve the performance of chunk mode data transfer and greatly reduce total migration time and downtime. Evaluation results show that our solutions can well supports full live VM migration over XIA network respectively, keeping services seamless and performance improved. Furthermore, the optimization scheme can greatly improve the speed of VM migration, especially on XIA testbed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
