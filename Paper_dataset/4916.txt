AB Data collaboration in cloud computing ismore and more popular nowadays, and proxy deployment schemes are employed to realize cross-cloud data collaboration. However, data security and privacy are the most serious issues that would raise great concerns from users when they adopt cloud systems to handle data collaboration. Different cryptographic techniques are deployed in different cloud service providers, which makes cross-cloud data collaboration to be a deeper challenge. In this paper, we propose an adaptive secure cross-cloud data collaboration scheme with identity-based cryptography (IBC) and proxy re-encryption (PRE) techniques. We first present a secure cross-cloud data collaboration framework, which protects data confidentiality with IBC technique and transfers the collaborated data in an encrypted form by deploying a proxy close to the clouds. We then provide an adaptive conditional PRE protocol with the designed full identity-based broadcast conditional PRE algorithm, which can achieve flexible and conditional data re-encryption among ciphertexts encrypted in identity-based encryption manner and ciphertexts encrypted in identity-based broadcast encryption manner. The extensive analysis and experimental evaluations demonstrate the well security and performance of our scheme, which meets the secure data collaboration requirements in cross-cloud scenarios.
