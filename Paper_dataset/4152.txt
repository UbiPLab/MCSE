AB Internet of Things (IoT) leverages the sensor inter-connectivity that offers a wide range of real-time monitoring opportunities for smart environmental systems. As a consequence, it is witnessed that IoT plays an important role in the next generation of smart communication networks. In the future, the evolution of smart environment becomes a pillar of 2020 society for the various innovative services. In order to deal with the challenges, such as supporting urban development and improving the quality of people's life, an interdisciplinary approach is preferred. It is evident that the infrastructure of smart information and communication technology (ICT) claims to be a de facto standard to realize the smart vision of emerging technologies. Thus, an IoT-Based Smart CAN (IoT-BSFCAN) framework is proposed to monitor the smart environment continuously through smart computing devices over cloud-enabled networks. The objective of this framework is to minimize computation cost along with communication fairness, while it uses different kinds of user applications. Moreover, the illustrative result proves that the proposed IoT-BSFCAN framework yields better successful execution results than the other alternative solutions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.
