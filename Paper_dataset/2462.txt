AB Full-duplex (FD)-fog nodes with wireless backhaul can improve the flexibility of deployment for 5G ultra density networks. However, under computation-intensive environments, the insufficient computing resource of fog nodes leads to the increase of backhaul for cloud computing. In this letter, we introduce in-band full-duplex communications to cooperatively integrate the fog computing and cloud computing. By considering the statistical variation of the computation delay caused by co-located and concurrent workload, we construct an M/M/1 queuing to model the computing delay. We comprehensively analyze the outage performance for both the communication and the computing procedure, which is close to actual systems. Moreover, ergodic computation rate is proposed to investigate the computation capability of the FD-fog computing systems. Simulations results verify the accuracy of our analysis, and the cooperative fog-cloud computing framework outperforms the existing fog computing system.
