AB Cloud computing is a trending technology, as it reduces the cost of running a business. However, many companies are skeptic moving about towards cloud due to the security concerns. Based on the Cloud Security Alliance report, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are among top 12 attacks in the cloud computing. Therefore, it is important to develop a mechanism for detection and prevention of these attacks. The aim of this paper is to evaluate Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm in creating the model for classification of DoS attacks and normal network behaviors. The study was performed in several phases: a) attack simulation, b) data collection, c) feature selection, and d) classification. The proposed model achieved 100% classification accuracy with true positive rate (TPR) of 100%. SVM showed outstanding performance in DoS attack detection and proves that it serves as a valuable asset in the network security area.
