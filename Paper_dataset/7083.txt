AB Cloud computing enables access to computing, processing and storage resources as a service. These services offered to users through internet and based on payment obligations. There are various service providers and services for users, so users have the challenge of choosing appropriate service, matching their needs. Therefore, having a system which helps users to choose the best service based on their need is very important. In this paper, we propose a new multi-agent based method named ARank, which is applied for ranking algorithm to reduce the waiting time of users. ARank method uses intelligent agents which they choose some candidate services and rank these services based on the quality of service values. Furthermore, the agents of ARank include the satisfaction rate of the earlier users in ranking process. The results of our evaluation show reduction in the waiting time of the users using ARank method, compared to the existing related work, Analytic Hierarchical Process (AHP) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
