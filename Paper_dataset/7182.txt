AB Cloud computing has attained tremendous popularity recently, leading to its fast and rapid deployment. However, privacy and security concerns have also increased in the same ratio. The adoption of cloud model has revealed new dimensions of attack, demanding major reconsideration and reevaluation of traditional security mechanisms. If an organization is operating in cloud environment without adopting essential security measures, it may face catastrophic consequences including loss of valuable data, financial damages, or reputation loss etc. Any organization in cloud architecture faces severe security threats and challenges for which a comprehensive security framework is needed. Certain frameworks exist in literature which focus deeply on specific cloud security issues; however, there is a dire need of comprehensive framework encompassing both security-related and management-related issues. This paper initially reviews security challenges and threats to data/applications in cloud environment. Furthermore, a comprehensive security and management framework is proposed for an organization operating in cloud environment. Proposed framework has been implemented in virtualized cloud environment to validate the efficacy of certain features of the model. The data center has been setup in virtualized environment through virtual machines on VMware ESXi-6 hypervisor layer. VMware vCloud-6 has been installed on top of it for provision of services to the users. The proposed framework is a set of guidelines that will adequately secure the organization's data and applications. The framework incorporates a layered security architecture to achieve utmost level of security for nullifying the impact of threats.
