AB Spontaneous ad hoc cloud computing networks let us perform complex tasks in a distributed manner by sharing computing resources. This kind of infrastructure is based on mobile devices with limited processing and storage capacity. Nodes with more processing capacity and energy in a spontaneous network store data or perform computing tasks in order to increase the whole computing and storage capacity. However, these networks can also present some problems of security and data vulnerability. In this paper, we present a secure spontaneous mobile ad hoc cloud computing network to make estimations using several information sources. The application is able to create users and manage encryption methods to protect the data sent through the network. The proposal has been simulated in several scenarios. The results show that the network performance depends mainly on the network size and nodes mobility.
