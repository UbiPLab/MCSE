AB Mobile cloud computing (MCC) is a state-of-the-art architecture that integrates the cloud computing into the mobile environment and overcomes obstacles, such as processing capability, battery life, storage, and availability. Also the MCC is expected to be a key technology for cyber physical systems by connecting to vehicular systems, medical systems, and other mission-critical systems. Therefore, it is a critical issue for MCC to guarantee the high reliability. In this paper, we consider the component importance analysis of an MCC with common-cause failures (CCFs) by using a Markov reward modelbased componentwise sensitivity approach. The component importance analysis is capable of quantifying the criticality of components and helps us to design the highly reliable system. In particular, this paper examines the effect of CCFs on the MCC. Our experimental results show that the preferred action to improve the availability of system with CCFs efficiently is to decrease the failure rate of the cloud node in the cloud infrastructure.
