AB Cloud computing is the developing design of IT enterprise. Applications and the services that are present over the Internet are referred by the cloud computing. Critical issues on security and trust based are often a major problem in cloud computing. Different levels of security enforcement are offered by both public and private clouds. Auditing plays a vital role in evaluating an individual, process, system, product or an enterprise. A renaissance system model has been proposed for secure data storage in cloud. The proposed model involves four entities: Data owners, the cloud, cloud service provider and third party auditor (TPA). The TPA has the ability to create the awareness in order to bring out the public audits in the cloud having the coded data. The outcome seems to be trusted and is impartial for both the cloud servers and the data owners. The proposed model is a semi trusted proxy agent that performances instead of the data owner in order to reinstate the data blocks that are obtained during the repair process. Renaissance system model is proposed and implemented into the test bed.
