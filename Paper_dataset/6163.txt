AB Big Data (BD) is a new technology which rapidly growing in the telecommunications sectors, especially in the contemporary field of wireless telecommunications. Another technology that grows rapidly in the field of wireless telecommunications is Cloud Computing (CC). CC concerns an infrastructure where data storage and processing take place outside of the user's device. Both of them face security and privacy issues in their function. In order to improve them and to optimize their privacy and security issues conducted the present survey. In this paper, we survey BD and CC technology and their basic characteristics, with a focus on the security and privacy issues of both technologies. Specifically, we try to combine the functionality of the two technologies (i.e BD and CC) with the aim to examine the frequent features, and also to discover the benefits related in security issues of their integration. Concluding, we present a new method of an algorithm that can be used for the purpose of improving Cloud Computing's security through the use of algorithms that can provide more privacy in the data related to Big Data technology. At the end, there is a survey about the challenges of the integration of BD and CC related to their security level.
