AB In the distributed data-intensive computing environment, securely assigning tasks to appropriate machines is a big job scheduling problem. The complexity of this problem increases with the number of jobs and their job times. Several meta-heuristic algorithms including particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique and variable neighborhood particle swarm optimization (VNPSO) technique are employed to solve the problem to a certain extent. This paper proposes a modified PSO with scout adaptation (MPSO-SA) algorithm, which uses a cyclic term called mutation operator, to solve the job scheduling problem in the cloud environment. The comparative study between the proposed MPSO-SA scheduling mechanism and the conventional scheduling algorithms show that the proposed method decreases the probability of security risk on scheduling the jobs.
