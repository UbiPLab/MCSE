ID KEYWORD RANKED SEARCH
AB Most of the existing searchable encryption schemes can not support fuzzy keyword search, and can not resist threats from malicious server, that the cloud computing needs to provide an encryption scheme, which can support typos and verification of the search result. Considering the data is updated frequently in cloud computing, a verifiable fuzzy searchable encryption scheme in dynamic cloud storage is presented. The proposed scheme constructs the fuzzy keyword set based on edit distance technique, and builds secure index based on pseudorandom function and random permutation, so as to protect the users' data privacy. The RSA accumulator and Hash function are used to verify the correctness of the search result, in order to detect the cheating behavior of the malicious attacker. The security analysis proves that the proposed scheme is privacy preserving and verifiable. The experiment results show that the proposed scheme is efficient.
