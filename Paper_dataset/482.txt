ID ENCRYPTION
AB The digitization of health records due to technological developments has paved the way for patients to be collaboratively treated by different healthcare institutions. In collaborative ehealth systems, a patient's health data is stored remotely in the cloud for sharing with different healthcare service providers. However, the use of third parties for storage exposes the data to several privacy and security violation threats. Ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) which provides a fine-grained access control is a promising solution to privacy and security issues in the cloud environment and as a result, it has been widely studied for secure sharing of health data in cloud-based ehealth systems. Addressing the aspects of expressiveness, efficiency, user collusion resistance and attribute/user revocation in CP-ABE have been at the forefront of these studies. Thus, in this article, we proposed a novel expressive, efficient and collusion-resistant access control scheme with immediate attribute/user revocation for secure sharing of health data in collaborative ehealth systems. The proposed scheme additionally achieves forward and backward security. To realize these features, our access control is based on the ordered binary decision diagram (OBDD) access structure and it binds the user keys to the user identities. Security and performance analysis show that our proposed scheme is secure, expressive and efficient.
