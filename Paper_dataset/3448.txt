AB The use of the fleet management system significantly facilitates and improves the organization and business of modern transport companies. The fleet management system enables automation and business process optimization by linking all segments of business (disposition, procurement, communication, navigation, accounting and finances). They use modern technology solutions such as satellite navigation system, mobile technology, wireless communication and data transfer, cloud computing and telemetry (vehicle sensors, remote diagnostics devices). The fleet management system can determine the position of any vehicle in real time, make remote control of a vehicle and perform various measurements, record and optimize routes, monitor the driver's working hours, monitor costs (fuel and other), store the collected data for their search, analysis, and creating reports. The paper provides a comparative analysis of three fleet management systems (Mobilisis, CVS Mobile and My GPS) based on their real use in a transport company. The systems are analyzed and compared according to interface customization, vehicle tracking, reports, fuel consumption monitoring and cost control, work order and travel warrant, and by communication between drivers and disponent. It has been found out that Mobilisis provides the most comprehensive solution, although the most expensive one, while My GPS has all the necessary functionality at a much lower price, and a disadvantage of CVS Mobile is the inability to make travel warrants.
