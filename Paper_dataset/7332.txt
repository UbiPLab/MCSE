AB Purpose: To use 3-dimensional custom CAD technology to evaluate how knee flexion angle affects femoral tunnel length and distance to the posterior wall when using curved and straight guides for drilling through the anteromedial portal (AMP). Methods: Six cadaveric knees were placed in an external fixator at various degrees of flexion (90 degrees, 110 degrees, 125 degrees, and maximum 135 degrees to 140 degrees). Computed tomography scans were obtained at all flexion points for 3-dimensional point-cloud models. Using custom CAD software, surgical guides through the AMP were replicated along with virtual tunnels at each flexion angle. Distance from the posterior cortex and tunnel dimensions were collected after 8-mm and 10-mm tunnel creation. Results: At 90 degrees of flexion, the average tunnel length down the posterior aspect of 8-mm tunnel was 25.0 mm (95% confidence interval [CI] 16.2-33.8) and 12.0 mm (95% CI 7.3-16.7) for curved and straight guides, respectively; 31.0mm(95% CI 26.8-35.2) and 28.6mm(95% CI 24.8-32.4) at 110 degrees; 33.8mm(95% CI 30.1-37.5) and 31.1mm(95% CI 26.8-35.4) at 125 degrees; and 35.0 mm (95% CI 34.1-35.9) and 35.5 mm (95% CI 34.2-36.8) with maximal flexion. Values between curved and straight guides are significantly different (P < .001), with straight guides breaching the posterior wall at 90 degrees and 110 degrees of flexion in some specimens. The average distance to the posterior wall cortex was 0.9 mm (95% CI -1.5 to 3.3) and -0.6 mm (95% CI -2.3 to 1.1) for curved and straight guides, respectively, at 90 degrees of flexion (P = .014); 2.3 mm (95% CI -0.2 to 4.8) and -0.1mm(95% CI -2.4 to 2.2) at 110 degrees (P = .001); 4.4mm(95% CI 2.8-6.0) and 3.9mm(95% CI 1.9-5.9) at 125 degrees (P= .299); and 6.7 mm (95% CI 6.2-7.2) and 8.3 mm (95% CI 6.1-10.5) at maximal flexion (P = .184). Posterior wall blowout was noted when using 10-mm straight guides at both 90 degrees (2 specimens) and 110 degrees (3 specimens). Using 10-mm curved guides posterior blowout was noted in 1 specimen at 90 degrees. Maximum footprint coverage occurred at 110 degrees for straight guides and 90 degrees for curved guides. Conclusions: When using the AMP, flexible guides and reamers result in a greater distance of the tunnel to the femoral cortex while preserving adequate tunnel length at lower knee flexion angles. To create long femoral tunnels without breaching the posterior cortex, the knee should be flexed to at least 110 degrees for curved reamers and 125 degrees for straight.
