AB This paper proposes a novel context-aware fog computing framework for intelligent transportation systems (ITS) called CFC-ITS. This scheme consists of multiple intelligent tiers: Internet of Things tier, fog service tier, and global cloud service tier supporting edge analytics for ITS services in a connected car environment. Each tier on the fog senses different contexts like location, time, available resources, and estimated response time for efficiently processing tasks to provide delay-sensitive services while optimizing virtualized resources. A preliminary prototype and a testbed for this study were built to validate the robustness of the proposed approach.
