AB In the virtualization technology, cloud computing is a pool of abundant computing resources and delivers on-demand Internet-based computing services. One of the challenging issues in the virtualization is the placement of virtual machines (VMs) on the physical machines (PMs) such that the computing resources can be utilized efficiently. Furthermore, imbalanced usage of multi-dimensional resources may lead to overall resource wastage and SLA violations of a cloud data center. In this paper, we propose a new VM placement algorithm called multi-objective virtual machine placement (MOVMP) for IaaS cloud. In the algorithm, we devise a resource usage factor (RUF) to maximize the resource usage of the PMs during placement of the VMs. Further, we also present a mull-dimensional resource usage model, which direct to minimize the number of under-loaded PMs in IaaS cloud. This model also helps to improve resource utilization in a balanced manner and migrate a less number of VMs, which results in minimizing the resource wastage, power consumption, and the service level agreement (SLA) violations of cloud data center. The algorithm is tested using Amazon EC2 Instances. Through comparison results, we show that the proposed algorithm performs better than the existing ones in terms of various performance metrics.
