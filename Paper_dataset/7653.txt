AB \Cloud computing provides services and infrastructures to enable end-users to access, modify and share massive geographically distributed data. There are increasing interests in developing data-intensive (big data) applications in this computing environment that need to access huge datasets. Accessing such data in an efficient way is deterred with factors such as dynamic changes in resource availability, provision of diverse service quality by different cloud providers. Data replication has already been proven to be an effective technique to overcome these challenges. Replication offers reduced response time in data access, higher data availability and improved system load balancing. Once the replicas are created in a multi-cloud environment, it is of utmost importance to continuously support maintenance of these replicas dynamically. This is to ensure that replicas are located in optimal data center locations to minimize replication cost and to meet specific user and system requirements. First, this paper proposes a novel approach to distributed placement of static replicas in appropriate data center locations. Secondly, motivated by the fact that a multi-cloud environment is highly dynamic, the paper presents a dynamic replica maintenance technique that reallocates replicas to new data center locations upon significant performance degradation. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented dynamic maintenance technique with static placement decisions in a multi-cloud environment.
