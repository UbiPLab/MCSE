AB Aiming at the problem of service reliability in resource reservation in cloud computing environments, a model of dynamic cloud resource reservation based on trust is proposed. A domain-specific cloud management architecture is designed in which resources are divided into different management domains according to the types of service for easier management. A dynamic resource reservation mechanism (DRRM) is used to test users' reservation requests and reserve resources for users. According to user preference, several resources are chosen to be candidate resources by fuzzy cluster analysis. The fuzzy evaluation method and a two-way trust evaluation mechanism are adopted to improve the availability and credibility of the model. An analysis and simulation experiments show that this model can increase the flexibility of resource reservation and improve user satisfaction.
