AB As an emerging technology, cloud computing is a revolution in information technology that attracts significant attention from both public and private sectors. In this paper, we proposed a dynamic approach for live migration to obviate overloaded machines. This approach is applied on OpenStack, which rapidly grows in an open source cloud computing platform. We conducted a cost-aware dynamic live migration for virtual machines (VMs) at an appropriate time to obviate the violation of service level agreement (SLA) before it happens. We conducted a preemptive migration to offload physical machine (PM) before the overload situation depending on the predictive method. We have carried out a distributed model, a predictive method, and a dynamic threshold policy, which are efficient for the scalable environment as cloud computing.
   Experimental results have indicated that our model succeeded in avoiding the overload at a suitable time. The simulation results from our solution remarked the very efficient reduction of VM migrations and SLA violation, which could help cloud providers to deliver a good quality of service (QoS).
