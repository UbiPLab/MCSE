AB Cloud computing is increasing rapidly as a successful paradigm presenting on-demand infrastructure, platform, and software services to clients. Load balancing is one of the important issues in cloud computing to distribute the dynamic workload equally among all the nodes to avoid the status that some nodes are overloaded while others are underloaded. Many algorithms have been suggested to perform this task. Recently, worldview is turning into a new paradigm for optimization search by applying the osmosis theory from chemistry science to form osmotic computing. Osmotic computing is aimed to achieve balance in highly distributed environments. The main goal of this paper is to propose a hybrid metaheuristics technique which combines the osmotic behavior with bio-inspired load balancing algorithms. The osmotic behavior enables the automatic deployment of virtual machines (VMs) that are migrated through cloud infrastructures. Since the hybrid artificial bee colony and ant colony optimization proved its efficiency in the dynamic environment in cloud computing, the paper then exploits the advantages of these bio-inspired algorithms to form an osmotic hybrid artificial bee and ant colony (OH_BAC) optimization load balancing algorithm. It overcomes the drawbacks of the existing bio-inspired algorithms in achieving load balancing between physical machines. The simulation results show that OH_BAC decreases energy consumption, the number of VMs migrations and the number of shutdown hosts compared to existing algorithms. In addition, it enhances the quality of services (QoSs) which is measured by service level agreement violation (SLAV) and performance degradation due to migrations (PDMs).
