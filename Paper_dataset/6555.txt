ID PRESERVATION
AB Due to widespread growth of cloud technology, virtual server accomplished in cloud platform may collect useful data from a client and then jointly disclose the client's sensitive data without permission. Hence, from the perspective of cloud clients, it is very important to take confident technical actions to defend their privacy at client side. Accordingly, different privacy protection techniques have been presented in the literature for safeguarding the original data. This paper presents a technique for privacy preservation of cloud data using Kronecker product and Bat algorithm- based coefficient generation. Overall, the proposed privacy preservation method is performed using two important steps. In the first step, PU coefficient is optimally found out using PUBAT algorithm with new objective function. In the second step, input data and PU coefficient is then utilized for finding the privacy protected data for further data publishing in cloud environment. For the performance analysis, the experimentation is performed with three datasets namely, Cleveland, Switzerland and Hungarian and evaluation is performed using accuracy and DBDR. From the outcome, the proposed algorithm obtained the accuracy of 94.28% but the existing algorithm obtained only the 83.64% to prove the utility. On the other hand, the proposed algorithm obtained DBDR of 35.28% but the existing algorithm obtained only 12.89% to prove the privacy measure.
