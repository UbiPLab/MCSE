AB In vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), efficient message dissemination is critical to road safety and traffic efficiency. Since many VANET-based schemes suffer from high transmission delay and data redundancy, the integrated VANET-cellular heterogeneous network has been proposed recently and attracted significant attention. However, most existing studies focus on selecting suitable gateways to deliver safety message from the source vehicle to a remote server, whereas rapid safety message dissemination from the remote server to a targeted area has not been well studied. In this paper, we propose a framework for rapid message dissemination that combines the advantages of diverse communication and cloud computing technologies. Specifically, we propose a novel Cloud-assisted Message Downlink dissemination Scheme (CMDS), with which the safety messages in the cloud server are first delivered to the suitable mobile gateways on relevant roads with the help of cloud computing (where gateways are buses with both cellular and VANET interfaces), and then being disseminated among neighboring vehicles via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. To evaluate the proposed scheme, we mathematically analyze its performance and conduct extensive simulation experiments. Numerical results confirm the efficiency of CMDS in various urban scenarios.
