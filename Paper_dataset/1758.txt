AB Driven by security and real-time demands of Internet of Things (IoT), the timing of fog computing and edge computing have gradually come into place. Gateways bear more nearby computing, storage, analysis and as an intelligent broker of the whole computing lifecycle in between local devices and the remote cloud. In fog computing, the edge broker requires X-aware capabilities that combines software programmability, stream processing, hardware optimization and various connectivity to deal with such as security, data abstraction, network latency, service classification and workload allocation strategy. The prosperous of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) pushes the possibility of gateway capabilities further landed. In this paper, we propose a software-defined gateway (SDG) scheme for fog computing paradigm termed as Fog Computing Zero-Knowledge Gateway that strengthens data protection and resilience merits designed for industrial internet of things or highly privacy concerned hybrid cloud scenarios. It is a proxy for fog nodes and able to integrate with existing commodity gateways. The contribution is that it converts Privacy-Enhancing Technologies rules into provable statements without knowing original sensitive data and guarantees privacy rules applied to the sensitive data before being propagated while preventing potential leakage threats. Some logical functions can be offloaded to any programmable micro-controller embedded to achieve higher computing efficiency.
