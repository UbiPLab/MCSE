AB Accurate estimation of the abundance of the ethynyl (C2H) radical requires accurate radiative and collisional rate coefficients. Hyperfine-resolved rate coefficients for (de-)excitation of C2H in collisions with ortho-and para-H-2 are presented in this work. These rate coefficients were computed in time-independent close-coupling quantum scattering calculations that employed a potential energy surface recently computed at the coupled-clusters level of theory that describes the interaction of C2H with H-2. Rate coefficients for temperatures from 10 to 300 K were computed for all transitions among the first 40 hyperfine energy levels of C2H in collisions with ortho-and para-H-2. These rate coefficients were employed in simple radiative transfer calculations to simulate the excitation of C2H in typical molecular clouds.
