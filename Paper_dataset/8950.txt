AB Due to the high maintenance cost of traditional online auction system, poor load balance ability and down problems occurring in the peak value of system access, this paper aims to propose a solution to transit from traditional online auction system to cloud computing to get higher work efficiency, lower expenditure and less energy cost. The GAE platform is used to deploy application of the overall framework of online auction system in cloud computing, including development environment as well as online auction system components, and software architecture. The online auction negotiation algorithms in cloud computing are also proposed. Based on these key technologies, the business processes of the online auction system in cloud computing is designed, including users' login system, starting an auction, bidding processes, online auction data storage, and logout system. The online auction system constructed on GAE platform with cloud computing resources and storage ability can reduce the pressure of terminal equipment, which is more robust than traditional online auction system facing users' changeable needs in the process of online auction.
