AB The ever-increasing demand for cloud services is posing serious challenges to the scalability of the computing, storing, and networking infrastructure deployed inside the datacenters. To address these challenges, we formulate the integer linear program (ILP) model to minimize the spectrum and the switch port usage by exploiting transparent multi-hop connection capability in elastic optical interconnect architecture for datacenters. The proposed ILP model not only takes into account the networking resources but also the other resources (such as computing and storage) in order to achieve a joint resource optimization in intra-datacenter networks. The optimal results show that substantial savings in both spectrum and switching resources can be achieved by properly tuning the objective function of the proposed optimization strategy.
