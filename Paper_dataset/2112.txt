AB The Flipped classroom is an instructional strategy that has been adopted in many engineering universities and has proven to be effective methodology to improve the performance of the students in higher education. The Flipped classroom "flips" the traditional classroom; the students are involved with lecture notes or videos in out-class sessions and engage in an interactive, and collaborative in-class activities. In this research work, a model was proposed that incorporates the Visual, Auditory, Read and Kinesthetic (VARK) learning styles in a Flipped classroom which improves the higher order thinking skills of the learners. Higher order competency skills like Problem-solving, Critical thinking, and Creative thinking were assessed in the cloud-based Flipped classroom. MALAR competency for PCC (Problem-Solving, Critical Thinking, and Creative Thinking) competency skills are considered for assessment of higher-order competency skills of the learners.
