AB More and more cloud computing services are being applied in various fields; however, it is difficult for users and cloud computing service platforms to establish trust among each other. The trust value cannot be measured accurately or effectively. To solve this problem, we design a service-oriented cloud trust assessment model using a cloud model. We also design a subjective preference weight allocation (SPWA) algorithm. A flexible weight model is advanced by combining SPWA with the entropy method. Aiming at the fuzziness and subjectivity of trust, the cloud model is used to measure the trust value of various cloud computing services. The SPWA algorithm is used to integrate each evaluation result to obtain the trust evaluation value of the entire cloud service provider.
