AB This article presents new methods of securing data with particular emphasis on their applications in Cloud Computing. Methods of hiding data dedicated to processes of its security will be illustrated by cryptographic techniques, particularly data splitting protocols. Cryptographic information sharing algorithms are a particularly important type of techniques allowing confidential or secret data to be secured. These algorithms have been enhanced with new classes of solutions, including semantic protocols of secret sharing. The innovation of this solution consists in the presentation of smart data securing algorithms that use techniques of the semantic sharing of secret information. The information subjected to the process of splitting and hiding can take various forms, including that of services. Because of this aspect, namely, the various forms of the secret, and the use of universal information hiding techniques, a particularly important aspect of the solutions presented here is the ability to use them in various areas of data security. One of such areas comprises Cloud Computing, which forms the leading subject of this publication. In this article, the authors describe intelligent cryptography techniques dedicated to security services data. The most important achievement is the introduction of a new class of data encryption protocols, such as semantic threshold schemes.
