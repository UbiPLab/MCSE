AB As the growing of applications with big data in cloud computing become popular, many existing systems expect to expand their service to support the explosive increase of data. We propose a data adapter system to support hybrid database architecture including a relational database (RDB) and NoSQL database. It can support query from application and deal with database transformation at the same time. We provide three modes of query approach in data adapter system: blocking transformation mode (BT mode), blocking dump mode (BD mode), and direct access mode (DA mode). We provide a data synchronization mechanism and describe the design and implementation in detail. This paper focuses on velocity with proposed three modes and partly variety with data stored in RDB, NoSQL database and temporary files. With the proposed data adapter system, we can provide a seamless mechanism to use RDB and NoSQL database at the same time. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
