AB Prompted by the remarkable progress in both cloud computing and GPU virtualization, cloud gaming has become increasingly more popular in the gaming industry. In cloud gaming, games are stored and run on cloud servers and the gamers interact with games through thin clients. Cloud gaming service providers generally employ multiple geographically distributed data centers to deliver their services. The main challenge for cloud gaming service providers is to find the best tradeoff between two contradicting objectives: reducing the infrastructure operating costs and increasing the quality of players experience. In this paper, we address a virtual machine provisioning problem for multiplayer cloud gaming with the objective of minimizing both the inter-player delay among interacting players and the electricity costs of cloud gaming service providers, while providing the good-enough response delay to gamers. We formulate the problem into a constrained multiobjective optimization problem and propose an improved grey wolf algorithm to solve the problem. The performance of our proposed algorithm are assessed by simulation experiments based on the real-world parameters. The results show the superior performance of the proposed approach in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches applied to similar problems.
