AB The emergence of many new computing applications, such as Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and smart homes, has been made possible by the large pool of cloud resources and services. However, the cloud computing paradigm is unable to meet the requirements of delay-sensitive business applications, such as low latency, mobility support, and location awareness. In this context, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is introduced to improve the quality of experience (QoE) by bringing cloud resources and services closer to the user by leveraging available resources in the edge networks. However, the performance of MEC is dynamic in nature due to its location awareness, mobility and proximity. As a result, an effective mechanism is needed for providing efficient dynamic service maintenance for edge services. In this paper, we propose applying the Skyline Graph Model and employing the Directed Acyclic Graph theory to store and update mobile edge services. Specifically, the Skyline Graph (SG) algorithm is designed to solve the insertion, deletion, updating and searching of mobile edge services to achieve efficient maintenance for edge services. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on both real-world web services and simulated datasets to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approaches. The results show that our algorithms can achieve significantly better performance and robustness than the baseline algorithm.
