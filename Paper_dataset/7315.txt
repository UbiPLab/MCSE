AB The popularity of cloud computing has been on the rise in recent years, as cloud resources are not only shared by many users but can be allocated on demand. A recent survey reports success of the cyber criminals in using cloud computing technology for fraudulent activities, due to its essential characteristics and the lack of suitable digital forensic techniques for the cloud environment. While mitigating cloud crime, investigators face several challenges and issues dealing with cloud forensics. In this paper, the challenges faced by forensic investigators are highlighted. Most of the research work deals with the identification of challenges in cloud forensics and the proposed solutions reported in literature depends on Cloud Service Provider (CSP) for forensic investigation. The dependence on CSP includes the collection of data for the forensics process and there may be a chance of altering data that affects the entire investigation process. For mitigating the dependency on CSP, a new model for collecting forensic evidence outside the cloud environment is developed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
