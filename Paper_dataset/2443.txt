AB Dynamics of surface water is of great significance to understand the impacts of global changes and human activities on water resources. Remote sensing provides many advantages in monitoring surface water; however, in large scale, the efficiency of traditional remote sensing methods is extremely low because these methods consume a high amount of manpower, storage, and computing resources. In this paper, we propose a new method for quickly determining what the annual maximal and minimal surface water extent is. The maximal and minimal water extent in the year of 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2017 in the Middle Yangtze River Basin in China were calculated on the Google Earth Engine platform. This approach takes full advantage of the data and computing advantages of the Google Earth Engine's cloud platform, processed 2343 scenes of Landsat images. Firstly, based on the estimated value of cloud cover for each pixel, the high cloud covered pixels were removed to eliminate the cloud interference and improve the calculation efficiency. Secondly, the annual greenest and wettest images were mosaiced based on vegetation index and surface water index, then the minimum and maximum surface water extents were obtained by the Random Forest Classification. Results showed that (1) the yearly minimal surface water extents were 14,751.23 km(2), 14,403.48 km(2), 13,601.48 km(2), and 15,697.42 km(2), in the year of 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2017, respectively. (2) The yearly maximal surface water extents were 18,174.76 km(2), 20,671.83 km(2), 19,097.73 km(2), and 18,235.95 km(2), in the year of 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2017, respectively. (3) The accuracies of surface water classification ranged from 86% to 93%. Additionally, the causes of these changes were analyzed. The accuracy evaluation and comparison with other research results show that this method is reliable, novel, and fast in terms of calculating the maximal and minimal surface water extent. In addition, the proposed method can easily be implemented in other regions worldwide.
