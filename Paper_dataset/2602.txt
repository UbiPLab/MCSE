AB Phishing detection is recognized as a criminal issue of Internet security. By deploying a gateway anti-phishing in the networks, these current hardware-based approaches provide an additional layer of defense against phishing attacks. However, such hardware devices are expensive and inefficient in operation due to the diversity of phishing attacks. With promising technologies of virtualization in fog networks, an anti-phishing gateway can be implemented as software at the edge of the network and embedded robust machine learning techniques for phishing detection. In this paper, we use uniform resource locator features and Web traffic features to detect phishing websites based on a designed neuro-fuzzy framework (dubbed Fi-NFN). Based on the new approach, fog computing as encouraged by Cisco, we design an anti-phishing model to transparently monitor and protect fog users from phishing attacks. The experiment results of our proposed approach, based on a large-scale dataset collected from real phishing cases, have shown that our system can effectively prevent phishing attacks and improve the security of the network.
