AB Cloud computing is becoming an urgent technology in the enterprises. One key characteristic in the cloud computing is the elasticity. Then, it is urgent for the users how to rank the renting services reasonably. Considering the main features of the elasticity, this article gives classification on resource optimization. However, one of the major challenges is how to optimize resource allocation in an elastic manner. Due to the special pay-as-you-go manner, resource optimizing strategies are associated with the goal of minimizing the costs on the premise of service-level-agreement (SLA). Another challenge of resource optimizing strategies is to how to dynamically respond to the application demands. In this paper, the authors sketch the elastic definition more clearly. Secondly, different dimensions are described on elastic resource allocations. Thirdly, it is important to seek out the proper resource allocation strategy. Finally, the challenges and conclusions are discussed in this article.
