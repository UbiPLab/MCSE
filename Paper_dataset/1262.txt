AB The fifth generation mobile communication system (5G) will soon become mainstream. This technology enables enhanced network environments with enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC), and massive machine type communications (mMTC), which can be leveraged in creating and providing highly sophisticated digital services. It is important that these services are provided with flexibility in accordance with individual users' unique environments and situations. Fujitsu's Multi-access Edge Cloud realizes an innovative platform that can provide such services in the 5G era. It realizes a distributed network system that makes it easier to provide various digital services through the efficient usage of computing resource deployed over the whole network. Fujitsu conducted a field trial of this multi-access edge cloud in FY2017 using a live commercial network, and verified that it helped to make providing services at the edge of the network (appropriate points where the service requirements can be handled) easier. This paper outlines the features comprising the Fujitsu's Multi-access Edge Cloud that makes it easy to provide diverse 5G-era digital services and describes the major technologies to realize it.
