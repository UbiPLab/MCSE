AB Task scheduling is one of the basic problems in cloud computing. In hybrid cloud, tasks scheduling faces new challenges. In this paper, we propose a GaDE algorithm, based on differential evolution algorithm, to improve single objective scheduling performance of a hybrid cloud. In order to better deal with the multi-objective task scheduling optimisation in hybrid clouds, on the basis of the GaDE and Pareto optimum of quick sorting method, we present a multi-objective algorithm, named NSjDE. This algorithm also makes considerations to reduce the frequency of evaluation. Comparing with experiments of Min-Min algorithm, GaDE algorithm and NSjDE algorithm, results show that for the single object task scheduling, GaDE and NsjDE algorithms perform better in getting the approximate optimal solution. The optimisation speed of multi-objective NSjDE algorithm is faster than the single-objective jDE algorithm, and NSjDE can produce more than one non-dominated solution meeting the requirements, in order to provide more options to the user.
