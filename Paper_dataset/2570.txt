AB The objective of this papers is to measure the reliability of an instrument for the evaluation of the public policies of cloud computing in the Legislative Branch of a brazilian state. A survey was conducted with CIO's through the application of closed questionnaires using Likert scale. The analysis consists of the measurement of internal consistency reliability using Cronbach's Alpha Coefficient. The results were analyzed individually in their categories: capacity building, implementation, infrastructure, model, organizational, public policies and resources. As an exploratory research, results show acceptable levels in the literature only in the individual reliability of two constructs, although the instrument was classified as reliable when considering all variables. From the results of the research, the model can be tested in other realities and after this first step categories may become independent evaluation instruments.
