ID LEARNING-BASED OPTIMIZATION
AB With the rapid development of cloud computing, more and more people shift their workload on cloud data centers, is the energy consumption of virtual machines (VMs) is non-negligible. In order to reduce energy consumption and achieve green cloud service, we propose a novel VM scheduling strategy. All the VMs are divided into two groups: the main group and the reservation group. When the traffic load is light, the reservation group is deactivated and energy will be conserved. Considering that a job is divided into several tasks for parallel processing in multiple VMs, we establish a batch arrival queueing model with multiple VMs. By using Gauss Seidel method, we derive the steady-state distribution of the system model with two-dimensional Markov chain. Moreover, we evaluate the performance measures in terms of the blocking probability of tasks, the average response time of tasks and the energy saving rate of system. We provide numerical experiments with analysis and simulation to validate the proposed strategy and to estimate the influence of system parameters on performance measures. We establish a system cost function to trade off different performance measures, and develop an intelligent searching algorithm to optimize the system parameters.
