AB In the recent decade, the tremendous growth in IT venture had evolved a new term known as Cloud Computing. Cloud computing is the concept of sharing the environment and in turn sharing the infrastructure which may lead to the risk of illicit access of data. As the cloud computing involves sharing of infrastructure, scheduling plays the vital role. Another big challenge is providing Trust to the users in the commercial cloud environments. In the available heterogeneous infrastructure, users tend to opt of the best viable resources only based on the trust. Invasive Weed Optimization (IWO) is a population-based algorithm inspired from the process of weeds colonization and distribution. In this study, it is demonstrated that, with trust modal -IWO performs better results than other techniques.
