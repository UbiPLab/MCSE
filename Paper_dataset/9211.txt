AB Cloud applications involve a set of interconnected software components running on remote virtual machines. The deployment and dynamic reconfiguration of cloud applications, involving the addition/removal of virtual machines and components hosted on these virtual machines, are error-prone tasks. They must preserve the application consistency and respect important architectural invariants related to software dependencies. In this paper, we introduce a protocol for automating these reconfiguration tasks. In order to ensure its correctness and robustness, we implement the protocol with the support of the Maude system for rapid prototyping purposes, and we verify it with its formal analysis tools.
