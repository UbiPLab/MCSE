AB Today, with the rapid increase of urban population, the organization and governance within the city have been completely changed, and the city has become an important force for innovation and economic growth. In the face of the challenges of urbanization, all major cities in the world have nowhere in the economic, cultural, environmental and other fields to enhance the city's competitiveness and create a livable life and pro-business environment to attract talents and capital. The development of cities is increasingly influenced by the concept of a smart eco-city. This study takes Shanghai as a sample and distributes the questionnaire to the general public in Shanghai. The study distributed questionnaires by random sampling. 300 questionnaires were distributed in this study, and 256 valid questionnaires were collected, with a recovery rate of 85%. The results of the study: 1. The most important facet is "smart citizen". The second most important aspects are "smart technology", "smart governance" and "smart environment". 2. The top five indicators that are most valued are: (1) knowledge sharing, accounting for 0.101 of the overall weight; (2) information literacy, accounting for 0.090 of the overall weight; (3) The guidance mechanism accounts for 0.082 of the overall weight; (4) the artificial intelligence application, which accounts for 0.080 of the overall weight; (5) the cloud computing service, which accounts for 0.072 of the overall weight.
