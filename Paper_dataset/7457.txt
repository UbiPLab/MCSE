AB Cloud computing has attracted the attention of educational and research institutions as a way to support modern trends in teaching and learning. This article describes the performance assessment of a private cloud within a university environment using the Web of System Performance (WOSP) model. A survey was carried out to measure the respondents' attitude towards the use of private cloud in which students and experts serve as sample. Testing was conducted by designing a virtual lab consisting of a number of virtual machines operated by a selected sample. The results showed that the usage of cloud computing in university has good perceived system performance judging from how it fares in the constituent parts of the WOSP model. Furthermore, the study revealed that usability and flexibility outperformed criterion like security. Moreover, several non-functional criteria outperformed functionality. In short, the knowledge and results presented from assessing a private cloud using WOSP model could be beneficial for users, designers and managers of private clouds especially in universities.
