ID DATA POSSESSION
AB Heterogeneous sensor systems collect a large amount of sensor data. Because of limited processing capability of sensor nodes, such data are typically stored and processed in a centralized environment in the cloud. However, when data are managed and processed by multiple cloud servers, users do not physically possess these data. The risk of unauthorized access to the cloud data increases dramatically. Therefore, enforcing the integrity of the outsourced data remotely becomes a challenge in the heterogeneous sensor system. Remote data possession auditing is a solution to guarantee the availability and integrity of data outsourced to the cloud. Most existing solutions only target at a single cloud service provider (CSP) environment without considering the multi-cloud scenario. How to audit the data possession among the distributed CSP servers effectively becomes a major concern. In this paper, we propose a parallel cloud data possession checking scheme for the multi-cloud environment. Our approach utilizes the homomorphic verification tag created by the Paillier cryptosystem to support unlimited query challenges and introduces the error-correction encoding method to ensure error localization and data correction. We prototype our solution and analyze the scheme comprehensively. Our evaluation results demonstrate the efficiency and security of our method. It also supports simultaneous verification of multiple CSPs. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
