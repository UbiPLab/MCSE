DE Cloud computing; cloud management; cloud customer
AB Cloud computing is readily being adopted by enterprises due to its following benefits: ability to provide better service to customers, improved flexibility, lower barrier to entry for an enterprise, lower maintenance cost on IT service, availability etc. However, the interaction between cloud service provider and customer is not well-defined yet. Understanding of the service offered while approaching cloud computing paradigm and also understanding of the required actions during the period of receiving a cloud service e.g. provision of new resources, scaling up/down, billing, etc. remains a concern for the enterprises. This paper proposes a segregated interaction model to manage the receiving of a cloud service in a hierarchical way.
