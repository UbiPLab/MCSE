AB A point cloud represents a set of measurement points. Usually it is a group of points in a defined coordinate space without any information how individual points relates to each other. For a simple shapes and objects description additional methods are needed. In this paper we would like to present a new 3D point cloud scanning method for planes detection. Our developed algorithm includes several image processing methods like the connected component labeling and the shape borders detection which allows computing important plane properties end even detect object shapes. The scanning algorithm is described on a testing example and verified on real measured data. The paper concludes by algorithm properties summarization and recommendations where this method can be used. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by IASE.
