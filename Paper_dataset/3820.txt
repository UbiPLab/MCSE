AB Geographically distributed data centers are interconnected through provisioned dedicated WAN links, realized by circuit/wavelength-switching that support large-scale data transfer between data centers. These dedicated WAN links are typically shared by multiple services through on-demand and in-advance resource reservations, resulting in varying bandwidth availability in future time periods. Such an inter-data center network provides a dynamic and virtualized environment when augmented with cloud infrastructure supporting end-host migration. In such an environment, dynamically provisioned network resources are recognized as extremely useful capabilities for many types of network services. However, the existing approaches to in-advance reservation services provide limited reservation capabilities, eg, limited connections over links returned by the traceroute over traditional IP-based networks. Moreover, most existing approaches do not address fault tolerance in the event of node or link failures and do not handle end-host migrations; thus, they do not provide a reliability guarantee for in-advance reservation frameworks. In this paper, we propose using multiple paths to increase bandwidth usage in the WAN links between data centers when a single path does not provide the requested bandwidth. Emulation-based evaluations of the proposed path computation show a higher reservation acceptance rate compared to state-of-art reservation frameworks, and such computed paths can be configured with a limited number of static forwarding rules on switches. Our prototype provides the RESTful Web service interface for link-fail and end-host migration event management and reroutes paths for all the affected reservations.
