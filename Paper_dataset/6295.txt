AB One of the limitations of the 3D digitisation process is that it typically requires highly specialised skills and yields heterogeneous results depending on proprietary software solutions and trial-and-error practices. The main objective of Culture 3D Cloud [L1], a collaborative project funded within the framework of the French "Investissements d'Avenir" programme, is to overcome this limitation, providing the cultural community with a novel image-based modelling service for 3D digitisation of cultural artefacts. This will be achieved by leveraging the widespread expert knowledge of digital photography in the cultural arena to enable cultural heritage practitioners to perform routine 3D digitisation via photo-modelling. Cloud computing was chosen for its capability to offer high computing resources at reasonable cost, scalable storage via continuously growing virtual containers, multi-support diffusion via remote rendering and efficient deployment of releases.
