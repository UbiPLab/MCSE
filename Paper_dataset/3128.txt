AB The transition dipole moments of the SiN radical are calculated by the valence internally contracted multireference configuration interaction (icMRCI) approach with the aug-cc-pV6Z basis set. The transition probabilities of spontaneous emissions are computed between the eight lowest-lying doublet states. The vibrational band origins, Einstein coefficients, and Franck-Condon factors of all the spontaneous emissions involved are evaluated. The rotationless radiative lifetimes of the first 15 vibrational levels were determined to be approximately 10(-3)-10(-5)s long for the A(2)Pi state, 10(-3)-10(-7) s long for the F-2 Pi state, 10(-6)-10(-7) s long for the C-2 Pi state, 10(-6) s long for the D-2 Sigma(-) and E-2 Delta states, and 10(-7) s long for the B-2 Sigma(+) and G(2)Delta states. It is observed that the rotationless radiative lifetimes quickly become shorter, with an increase in the vibrational level for the A(2)Pi and F-2 Pi states. The Einstein coefficients of many emissions are large for the B-2 Sigma(+)-X-2 Sigma(+), B-2 Sigma(+)-A(2)Pi, C-2 Pi-X-2 Sigma(+), C-2 Pi-A(2)Pi, D-2 Sigma(-)-A(2)Pi, E-2 Delta, A(2)Pi, F-2 Pi-X-2 Sigma(+), F-2 Pi-A(2)Pi, and G(2)Delta-A(2)Pi systems. However, the emissions are very weak for the F-2 Pi-D-2 Sigma(-) system. The vibrational levels and rotational constants of each state are determined and the spectral range of each transition system is evaluated. The vibrational band origins are compared with the available experimental ones. The spectroscopic routines for detecting the unobserved states are proposed. These results can be employed to measure emissions, in particular those of interstellar clouds and stellar atmospheres.
