AB Cloud computing-based heterogeneous networks (C-HetNets) have been considered as promising network architecture of future wireless communication systems. However, its performance is constrained by the capability of fronthaul. To study the performance limit of C-HetNets, the coverage performance of the open access strategy in C-HetNets is analyzed in this paper. In particular, the non-ideal condition of fronthaul in C-HetNets is characterized by establishing a stochastic geometry-based model, and a tight lower bound on coverage probability is derived for downlink transmissions. Based on the derived results, the constraint of the fronthaul is given to ensure that open access strategy can achieve the best coverage performance. Finally, the simulation results are provided to verify the theoretical results and show the impact of fronthaul constrains.
