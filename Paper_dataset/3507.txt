AB Fog computing, complementary to cloud computing, has recently emerged as a new paradigm that extends the computing infrastructure from the center to the edge of the network. This article explores the design of a fog computing orchestration framework to support IoT applications. In particular, we focus on how the widely adopted cloud computing orchestration framework can be customized to fog computing systems. We first identify the major challenges in this procedure that arise due to the distinct features of fog computing. Then we discuss the necessary adaptations of the orchestration framework to accommodate these challenges.
