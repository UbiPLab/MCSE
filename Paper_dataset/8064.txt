AB Cloud manufacturing is emerging as a new manufacturing paradigm as well as an integrated technology, which is promising in transforming today's manufacturing industry towards service-oriented, highly collaborative and innovative manufacturing in the future. In order to better understand cloud manufacturing, this paper provides a critical review of relevant concepts and ideas in cloud computing as well as advanced manufacturing technologies that contribute to the evolution of cloud manufacturing. The key characteristics of cloud manufacturing are also presented in order to clarify the cloud manufacturing concept. Furthermore, a four-process structure is proposed to describe the typical scenario in cloud manufacturing, hoping to provide a theoretical reference for practical applications. Finally, an application case of a private cloud manufacturing system for a conglomerate is presented.
