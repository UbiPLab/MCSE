AB Edge computing is an effective paradigm for proximity in computation, but must inexorably face mobility issues and traffic fluctuations. While software orchestration may provide effective service handover between different edge infrastructures, seamless operation with negligible service disruption necessarily requires pre-provisioning and the need to leave some network functions idle for most of the time, which eventually results in large energy waste and poor efficiency. Existing consolidation algorithms are largely ineffective in these conditions because they lack context, i.e., the knowledge of which resources are effectively used and which ones are just provisioned for other purposes (i.e., redundancy, resilience, scaling, migration). Though the concept is rather straightforward, its feasibility in real environments must be demonstrated. Motivated by the lack of energy-efficiency mechanisms in cloud management software, we have developed a set of extensions to OpenStack for power management and Quality of Service, explicitly targeting the introduction of more context for applications. In this paper, we briefly describe the overall architecture and evaluate its efficiency and effectiveness. We analyze performance metrics and their relationship with power consumption, hence extending the analysis to specific aspects that cannot be investigated by software simulations. We also show how the usage of context information can greatly improve the effectiveness of workload consolidation in terms of energy saving.
