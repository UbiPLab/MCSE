AB Healthcare plays an important role in the growth of the country. Today, it is necessary to look after the healthcare sector. There are various technologies like Cloud Computing, Internet of Things, Big Data Analytics, which are working, in the healthcare sector to improve it. Some countries already adopt the cloud-based technologies to improve the healthcare system. The main problem with this cloud-based system is the high delay while store and processing the data. Due to high delay, the patients with the critical condition do not get the response or treatment timely. This may affect the patient will move to the dead state or the doctor will not able to take the right decision. To reduce the delay and response time nobody has proposed the Architecture. Due to heavy workload on cloud data centres, the energy consumption will also be increased. To overcome all these problems an architecture is necessary. In this paper, we are proposing an architecture named as Fog-Cloud based architecture. This architecture will reduce the delay, energy consumption, and the latency. To testbed, we execute one topology or scenario multiple times. The collected results show that our proposal is reducing the delay, energy consumption, and the latency in comparison to cloud only.
