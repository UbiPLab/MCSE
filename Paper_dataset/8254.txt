AB This paper has proposed an integrated healthcare monitoring solution for the soldiers deployed in adverse environmental conditions, using the internet of things (IoT) with distributed computing. For these soldiers, the health parameters of every individual need to be monitored on a real-time basis and subsequent analysis of the dataset to be made for initiating appropriate medical support with the lowest possible delay. In this paper, a three-layer service-oriented IoT architecture has been proposed where the computational functionalities are distributed among all the layers. The proposed distributed computing mechanism has implemented two levels of filtration of redundant information that belongs to safe soldiers. The first level of filtering is done at the end-node using the Fuzzy classification approach and the second level of filtering is done at the intermediate node using the time-series pattern analysis approach. This layer-wise filtration process results in a reduction in data flooding and computational burden on the cloud due to which system response time improves to suit emergency applications. A prototype has been developed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
