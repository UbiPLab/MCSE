AB With the increase in global population and the continuous development of societies and economies, the demand for water and the amount of wastewater produced have been increasing. How to precisely monitor and manage water environments is an important challenge facing countries worldwide. In this paper, we first review and summarize the current development status and main problems facing the construction of smart water environment systems. We then explain key technologies such as big data, the Internet of Things, and cloud computing used in the construction of smart water environments, including their technical principles, applications, and development trends. Finally, we build a smart decision-making system for the precise management of the water environment and propose a general framework for the construction of the system. Through the construction of an Internet of Things and cloud computing platforms, and the simulation of the water quality analysis model, the entire process of real-time monitoring, precise pollution control, and smart management of the water environment are realized. This paper provides a theoretical basis for scientific supervision, applications, and decision-making with regards to water environments.
