AB The expenses in the sustenance of IT investments has become a major ledger item in businesses to the extent that in some cases business priorities had to be changed for sustaining IT systems. Cloud computing, a disruptive technology, is changing the sustenance model with on-demand and metered service approach. However, the adoption of this technology has not been consistent across sectors due to fear on loss of control and changes required in application development and deployment. Authors propose KIET (Knowing, Initiating, Evolving and Transforming) framework based on diffusion theory for adoption of cloud computing in organizations that have strong regulatory framework. Authors implemented the proposed framework on the Indian Banking sector, with majority of the banks being in the public sector. After the implementation of the framework, 49.4% of the banks have adopted cloud computing and another 27.8% of the banks have started the initial steps for adoption.
