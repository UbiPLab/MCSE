AB In this work, we present WEEZARD, a smart, cost-effective system, aimed at producing, managing and analysing high-quality debris-flow simulations to be used in hazard assessments. Developing the system was a challenge because of the complexity and the number of interconnected operations involved in such assessments. The goal was achieved by using a web client-server system, where a set of web services are exposed in a way similar to that used in OGC (R) WPS solutions. The new system is composed of a previously developed advanced two-phase debris-flow model (TRENT2D), re-coded as a web service, and all the functionalities necessary to exploit the model, from the management of input and output (also provided as web services) to GIS features and two-and three-dimensional dynamic visualizations. Future developments include the possibility of using approaches such as the "Model as a Service" to further increase the accessibility and interoperability of the TRENT2D model.
