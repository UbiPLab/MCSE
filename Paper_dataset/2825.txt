ID OPTIMIZATION
AB The current cloud-based Internet-of-Things (IoT) model has revealed great potential in offering storage and computing services to the IoT users. Fog computing, as an emerging paradigm to complement the cloud computing platform, has been proposed to extend the IoT role to the edge of the network. With fog computing, service providers can exchange the control signals with the users for specific task requirements, and offload users' delay-sensitive tasks directly to the widely distributed fog nodes at the network edge, and thus improving user experience. So far, most existing works have focused on either the radio or computational resource allocation in the fog computing. In this work, we investigate a joint radio and computational resource allocation problem to optimize the system performance and improve user satisfaction. Important factors, such as service delay, link quality, mandatory benefit, and so on, are taken into consideration. Instead of the conventional centralized optimization, we propose to use a matching game framework, in particular, student project allocation (SPA) game, to provide a distributed solution for the formulated joint resource allocation problem. The efficient SPA-(S, P) algorithm is implemented to find a stable result for the SPA problem. In addition, the instability caused by the external effect, i.e., the interindependence between matching players, is removed by the proposed user-oriented cooperation (UOC) strategy. The system performance is also further improved by adopting the UOC strategy.
