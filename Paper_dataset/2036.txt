AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify and model critical barriers to cloud computing adoption (CCA) in Indian MSMEs by the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) approach. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, through a literature survey and expert opinions, 14 critical barriers were identified, and the ISM tool was used to establish interrelationship among the identified barriers and to determine the key barriers having high driving power. Findings After analyzing the barriers, it was found that three barriers, namely, lack of confidentiality (B8), lack of top management support (B3) and lack of sharing and collaboration (B2) were most significant. Research limitations/implications The developed model is based on the expert opinions, which may be biased, influencing the final output of the structural model. The research implications of the developed model are to help managers of the organization in the understanding significance of the barriers and to prioritize or eliminate the same for the effective CCA. Originality/value This study is for the first time an attempt that has been made to apply the ISM methodology to explore the interdependencies among the critical barriers for Indian MSMEs. This paper will guide the managers at various levels of an organization for effective implementation of the cloud computing practices.
