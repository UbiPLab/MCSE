AB In the last years, cloud computing has emerged as a new information technology (IT) model. Which provides an easy way for data processing and storage remotely through a network. Nowadays, cloud storage has become an attractive storage scheme for users to store their data. When users store their files remotely in a cloud storage system, they still worried about the security of their files and the guarantee of the confidentiality and the integrity of them. In this work, we propose a multi-agent framework to provide cloud data storage security. The proposed multi-agent framework enables the security of data in cloud storage by providing both integrity and confidentiality of data. For this purpose, we proposed a client-side encryption method, which is based on the use of both AES and RSA algorithms, it provides the confidentiality and privacy of data besides the performance. Proof of retrievability based on the use of hash function is adopted in our multi-agent framework, to enable data integrity check.
