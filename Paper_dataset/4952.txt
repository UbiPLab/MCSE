AB The rapid advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing technologies have significantly promoted the collection and sharing of various data. In order to reduce the communication cost and the storage overhead, it is necessary to exploit data deduplication mechanisms. However, existing data deduplication technologies still suffer security and efficiency drawbacks. In this paper, we propose two secure data deduplication schemes based on Rabin fingerprinting over wireless sensing data in cloud computing. The first scheme is based on deterministic tags and the other one adopts random tags. The proposed schemes realize data deduplication before the data is outsourced to the cloud storage server, and hence both the communication cost and the computation cost are reduced. In particular, variable-size block-level deduplication is enabled based on the technique of Rabin fingerprinting which generates data blocks based on the content of the data. Before outsourcing data to the cloud, users encrypt the data based on convergent encryption technologies, which protects the data from being accessed by unauthorized users. Our security analysis shows that the proposed schemes are secure against offline brute-force dictionary attacks. In addition, the random tag makes the second scheme more reliable. Extensive experimental results indicate that the proposed data deduplication schemes are efficient in terms of the deduplication rate, the system operation time, and the tag generation time.
