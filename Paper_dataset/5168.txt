AB Recently, there are available to build a smart home with advanced telecommunication technologies. We can use several network protocols for interoperability between devices in smart home. Through the ability of devices in smart homes, each device can be intelligent which involves computing, decision making or strategy making functionalities. The functionalities are also able to deploy in servers which may in a cloud. This paper presents a seamless multimedia service mechanism based on content profile using identifiers of users and devices in the smart home. We propose the personal mobility mechanism of multimedia contents in order to support multi-spaces and multi-devices and multi-users for seamless multimedia service. We consider the users, devices, locations and the profile of contents to support a mobility mechanism. The profile of contents are used to synchronize the state of contents on multi-devices for the mobility of users in the smart home. Additionally, we design and implement a seamless multimedia service mechanism with the identifiers of the users and devices, the profile of contents.
