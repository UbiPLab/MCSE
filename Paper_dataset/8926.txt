ID DATA WAREHOUSES
AB Datawarehouses can be extremely large and ressource demanding, which is not always affordable in a local environment. Hence, in order to deal with the big amounts of data held in the datawarehouses, Cloud warehousing seems to be the solution. On the other hand, many entreprises use datawarehouses for data analysis and use XML to deal with semi-structured data but also to take advantage of the web environment. Therefore, the idea of combining the two solutions in a parallel environment seems necessary. Thus, the goal of the study presented in this paper is to use XML to store and exchange data and to connect it to the distributed processing of multidimentional data. This article deals with the problematic of storing documents in distributed environments such as the cloud nodes, and discusses the possibility of combining the storage of data and the decisional analysis based on OLAP cubes in cloud environments, using the MapReduce model for query processing.
