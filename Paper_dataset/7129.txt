AB Cloud computing continues to mature and more applications continue to be deployed in public clouds. Client applications deployed in the cloud should automatically scale up and down to match changing workload demands, though they must be careful to ensure that sufficient resources are provisioned to achieve performance objectives. The cloud provider, on the other hand, attempts to reduce costs by reducing power consumption by consolidating load onto fewer, highly utilized machines. In this work, we introduce an algorithm that integrates both application autoscaling and dynamic virtual machine (VM) allocation into a single algorithm in order to achieve the goals of both cloud provider and client. Further, we consider multi-VM applications, such as multi-tiered web-based applications, and extend the integrated algorithm to take the network topology into account when placing or migrating applications. The goal is to reduce VM-to-VM communication latency; our focus is on trying to contain applications within the same racks. We evaluate our work through simulation, showing that the integrated algorithm can achieve better application performance with a significant reduction in virtual machine live migrations, and the topology-aware extension successfully places applications within a single rack.
