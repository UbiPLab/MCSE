AB Mobile edge computing (MEC) technology migrates the cloud computing platform to the edge of the mobile access network, which reduces the end-to-end delay of mobile service delivery and improves the user experience. However, since the number of the deployed small cell base stations (BSs) is larger than the macro BSs, automatic deployment can be used to control deployment costs. In this paper, we study the adaptive boundary algorithm of indoor small cell BSs and propose a power optimization scheme in self-organizing MEC-based heterogeneous small cell networks. According to the actual environment, the indoor small cell BS can be deployed quickly and flexibly. And the coverage of the small cell BS can be optimized by automatically adjusting the power parameters. Considering the coverage and spectral efficiency of the macro BS and the small cell BS, the performance indicators of the optimization program and results evaluation is proposed. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm and scheme can control the deployment cost and improve the optimization coverage of macro BSs and small cell BSs under the control cost.
