ID VIRTUAL-REALITY
AB With the rapid development of the Internet of Things, cloud computing, and big data, more comprehensive and powerful applications become available. Meanwhile, people pay more attention to higher QoE and QoS in a "terminal-cloud" integrated system. Specifically, both advanced terminal technologies (e.g., smart clothing) and advanced cloud technologies (e.g., big data analytics and cognitive computing in clouds) are expected to provide people with more reliable and intelligent services. Therefore, in this article we propose a Wearable 2.0 healthcare system to improve QoE and QoS of the next generation healthcare system. In the proposed system, washable smart clothing, which consists of sensors, electrodes, and wires, is the critical component to collect users' physiological data and receive the analysis results of users' health and emotional status provided by cloud-based machine intelligence.
