AB The fact that cloud computing services have been proposed in recent years, organizations and individuals face with various challenges and problems such as how to migrate applications and software platforms into cloud or how to ensure security of migrated applications. This study reviews the current challenges and open issues in cloud computing, with the focus on autonomic resource management especially in federated clouds. In addition, this study provides recommendations and research roadmaps for scientific activities, as well as potential improvements in federated cloud computing. This survey study covers results achieved through 190 literatures including books, journal and conference papers, industrial reports, forums, and project reports. A solution is proposed for autonomic resource management in the federated clouds, using machine learning and statistical analysis in order to provide better and efficient resource management.
