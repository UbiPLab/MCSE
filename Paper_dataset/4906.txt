AB Distributed storage has been widely used by enterprises in big data and cloud computing. However, the open nature of distributed storage and the geographical restrictions have constrained distributed storage development. People have put forward higher requirements on the security of node data, especially focusing on confidentiality, recoverability, and integrity. In this paper, we find that there are four security vulnerabilities in AONT-RS and RAONT-RS. In addition, we propose an improved AONT called SAONT in which a canary is not used. After that, we present a secure and efficient distributed storage scheme called SAONT-RS based on SAONT and erasure coding. Finally, the security analysis is given from the four aspects of confidentiality, recoverability, integrity, and anti-short plaintext attack. The experiments show that SAONT-RS has high security and efficiency of node data in distributed storage.
