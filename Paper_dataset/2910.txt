AB The problem of joint radio and cloud resources allocation is studied for heterogeneous mobile cloud computing networks. The objective of the proposed joint resource allocation schemes is to maximize the total utility of users as well as satisfy the required quality of service (QoS) such as the end-to-end response latency experienced by each user. We formulate the problem of joint resource allocation as a combinatorial optimization problem. Three evolutionary approaches are considered to solve the problem: genetic algorithm (GA), ant colony optimization with genetic algorithm (ACO-GA), and quantum genetic algorithm (QGA). To decrease the time complexity, we propose a mapping process between the resource allocation matrix and the chromosome of GA, ACO-GA, and QGA, search the available radio and cloud resource pairs based on the resource availability matrixes for ACO-GA, and encode the difference value between the allocated resources and the minimum resource requirement for QGA. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed methods greatly outperform the existing algorithms in terms of running time, the accuracy of final results, the total utility, resource utilization and the end-to-end response latency guaranteeing.
