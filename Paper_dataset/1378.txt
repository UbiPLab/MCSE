AB The modern organizations are equipping themselves with modern current regime of online application infrastructures through cloud, fog, and edge computing. In the presence of several opportunities, the selection criterion for such Internet-based services becomes vital, especially, when there is no supporting information available. Existing recommender systems provide services by evaluating the quality of service parameters, k-mean clustering, and fuzzy logic techniques on customer's feedback. However, these schemes typically rely on customers' feedback and do not provide any information on the interrelationship between the services. Feedback may be self-generated or biased and leading to improper recommendation to service seekers. To resolve the issue, we propose an innovative service association factor method that calculates the value of interrelationships among services appearing together as a package. This technique is implemented based on an intelligent agent that evaluates the values of the associations on standards and quality attributes. It enables the users to select the best services on their preferences. The proposed agent works on fog environment near to the customers. The technique is tested on leading cloud vendors. The results show that the system meets the desires of service seekers in all service models in an efficient manner.
