AB Due to the advancement of cloud computing, mobile technologies are growing at a very high pace since cloud platforms provide their own resources to meet the needs of mobile users. However, the combination of cloud computing and mobile computing is created not only to consume remote services, extend the capabilities of mobile devices or profit from all the massive advantages of the cloud computing, but also to enable mobile users to exploit context information provided by their smartphones. Hence, context-aware systems offer entirely new opportunities for mobile cloud applications by means of collecting mobile users' context data and adopting cloud services' behaviors accordingly. In the previous paper [1], we introduced the detailed architecture for a middleware system, which can define a new interaction between a mobile client and different cloud providers. The current paper is an extension of the earlier one describing an improved version of the proposed middleware, which exploits available cloud resources as well as mobile users' locations to better finding effective mechanisms to consume the right and light cloud services. We conduct experiments using cloudAnalyst to prove the feasibility of our proposed architecture.
