AB The object detection algorithm based on vehicle-mounted lidar is a key component of the perception system on autonomous vehicles. It can provide high-precision and highly robust obstacle information for the safe driving of autonomous vehicles. However, most algorithms are often based on a large amount of point cloud data, which makes real-time detection difficult. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a 3D fast object detection method based on three main steps: First, the ground segmentation by discriminant image (GSDI) method is used to convert point cloud data into discriminant images for ground points segmentation, which avoids the direct computing of the point cloud data and improves the efficiency of ground points segmentation. Second, the image detector is used to generate the region of interest of the three-dimensional object, which effectively narrows the search range. Finally, the dynamic distance threshold clustering (DDTC) method is designed for different density of the point cloud data, which improves the detection effect of long-distance objects and avoids the over-segmentation phenomenon generated by the traditional algorithm. Experiments have showed that this algorithm can meet the real-time requirements of autonomous driving while maintaining high accuracy.
