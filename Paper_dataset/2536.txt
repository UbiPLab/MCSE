AB Personalized healthcare systems deliver e-health services to fulfill the medical and assistive needs of the aging population. Internet of Things (IoT) is a significant advancement in the Big Data era, which supports many real-time engineering applications through enhanced services. Analytics over data streams from IoT has become a source of user data for the healthcare systems to discover new information, predict early detection, and makes decision over the critical situation for the improvement of the quality of life. In this paper, we have made a detailed study on the recent emerging technologies in the personalized healthcare systems with the focus towards cloud computing, fog computing, Big Data analytics, IoT and mobile based applications. We have analyzed the challenges in designing a better healthcare system to make early detection and diagnosis of diseases and discussed the possible solutions while providing e-health services in secure manner. This paper poses a light on the rapidly growing needs of the better healthcare systems in real-time and provides possible future work guidelines.
