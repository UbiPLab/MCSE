AB In Phase III of the North American Forest Dynamics (NAFD) study an automatic workflow has been developed for evaluating forest disturbance history using Landsat observations. It has four major components: an automated approach for image selection and preprocessing, the vegetation change tracker (VCT) forest disturbance analysis, postprocessing, and validation. This approach has been applied to the conterminous US (CONUS) to produce a comprehensive analysis of US forest disturbance history using the NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) cloud computing system. The resultant NAFD-NEX product includes 25 annual forest disturbance maps for 1986-2010 and two time-integrated maps to provide spatial-temporal synoptic view of disturbances over this time period. These maps were derived based on 24,000 + scenes selected from 350,000 + available Landsat images at 30-m resolution, and were validated using a visual assessment of Landsat time-series images in combination with high resolution and other ancillary data sources over samples selected using a probability based sampling method. The validation revealed no major biases in the NAFD-NEX maps for disturbance events that resulted in at least 20% canopy cover loss. The average user's and producer's accuracies for the disturbance class were 53.6% and 53.3%, respectively, with the individual year's user's accuracy varying from 42.8% to 73.6% and producer's accuracy from 39.0% to 84.8% over the 25-year period. The NAFD-NEX disturbance maps are available from a web portal of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center (ORNL-DAAC).
