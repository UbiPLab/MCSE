AB Due to the recent developments in mobile network technology and the supply of mobile devices, services that require high computing power and fast access speed, such as machine learning and multimedia streaming, are attracting attention. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has emerged. MEC allows servers to be located close to users to efficiently handle these services and provides users with ultra-low latency content delivery and powerful computing services. However, there has been a lack of research into the architecture required to efficiently use the computing power and resources of MEC. So, this paper proposes hierarchical MEC architecture in which MEC servers (MECS) are arranged in a hierarchical scheme to provide users with rapid content delivery, high computing performance, and efficient use of server resources.
