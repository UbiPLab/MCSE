AB In the scenario of mobile fog computing (MFC), communication between vehicles and fog layer, which is called vehicle-to-fog (V2F) communication, needs to use bandwidth resources as much as possible with low delay and high tolerance for errors. In order to adapt to these harsh scenarios, there are important technical challenges concerning the combination of network coding (NC) and multipath transmission to construct high-quality V2F communication for cloud-aware MFC. Most NC schemes exhibit poor reliability in burst errors that often occur in high-speed movement scenarios. These can be improved by using interleaving technology. However, most traditional interleaving schemes for multipath transmission are designed based on round robin (RR) or weighted round robin (WRR), in practice, which can waste a lot of bandwidth resources. In order to solve those problems, this paper proposes a novel multipath transmission scheme for cloud-aware MFC, which is called Bidirectional Selection Scheduling (BSS) scheme. Under the premise of realizing interleaving, since BSS can be used in conjunction with a lot of path scheduling algorithms based on Earliest Delivery Path First (EDPF), it can make better use of bandwidth resources. As a result, BSS has high reliability and bandwidth utilization in harsh scenarios. It can meet the high-quality requirements of cloud-aware MFC for transmission.
