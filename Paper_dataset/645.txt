AB Health management engineering can achieve health assessment, prediction and maintenance for maritime communication system to give power maritime communication ability. Basing system health management theory, health management architecture consisting of data acquisition, health assessment, fault diagnosis, intelligent decision and interface system is set up and then a comprehensive with whole-process and all-members health engineering is illustrated. Introducing cloud computing and Internet of things, smart health management is presented. Taking Internet of things as fundamental structure and cloud computing as platform architecture, the frame of smart health management for maritime communication system is formed. Thus, the smart health management framework is built with hierarchical application structure according to health requirement and business of maritime communication system. Two parts, cloud client and cloud platform are involved in the framework. Cloud client is both the user and provider of health services while cloud platform can manage and schedule cloud resources uniformity. An application instance with typical case is present last to explain the framework built. The purpose of the research in this paper is to translate technology and resources in smart health management system into maritime Communication benefits.
