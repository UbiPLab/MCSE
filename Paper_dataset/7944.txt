AB With the rapid advance of mobile computing, cloud computing and wireless network, there is a significant increasing number of mobile subscriptions. This brings new business requirements and demands in mobile testing service, and causes new issues and challenges. In this paper, informative discussions about cloud-based mobile testing-as-a-service (mobile TaaS) are offered, including the essential concepts, focuses, test process, and the expected testing infrastructures. To address the need of infrastructure level service for mobile TaaS, this paper presents a developed system known as MTaaS to provide an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) for mobile testing, in order to indicate the feasibility and effectiveness of cloud-based mobile testing service. In addition, the paper presents a comparison among cloud-based mobile TaaS approaches and several best practices in industry are discussed. Finally, the primary issues, challenges, and needs existed in current mobile TaaS are analyzed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
