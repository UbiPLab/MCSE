AB Hydro-meteorological hazards have an immense effect on this planet throughout the history of disasters from prehistoric to recent times. Despite numerous studies on hydro-meteorological hazards, however, little attention has been paid to the role of ICT in the management of these hazards. Emerging techniques of ICT (Information and Communication Technology) have encouraged the researchers to incorporate these techniques for managing hydro-meteorological hazards. Through a scientometric analysis of the bibliographic data retrieved from Scopus for 2010 to 2019 observation period, this study reveals the pattern of research on hydro-meteorological hazards and the role of various information and communication technologies in the management of these hazards worldwide. This study provides a framework for visualizing the growth of publications, role of ICT in hazards management, citation pattern, countries collaboration and most influential countries, journals and articles. The further analysis evaluates the prominent authors in each category and co-occurrence of key research areas. The results of research outputs show that remote sensing, GIS & artificial intelligence are rapidly grown technologies in the field of hydro-meteorological hazard management over the last 10 years. Since 2013 IoT, cloud computing & big data are emerging technologies in this domain. This scientometric study provides directions for future research in ICT assisted hydro-meteorological hazard management.
