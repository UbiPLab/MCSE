AB Cloud computing has emerged as a high-performance computing environment with a large pool of abstracted, virtualized, flexible, and on-demand resources and services. Scheduling of scientific workflows in a distributed environment is a well-known NP-complete problem and therefore intractable with exact solutions. It becomes even more challenging in the cloud computing platform due to its dynamic and heterogeneous nature. The aim of this study is to optimize multi-objective scheduling of scientific workflows in a cloud computing environment based on the proposed metaheuristic-based algorithm, Hybrid Bio-inspired Metaheuristic for Multi-objective Optimization (HBMMO). The strong global exploration ability of the nature-inspired metaheuristic Symbiotic Organisms Search (SOS) is enhanced by involving an efficient list-scheduling heuristic, Predict Earliest Finish Time (PEFT), in the proposed algorithm to obtain better convergence and diversity of the approximate Pareto front in terms of reduced makespan, minimized cost, and efficient load balance of the Virtual Machines (VMs). The experiments using different scientific workflow applications highlight the effectiveness, practicality, and better performance of the proposed algorithm.
