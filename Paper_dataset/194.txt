AB To increase the protection level of copyright in cloud computing environment, aiming at the problems that the indicators in the copyright protection evaluation system are difficult to accurately define and cannot be quantified, a comprehensive evaluation model of copyright protection based on the combination of analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is proposed. First, using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), the copyright protection evaluation system is constructed and the weight of each evaluation index is determined through the judgment matrix. Then the quantitative evaluation result is fuzzy operated through index weight and evaluated data. Finally, the simulation evaluation results on specific example show that this model is reasonable and effective, and it can provide the evaluation basis and practical reference for copyright protection evaluation in cloud computing environment.
