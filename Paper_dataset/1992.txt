ID OPTIMIZATION
AB In recent years, service-based applications are deemed to be one of the new solutions to build an enterprise application system. In order to answer the most demanding needs or adaptations to the needs of changed services quickly, service composition is currently used to exploit the multi-service capabilities in the Information Technology organizations. While web services, which have been independently developed, may not always be compatible with each other, the selection of optimal services and composition of these services are seen as a challenging issue. In this paper, we present cuckoo search algorithm for web service composition problem which is called CSA-WSC' that provides web service composition to improve the quality of service (QoS) in the distributed cloud environment. The experimental results indicate that the CSA-WSC compared to genetic search skyline network (GS-S-Net) and genetic particle swarm optimization algorithm (GAPSO-WSC) reduces the costs by 7% and responding time by 6%, as two major reasons for the reduction of improvement of the quality of service. It also increases provider availability up to 7.25% and the reliability to 5.5%, as the two important QoS criteria for improving the quality of service.
