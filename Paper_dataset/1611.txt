AB Cloud computing is a prominently distributed paradigm that offers a wide variety of infrastructure, platform, and software services over the internet on demand. However, the identification of trustworthy cloud services imposes difficulties due to the multiplicity and the resemblance in their functionality. The shortage of proficient trust management schemes for services prevents the large-scale adoption of cloud computing paradigm by the public. In this paper, we propose trust management middleware (TMM), a framework for trustworthy service selection in the cloud. TMM performs service selection by integrating subjective assessment from users and objective assessment from service monitors. We proposed a new covariance based algorithm to determine the credibility of user feedback. Also, in our model, a novel objective trust evaluation algorithm is proposed based on prioritization of quality of service parameters depending on the user preferences. The results show that the proposed framework improves the accuracy of trust evaluation considerably and is more efficient in identifying trustworthy cloud services as compared with the other relevant methods.
