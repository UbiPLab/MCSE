AB The edge computing paradigm comes with a promise of lower application latency compared to the cloud. Moreover, offloading user device computations to the edge enables running demanding applications on resource-constrained mobile end devices. However, there is a lack of workload models specific to edge offloading using applications as their basis.In this work, we build upon the reconfigurable open-source mixed reality (MR) framework MR-Leo as a vehicle to study resource utilisation and quality of service for a time-critical mobile application that would have to rely on the edge to be widely deployed. We perform experiments to aid estimating the resource footprint and the generated load by MR-Leo, and propose an application model and a statistical workload model for it. The idea is that such empirically-driven models can be the basis of evaluations of edge algorithms within simulation or analytical studies.A comparison with a workload model used in a recent work shows that the computational demand of MR-Leo exhibits very different characteristics from those assumed for MR applications earlier.
