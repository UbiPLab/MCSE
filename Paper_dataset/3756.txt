AB There is a strong industrial drive to use cloud computing technologies and concepts for providing timing sensitive services in the networking domain since it would provide the means to share the physical resources among multiple users and thus increase the elasticity and reduce the costs. In this work, we develop a mathematical model for user-stateless virtual network functions forming a forwarding graph. The model captures uncertainties of the performance of these virtual resources as well as the time-overhead needed to instantiate them. The model is used to derive a service controller for horizontal scaling of the virtual resources as well as an admission controller that guarantees that packets exiting the forwarding graph meet their end-to-end deadline. The Automatic Service and Admission Controller (AutoSAC) developed in this work uses feedback and feedforward making it robust against uncertainties of the underlying infrastructure. Also, it has a fast reaction time to changes in the input.
