AB The DRM(digital rights management) techniques have been rapidly developed to protect the digital media contents. The growth of smart device and cloud computing makes the environment in which various services can be provided anywhere and anytime, so the DRM technologies have to react to such changes. From this aspect, we previously proposed the architecture of DRM-as-a-Service that provides various functionalities of DRM as some services on the cloud environment, and we referred to it as the DRM Cloud. In this paper, we define a reference model of DRM Cloud to represent some DRM functions that are provided by the DRM Cloud, and several service scenarios are proposed on the DRM Cloud. Also we simulate the DRM Cloud on the testbed and then discuss some security issues and how to handle the interoperability in the DRM Cloud. We conclude that the DRM Cloud allows the content consumers to use many contents with various smart devices, also let the DRM developers and the content service providers reduce the costs of development and business.
