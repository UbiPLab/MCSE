AB In a secure data sharing system, the keyword search over encrypted files is a basic need of a user with appropriate privileges. Although the traditional searchable encryption technique can provide the privacy protection, two critical issues still should be considered. Firstly, a cloud server may be selfish in order to save its computing resources, and thus returns only a fragment of results to reply a search query. Moreover, since different keys are always used for different document sets, making a search query over massive sets and verifying the search results are both impractical for a user with massive keys. In this paper, we propose a scheme named "verifiable searchable encryption with aggregate keys". In the scheme, a data owner need only distribute a single aggregate key to other users to selectively share both search and verification privileges over his/her document sets. After obtaining such a key, a user can use it not only for generating a single trapdoor as a keyword search query, but for verifying whether the server just conducts a part of computing for the search request. Then, we give an advance scheme under the multi owner setting. Finally, our analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate that the scheme are both practical and secure.
