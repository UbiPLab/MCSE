AB Water plays a vital role for the survival of life. We get water in different forms of precipitation and rain is the most beneficial of all types. The demand for water is very high throughout the Pakistan, especially where we have limited natural water resources. Summer monsoon season has profound impact in reducing water scarcity in Pakistan. Heavy rainfall results into floods whereas less rainfall creates drought which not only affects the economy but also puts human life in risk. The aim of this research is to manage the movement of clouds from heavy rainfall areas to those areas where there is paucity of water, through satellite using electromagnetic waves. To accommodate such a sensitive satellite data which is paramount to a country, it is required to have some special systems based on quantum mechanics that are more efficient and pregnable than conventional computers. The consequences will be very high of not securing weather management system, implies to country level disasters. In this paper we first discuss the technology behind quantum computer then proposed a secure architecture by employing quantum computers to ensure the security of data transmission for weather management system.
