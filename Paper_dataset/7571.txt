AB Currently, over nine billion things are connected in the Internet of Things (IoT). This number is expected to exceed 20 billion in the near future, and the number of things is quickly increasing, indicating that numerous data will be generated. It is necessary to build an infrastructure to manage the connected things. Cloud computing (CC) has become important in terms of analysis and data storage for IoT. In this paper, we consider a cloud broker, which is an intermediary in the infrastructure that manages the connected things in CC. We study an optimization problem for maximizing the profit of the broker while minimizing the response time of the request and the energy consumption. A multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) is proposed to solve the problem. The performance of the proposed MOPSO is compared with that of a genetic algorithm and a random search algorithm. The results show that the MOPSO outperforms a well-known genetic algorithm for multiobjective optimization.
