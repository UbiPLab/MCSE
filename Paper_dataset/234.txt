AB Fog computing is a new promising paradigm that is capable of addressing the problems with the traditional cloud computing. However, prior to the development of this qualifiedly roseate technology, security and privacy issues must be addressed since fog servers may be used to process, manage, and store private and latency-sensitive information. One of such measures is to implement a trust management system. The trustworthiness of a node (or trustee) is assessed based on some criteria as determined by the trustor. It is therefore exigent to identify and prioritize these criteria to allow a trustor to determine the extent to which a parameter contributes to the overall trust value of a trustee and whether it is profitable to transact with the node. The prioritization of trust parameter is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem since it involves different criteria which must be considered concurrently. In this study, a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (Fuzzy-AHP) technique is utilized to identify and prioritize trust parameters in fog computing. The results indicate that quality of service (QoS) is the best prioritized parameter that a service requester can use to evaluate the trust level of a service provider, followed by quality of security (QoSec) while recommendations is the worst ranked. It is also revealed that social relationships is the most ranked trust parameter that a service provider can use to determine the level of truthfulness of a service requester while past reputation is the least considered. This study further considers the sub-criteria under each category with a view to prioritizing them using the Fuzzy-AHP method. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
