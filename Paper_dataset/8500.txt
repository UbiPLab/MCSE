AB Previous studies on the new information technology focused on the system development and could computing in health care. However, with rapid development of information systems, discussion on the cloud computing for health management should not be centered merely on technological perspectives, since technologies continuously evolve and will reach maturity in the end. In contrast, enhancing the usage of cloud computing requires everlasting efforts. Moreover, prior studies ignored the influence of social interaction on behaviors because of the limited research methodology. In fact, however, social influence plays an important role in determining users' intention to use the cloud computing for health management. This study explores factors that influence the intention to use cloud sphygmomanometer. It extends the technology acceptance model (TAM) with social network analysis. The research data was collected from 50 Health+ cloud sphygmomanometer users. They all were nurses of surgical wards in a medical center in northern Taiwan. Results showed that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and social influence affect behavioral intention to use cloud sphygmomanometer. Besides, perceived ease of use and social influence positively influence perceived usefulness of cloud sphygmomanometer. Peers are helpful in motivating medical staff to use the cloud sphygmomanometer. If the medical practitioners are willing to use the cloud sphygmomanometer, they will likely to recommend others to use it.
