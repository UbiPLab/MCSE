AB Security has always been a major concern in the cloud environment because outsourcing leads to the new security issues. Privacy risks related to the job assignment are the dominating hurdles in the wide organizations like research, military and intelligence. To address this issue Garbled Role-Based Access Control (GRBAC) mechanism is being offered in this paper having key component that obliviously assign roles to the users through (RSA Oblivious-Transfer). The design of the proposed model has been guided by the Role-Based Access Control and Dynamic Separation of Duty. The proposed model also includes the flexible authentication based on the user's context information. GRBAC offers fine-grained security while algorithm does not have to be secret from adversary. Security of this model is based on the adopted Garbled Function (). The proposed model is best suited for the organizations where available roles cannot be revealed to the users and assigned roles are not to be leaked even to the server.
