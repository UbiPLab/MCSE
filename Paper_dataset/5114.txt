AB Sensor cloud is the combination of wireless sensor networks and Cloud computing which performs real-time data acquisition and processing in a distributed environment. The infrastructure enables collection, processing, sharing, visualisation, archival and searching of large amounts of sensor data. It makes it possible for sharing computing resources and data, on an unprecedented scale, among an infinite number of geographically distributed groups. The paper provides an implementation of efficient web based technology for processing large, heterogeneous set of data based on Open Geospatial Consortium Standards. The proposed interface uses the sensor cloud middleware and wireless sensors for distributed applications that process large amounts of data. Sensor cloud middleware in the proposed work uses Open Stack and Hadoop framework along with utilities like generic modelling environment, HBase and Zabbix. The user interface with features such as viewing sensor data, scheduling sensors for data collection and alerting users have also been discussed.
