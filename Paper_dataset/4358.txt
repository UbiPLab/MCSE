AB This paper studies resource scheduling for wireless small cloud assuming that the execution of an application is modeled as a workflow graph. A scheduling method is proposed which consists of two parts. For the task-to-computing-unit assignment part which operates on the long-term time-scale, the solution is to partition the workflow into task groups which have loose data transfer constraint and each task group is assigned to the computing unit which can finish executing the task group at the earliest time. For the computing and wireless communication resource scheduling part which operates on the short-term time-scale, we simply use the round-robin principle. A part by part delay component estimation method is presented based on which the average delay performance can be analyzed. Simulation results validate the theoretical analysis and show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods. The impact of different parameter settings on the system performance is also investigated.
