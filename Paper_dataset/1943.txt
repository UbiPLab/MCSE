AB The scalability feature of cloud computing attracts application service providers (ASPs) to use cloud application hosting. In cloud environments, resources can be dynamically provisioned on demand for ASPs. Autonomic resource provisioning for the purpose of preventing resources over-provisioning or under-provisioning is a widely investigated topic in cloud environments. There has been proposed a lot of resource-aware and/or service-level agreement (SLA)-aware solutions to handle this problem. However, intelligence solutions such as exploring the hidden knowledge on the Web users' behavior are more effective in cost efficiency. Most importantly, with considering cloud service diversity, solutions should be flexible and customizable to fulfill ASPs' requirements. Therefore, lack of a flexible resource provisioning mechanism is strongly felt. In this paper, we proposed an autonomic resource provisioning mechanism with resource-aware, SLA-aware, and user behavior-aware features, which is called three-dimensional mechanism. The proposed mechanism used radial basis function neural network in order to provide providence and flexibility features. The experimental results showed that the proposed mechanism reduces the cost while guarantees the quality of service.
