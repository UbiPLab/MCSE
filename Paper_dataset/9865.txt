AB Recently, Cloud computing has created new dimensions for computing. The process of providing service - enabled connection is considered to be the most important function of clouds. This paper which we have carefully thought about, takes into consideration dynamic capacity planning for cloud systems. The objective is to dynamically accommodate computing capacity in order to meet Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and, in addition, to minimize the total costs incurred in the cloud services. In this paper, we propose an improvement of a capacity planning scheme to make sure that perfect performance targets of SLAs are always met. The scheme employs threshold-based techniques to guarantee that the SLAs are met and the run-up costs are created to operate on cloud environments and thus has to deal with these environments specific obstacles.
