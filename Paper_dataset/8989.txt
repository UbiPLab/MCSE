AB This study aims to evaluate the adoption of Cloud Computing in Saudi university hospitals and to investigate the factors that impact the adoption. This study integrates the Technological, Organizational, Environmental (TOE) framework and the Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theory, and adds the decision maker context to the original model. The study sample included Saudi university hospitals in Riyadh city. The data were collected using semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire. The result of this study determines the five most significant factors influencing the adoption of cloud computing in Saudi university hospitals, which are in sequence: Relative advantage, Decision-maker's innovativeness, Decision-maker's knowledge in IT, Compatibility, and Top management support. Moreover, among the four different contexts, the most important context is the Decision-maker context, followed by the Technological context, then the Organizational context, and finally the Environmental context. The findings are beneficial for hospitals to guide them to make better decisions regarding cloud computing adoption. Scholars can use this study to gain a more holistic understanding of cloud computing adoption and apply new theories in this field.
