AB This paper focuses on energy consumption which is a major problem in the dark silicon era. As energy consumption becomes a key issue for operation and maintenance of cloud data centers, cloud computing providers are becoming significantly concerned. Here, we show how spin-transfer torque random access memory (STT-RAM) can be used as an on-chip L2 cache to obtain lower energy compared to conventional L2 caches, like SRAM. High density, fast read access and non-volatility make STT-RAM a significant technology for on-chip memories. Previous studies have mainly studied specific schemes based on common applications and do not provide a thorough analysis of emerging scale-out applications with multiple design options. Here, we discuss different outlooks consisting of performance and energy efficiency in cloud processors by running emerging scale-out workloads. Experiment results on the CloudSuite benchmarks show that the proposed method reduces energy by 51% (on average) and improves energy delay product by 37% (on average) where instruction per cycle degradation is only 22% (on average) compared to the SRAM method.
