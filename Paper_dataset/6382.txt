AB This study aims to employ technology-function based patent analysis to identify the important technologies of cloud computing. This study exploits the Stanford parser and association rule to extract and separate the information concerning technologies and functions from patent text. Based on the results of the technology-function matrix, this study employs technology network analysis to investigate technology change. Moreover, this study proposes a technology-function matrix analysis diagram (TFMAD) and applies the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution to identify the most important technologies of cloud computing. Among the three classes of cloud computing, infrastructure as a service has the largest number of patents and the connections between patents are close, but the platform as a service has the highest patent growth rate. Based on the analysis of TFMAD, this study shows that technological developments related to computing device and virtual machines are of particular importance to the cloud computing industry.
