AB The possibility of performing complex data analysis through sets of cooperating personal smart devices has recently encouraged the definition of new distributed computing paradigms. The general idea behind these approaches is to move early analysis towards theedgeof the network, while relying on other intermediate (fog) or remote (cloud) devices for computations of increasing complexity. Unfortunately, because both of their distributed nature and high degree of modularity, edge-fog-cloud computing systems are particularly prone to cyber security attacks that can be performed against every element of the infrastructure. In order to address this issue, in this paper we present SMCP, a Secure Mobile Crowdsensing Protocol for fog-based applications that exploit lightweight encryption techniques that are particularly suited for low-power mobile edge devices. In order to assess the performance of the proposed security mechanisms, we consider as case study a distributed human activity recognition scenario in which machine learning algorithms are performed by users' personal smart devices at the edge and fog layers. The functionalities provided by SMCP have been directly compared with two state-of-the-art security protocols. Results show that our approach allows to achieve a higher degree of security while maintaining a low computational cost.
