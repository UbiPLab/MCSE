AB Knowledge and competence management in companies focus on resources allocation to business activities, knowledge management approaches promise a positive impact on cost structures. Moreover, with cloud computing and multi-agent systems, we can have a positive impact on business process construction. In fact, cloud computing gives us the ability to perceive resources such as unlimited computer resources. Meanwhile, multi-agent systems provide some degree of independence to achieve specific goals. Nowadays, on the web we can find a significant number of services that provide the same functionality. Hence, business process construction by reusing these services has become a challenging problem. The solution proposed in this paper, can be considerate as an enterprise solution to construct a business process using some competence and knowledge management aspects. Furthermore, the solution is based on cloud computing and agents to discover similar services and classify services according to their similarity degrees and their quality of services.
