AB Over the last decade, a significant amount of effort has been invested on architecting agile and adaptive management solutions in support of autonomic, self-managing networks. Autonomic networking calls for automated decisions for management actions. This can be realized through a set of pre-defined network management policies engineered from human expert knowledge. However, engineering sufficiently accurate knowledge considering the high complexity of today's networking environment is a difficult task. This has been a particularly limiting factor in the practical deployment of autonomic systems. ML is a powerful technique for extracting knowledge from data. However, there has been little evidence of its application in realizing practical management solutions for autonomic networks. Recent advances in network softwarization and programmability through SDN and NFV, the proliferation of new sources of data, and the availability of lowcost and seemingly infinite storage and compute resource from the cloud are paving the way for the adoption of ML to realize cognitive network management in support of autonomic networking. This article is intended to stimulate thought and foster discussion on how to defeat the bottlenecks that are limiting the wide deployment of autonomic systems, and the role that ML can play in this regard.
