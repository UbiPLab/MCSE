AB Data security in the cloud continues to be a huge concern. The adoption of cloud services continues to increase with more businesses transitioning from on premise technology infrastructures to outsourcing cloud-based infrastructures. As the cloud becomes more popular, users are increasingly demanding control over critical security elements of the data and technology assets that are in the cloud. In addition, there are still cries for greater data and security in the cloud. The goal of this paper is to provide cloud service users with greater control over data security in the cloud while at the same time optimizing overall security in the multi-tenant cloud computing environment. This paper introduces cloud-based intelligent agents that are configurable by the users and are expected to give greater compliance for data security in any of the cloud service models.
