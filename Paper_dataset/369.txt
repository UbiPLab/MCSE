AB Cloud computing already raises numerous security questions related to outsourced data confidentiality. Several companies are starting to require the reversibility of their cloud computing. They want to redirect their information systems to another provider or backsourcing their activities. Cloud computing reversibility is considered to be one of the first obstacles to service development; however, few researches have been conducted on this field. We propose characterizing the reversibility of cloud computing using a deductive approach. We suggest ten research hypotheses that identify the guarantees, objectives and process of reversibility. This research is based on a three-lap Delphi method, supported by 18 experts working on cloud computing projects. This article contributes to characterizing cloud computing reversibility and parametric theorization through a new coefficient of concordance proposal. This indicator helps to assess the experts' agreement to or rejection of a hypothesis.
