AB We present an extended version of the two-phase gas-grain code nautilus to the three-phase modelling of gas and grain chemistry of cold cores. In this model, both the mantle and the surface are considered as chemically active. We also take into account the competition among reaction, diffusion and evaporation. The model predictions are confronted to ice observations in the envelope of low-mass and massive young stellar objects as well as towards background stars. Modelled gas-phase abundances are compared to species observed towards TMC-1 (CP) and L134N dark clouds. We find that our model successfully reproduces the observed ice species. It is found that the reaction-diffusion competition strongly enhances reactions with barriers and more specifically reactions with H-2, which is abundant on grains. This finding highlights the importance having a good approach to determine the abundance of H-2 on grains. Consequently, it is found that the major N-bearing species on grains go from NH3 to N-2 and HCN when the reaction-diffusion competition is taken into account. In the gas phase and before a few 10(5) yr, we find that the three-phase model does not have a strong impact on the observed species compared to the two-phase model. After this time, the computed abundances dramatically decrease due to the strong accretion on dust, which is not counterbalanced by the desorption less efficient than in the two-phase model. This strongly constrains the chemical age of cold cores to be of the order of few 10(5) yr.
