AB The use of cloud computing in the educational sector is still in its evolving stage in countries like South Africa. The readiness for cloud computing in South Africa has already gained momentum, but not many researchers are looking into the quantitative exploration of students' experience in the Cloud even though these cloud technologies are perceived to expand the educational sector through distance learning and data exchange among students. The slow uptake seems to lie with data security. In this paper, the authors investigated the use of cloud services in higher education institutions considering students' experiences. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used for Likert scale construction and analysis. The results showed that over 65% of participants had problems with the usage of virtual labs due to lack of skills and 89% of participants could learn more through practical experience. However, the IT skill level of students may not determine their outcomes in module tasks while using cloud technologies. A strong significant relationship between perceived ease of use and perceived value of cloud technologies proved that the measure of students' experiences while using cloud technologies will impact the value of the technologies to assist in class module tasks.
