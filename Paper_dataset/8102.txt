AB As new cloud computing services and technologies penetrate the market gradually, and organizations should constantly redesign and reevaluate demands. Therefore, future assessment should be regulated according to specific criteria. This study adopts Gowin's Vee Model to establish the study process. Literature is employed to investigate relative service quality scales. With Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) as the research foundation, the embryo of cloud computing service quality assessment mechanism is developed and established. For verification, Delphi method is employed to determine the services suitable for measuring the quality of cloud computing. Therefore, the assessment mechanism of cloud computing service quality modified in this study includes five modules, 19 processes, and 44 measurement items. Lastly, after Analytic Hierarchy Process is adopted to confirm the relative weight of measurement items for diverse cloud computing service suppliers. The result can not only help different cloud computing service suppliers clearly define their positions in the market and enhance their competitive advantages, but can also meet the demands and requirements of users.
