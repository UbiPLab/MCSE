AB Along with the development of 5G, NS plays an important role in the application of mobile networks to meet all kinds of personalized requirements. In terms of NS concept, network operators can vertically split a physical network into multiple logically separate networks to flexibly meet QoS requirements, which are mainly represented as higher bandwidth and lower latency. In this article, we propose a novel QoS framework of NS in 5G and beyond networks based on SDN and NFV to guarantee key QoS indicators for different application scenarios, such as eMBB, mMTC and URLLC. In this QoS framework, a 5G network is divided into three parts, RAN, TN and CN, to form three types of NS with different network resource allocation algorithms. The performance evaluation in the simulation environment of Mininet shows that the proposed QoS framework can steer different flows into different queues of OVS, schedule network resources for various NS types and provide reliable E2E QoS for users according to preconfigured QoS requirements.
