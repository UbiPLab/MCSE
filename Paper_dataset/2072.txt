ID CHALLENGES
AB With the fast adoption of cloud computing, the use of biometric technologies has evolved to a different way of providing security, preserving privacy, and analysing personal traits for various purposes. The main components of any biometric system, such as biometric sensing, data gathering, feature extraction, identification, verification, recognition, and analytics, are now handled over distributed networks. Many of the biometric system services are presented over such networks which are followed by the creation of a new concept 'biometric-as-a-service (BaaS)'. Recent BaaS approaches usually focus on identifying the effective distributed architectures, policies, and use case recommendations. However, there is a strong need to focus on developing a semantic framework which should rely on a biometric ontology. This study presents such an ontology covering the uses of different biometric modalities, evaluation and assessment of biometric systems, modelling biometric processes, and analyses through interlinked relations with biometric stakeholders. In order to shed light on how such an ontology is useful for BaaS solutions, a case study focusing on the various uses of biometric modalities is presented. The selected use case addresses the asylum seeker or immigrant identification problems regarding the border security challenges where facial biometrics are benefited.
