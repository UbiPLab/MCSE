AB New reverberation mapping (RM) measurements, combined with accurate luminosities and line ratios, provide strong constraints on the location of the line emitting gas in the broad-line region (BLR) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In this paper, I present new calculations of radiation pressure and magnetic pressure confined clouds and apply them to a 'generic AGN' and to NGC 5548. The new calculations are in good agreement with the observed lags of all broad emission lines, and with the luminosities of Ly alpha, C IV 1549, O VI 1035, and He II 1640. They are also in reasonable agreement with the luminosities of Mg II 2798 and the 1990 angstrom blend of C III] and SiIII] lines for high-metallicity gas. They explain the changes in time-lag following an increase in continuum luminosity and their dependencies on the inner and outer boundaries of the BLR. They also predict very strong Balmer and Paschen continua with important implications to continuum RM experiments. However, the calculated Balmer and Paschen line luminosities are too weak, by factors of 2-5. This 'Balmer line crisis' was noted in several earlier works and is now confirmed and constrained by RM measurements that were not available in the past. It seems that present photoionization codes that use the escape probability formalism fail to correctly compute the Balmer line luminosities in high-density, large optical depth gas.
