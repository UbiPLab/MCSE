AB Cloud computing is one of the largest developments occurred in the field of information technology during recent years. This model has become more desirable for all institutions, organizations and also for personal use thanks to the storage of 'valuable information' at low costs, access to such information from anywhere in the world as well as its ease of use and low cost. In this paper, the services constituting the cloud architecture and deployment models are examined, and the main factors in the provision of security requirements of all those models as well as points to be taken into consideration are described in detail. In addition, the methods and tools considering how security, confidentiality and integrity of the information or data that forms the basis of modern technology are implemented in cloud computing architecture are examined. Finally, it is proposed in the paper that the use of data hiding methods in terms of access security in cloud computing architecture and the security of the stored data would be very effective in securing information.
