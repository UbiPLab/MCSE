AB The large data brings people convenience, but also brings a huge challenge to the current data processing capabilities at the same time. Therefore, in this paper, the data mining algorithm based on cloud computing was studied. The related research of cloud computing and large data was described in detail. The principle and process of the K-means clustering algorithm in the data mining algorithm were discussed. The MapReduce framework in the Hadoop of the cloud computing platform was used to design the K-means clustering algorithm in parallel. The K-means data mining algorithm based on the MapReduce framework was verified by the method of instance verification. The verification results show that the algorithm is a feasible and suitable data mining algorithm for large data mining.
