AB Fog computing has become the revolutionary paradigm and one of the intelligent services of the 5th Generation (5G) emerging network, while Internet of Things (IoT) lies under its main umbrella. Enhancing and optimizing the quality of service (QoS) in Fog computing networks is one of the critical challenges of the present. In the meantime, strong links between the Fog, IoT devices and the supporting back-end servers is done through large scale cloud data centers and with the linear exponential trend of IoT devices and voluminous generated data. Fog computing is one of the vital and potential solutions for IoT in close connection with things and end users with less latency but due to high computational complexity, less storage capacity and more power drain in the cloud it is inappropriate choice. So, to remedy this issue, we propose transmission power control (TPC) based QoS optimization algorithm named (QoS-TPC) in the Fog computing. Besides, we propose the Fog-IoT-TPC-QoS architecture and establish the connection between TPC and Fog computing by considering static and dynamic conditions of wireless channel. Experimental results examine that proposed QoS-TPC optimizes the QoS in terms of maximum throughput, less delay, less jitter and minimum energy drain as compared to the conventional that is, ATPC, SKims and constant TPC methods.
