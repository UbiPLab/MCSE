AB The technology, cloud computing, in present days, is vastly used due to the services it provides and the ease with which they can be availed. The enormous development of the Internet technology is due to the advent of the concept of cloud. Along with its benefits, cloud computing brings along itself a detrimental side effect, i.e., carbon emission. This is due to the massive energy consumption in the cloud data centers. Reduction in energy consumption in cloud is thus one of the major challenges among the researchers. This work conducts a thorough study of the various techniques that help in minimization of energy consumption in data centers. It also explores and proposes approaches to reduce the same, eventually making the environment greener. In the proposed work, prediction mechanism has been adopted and implemented on the existing Minimization of Migration (MM) policy for large history data set, followed by dynamic thresholding mechanism in place of static thresholds. Rigorous simulations have been conducted, and the results show reduction in cloud data center energy consumption.
