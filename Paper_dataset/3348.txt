AB Power and delay aware cloud service provisioning to mobile devices has become a promising domain today. This paper proposes and implements a cooperative offloading approach for indoor mobile cloud network. In the proposed work mobile devices register under femtolet which is a home base station with computation and data storage facilities. The resources of the mobile devices are collaborated in such a way that different mobile devices can execute different types of computations based on cooperative federation. The proposed offloading scheme is referred as cooperative code offloading in femtolet-based fog network. If none of the mobile device can execute the requested computation, then femtolet executes the computation. Use of femtolet provides the mobile devices voice call service as well as cloud service access. Femtolet is used as the fog device in our approach. The proposed model is simulated using Qualnet version 7. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme minimizes the energy by 15% and average delay up to 12% approximately than the existing scheme. Hence, the proposed model is referred as a low power offloading approach.
