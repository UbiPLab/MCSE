AB Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is one of the fundamental image retrieval primitives. Its applications can be found in various areas, such as art collections and medical diagnoses. With an increasing prevalence of cloud computing paradigm, image owners desire to outsource their images to cloud servers. In order to deal with the risk of privacy leakage of images, images are typically encrypted before they are outsourced to the cloud, which makes CBIR an extremely challenging task. Existing studies focus on the scenario with only a single image owner, leaving the problem of CBIR with multiple image sources (i.e., owners) unaddressed.
   In this paper, we propose a secure CBIR scheme that supports Multiple Image owners with Privacy Protection (MIPP). We encrypt image features with a secure multi-party computation technique, which allows image owners to encrypt image features with their own keys. This enables efficient image retrieval over images gathered from multiple sources, while guaranteeing that image privacy of an individual image owner will not be leaked to other image owners. We also propose a new method for similarity measurement of images that can avoid revealing image similarity information to the cloud. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that MIPP achieves retrieval accuracy and efficiency simultaneously, while preserving image privacy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.
