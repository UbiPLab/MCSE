AB Mobile-Edge Computing (MEC) is a new computing paradigm that provides a capillary distribution of cloud computing capabilities to the network edge. In this paper, we studied the security defense problem in MEC network environment. One big challenge is how to efficiently allocate resources to deploy Mobile-Edge Computing-Intrusion Detection Systems (MEC-IDS) in this system, since all the MEC hosts are composed of resource-constrained network devices. To tackle this challenge, a new resource allocation mechanism based on deterministic differential equation model is proposed and investigated. Existence, uniqueness and stability of the positive solution of this model are obtained by using Lyapuonv stability theory. Furthermore, we extended our study to MEC network environment with stochastic perturbation and established a new stochastic differential equation model. We proved the existence, uniqueness, persistence and oscillatory of the positive solution of this model and quantitatively analyzed the relationship between oscillation and intensity of stochastic perturbation. Numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the main results.
