AB To realize the exploration of wireless sensor network (WSN) based on cloud computing, the application service of WSN is taken as the starting point, the resource advantage of the cloud platform is used, and a WSN service framework based on cloud environment is proposed. Based on this framework, the problems of data management and reconstruction, network coverage optimization and monitoring, and edge recognition of holes are solved. In view of the node deployment of WSN and coverage problem of operation and maintenance optimization, the genetic algorithm is used to adjust the dormancy and energy state of nodes, and a parallel genetic algorithm for covering optimization in the cloud environment is proposed. For the operation and maintenance requirements of WSN, a parallel data statistics method for network monitoring is proposed. The experimental results show that the parallel algorithm is greatly improved in terms of the accuracy and time efficiency.
