AB With the rapid growth of internet technologies, large-scale online services, such as data backup and data recovery are increasingly available. Since these large-scale online services require substantial networking, processing, and storage capacities, it has become a considerable challenge to design equally large-scale computing infrastructures that support these services cost-effectively. In response to this rising demand, cloud computing has been refined during the past decade and turned into a lucrative business for organizations that own large datacenters and offer their computing resources. Undoubtedly cloud computing provides tremendous benefits for data storage backup and data accessibility at a reasonable cost. This paper aims at surveying and analyzing the previous works proposed for disaster recovery in cloud computing. The discussion concentrates on investigating the positive aspects and the limitations of each proposal. Also examined are discussed the current challenges in handling data recovery in the cloud context and the impact of data backup plan on maintaining the data in the event of natural disasters. A summary of the leading research work is provided outlining their weaknesses and limitations in the area of disaster recovery in the cloud computing environment. An in-depth discussion of the current and future trends research in the area of disaster recovery in cloud computing is also offered. Several work research directions that ought to be explored are pointed out as well, which may help researchers to discover and further investigate those problems related to disaster recovery in the cloud environment that have remained unresolved.
