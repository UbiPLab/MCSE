ID DATA-STORAGE; SECURE
AB Cloud storage is one of the most important applications in our daily lives. User can store their own data into cloud storage and remotely access the saved data. Owing to the social media develops, users can share the digital files to other users, leading to the amount of data growing rapidly and searching abilities necessarily. In the some cases, servers cannot avoid data leakage even if the server provides complete access control. The encrypted data is a best way to resolve this problem but it may eliminate original structure and searching may become impossible. Applying searchable encryption for each receiver may produce messy duplication and occupy the quota of cloud storage from each receiver. User requires keeping their shared documents belonging up to date which are compared with the latest version. To this aim, we thus propose a sharable ID-based encryption with keyword search in cloud computing environment, which enables users to search in data owners' shared storage while preserving privacy of data. For the performance analysis, we demonstrate the compared resultant with others ID-based or ID-relative encryption. In addition to that, we show the formal proof to verify the security of our proposed.
