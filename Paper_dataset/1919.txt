AB Cloud computing is a new computing paradigm that is revolutionizing the way we access and use computer infrastructure and services. Universities in developing countries lag behind their Western counterparts due to lack of cutting edge technology required for teaching, collaboration, and research. The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors that impact diffusion, adoption, and usage of cloud computing at universities in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). An adoption model was developed focusing on contextual factors and constructs from two technology adoption theories. Structural equation modelling was used for data analysis and model validation. Results from 355 valid responses to a survey of information and communication technology (ICT) experts and decision makers at universities in SSA indicated that socio-cultural factors, results demonstrability, usefulness, and data security significantly impact their propensity to recommend adoption of cloud computing in the universities. The implications of the findings and practical contributions are discussed.
