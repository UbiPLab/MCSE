AB Cloud computing companies need to achieve a balance between service openness and security control to promote the growth of the cloud service business. This paper is a theoretical discussion of the complete service openness condition and the complete security control condition based on Nash equilibrium from the perspective of investment, including investment in service and investment in security by the cloud computing company. The quantitative assessment methods of two conditions are designed based on the investments. A quantitative analysis of the impact of security investments on security control and service openness is presented. Based on this analysis, the optimal security investment for service openness and the minimum complete service openness investment standard are derived. Finally, the relationship between them is analyzed to help cloud computing providers decide the optimal strategy for coordinating investment in both service and security.
