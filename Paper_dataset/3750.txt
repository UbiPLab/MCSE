AB An effective load balancing mechanism maximizes the throughput minimizes the response time with fault tolerance. Load imbalance problems occasionally occur during the over-demanding of resources from VMs. Load balance mechanisms manage the load by allocating jobs and reallocation of VMs. This article proposes the Dynamic Weighted Live Migration (DWLM) mechanism. DWLM mechanism based on LP-formulation-based heuristic approaches to dynamically manage load balancing. DWLM approaches use transfer, selection, and location polices. These policies work based on an information policy. The authors map the result in migration time, throughput, response time and fault tolerance. The proposed DWLM mechanism gives the best results from Equally Spared Current Execution (ESCEL) and Push-Pull mechanisms. A comparison table and associated charts show the efficiency of the proposed DWLM mechanism.
