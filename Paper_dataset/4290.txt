   Discovery; Services Composition
AB Owing to the huge number of Cloud services which are currently available on the market and to the lack of a commonly accepted standard for a machine-readable description of their interfaces, automatic discovery and composition tools and techniques for interoperable Cloud services are still in an early stage of development. Moreover, the current tools do not provide a very user-friendly interface to interact with. In this paper a service for the automatic discovery and composition of Cloud services, guided by Cloud Patterns, is presented. By means of a user-friendly interface, the user can both define a new services' composition, with the creation of a new pattern, or modify an existing one. The proposed service exploits a semantic based representation of Cloud services and patterns, complemented by a description of the input and output parameters for the several described services and of the patterns' workflow.
