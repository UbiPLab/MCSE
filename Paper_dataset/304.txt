AB In this paper, a QR Code Identity Tag System designed for Turkish healthcare and served through the cloud is presented. The system designed is a distributed information management system as the medical data objects are geographically distributed over the system. The data objects are geographically distributed as they are placed on servers closest to the geographical location where they are most frequently required. This enables that the data is always available and the access is provided in minimum time. Additionally, to improve the performance the system employs Mobile Edge Computing technology in the form of cloudlets. The simulation results show that system performance improves as the number of cloudlets used increases and popularity threshold decreases.
