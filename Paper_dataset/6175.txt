AB Cloud computing provided as a utility has emerged in recent years. Resource allocation mechanisms play a critical role toward the success of cloud computing. Maximization of social welfare is the reasonable objective of private clouds. Cloud resources are expiring goods, and users come to cloud randomly. However, because of the dynamic behavior of cloud providers and users, existing allocation mechanisms in public clouds with static environments are unsuitable for private IaaS clouds in dynamic environments, given that they can neither maximize the sum of the users' value, nor provide service guarantees. In order to mitigate this problem, we propose a novel online cloud resources allocation mechanism to capture the features of private clouds. In this paper, we propose a latest-reservation allocation mechanism to maximize social welfare. We also prove that our mechanism is truthful. We simulate the proposed online mechanism using data from RICC, thus showing that our mechanism leads to high social welfare and high percentage of served users compared with the MOVMPA mechanism.
