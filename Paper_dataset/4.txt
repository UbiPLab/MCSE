AB Computer vision applications in the industry have been a constant field of research in academia. Industrial daily challenges such as quality inspection, object detection, and measurement are examples of situations where some automation could be done by using computer vision techniques. In this paper, a cloud-based approach of an automatic system based on stereo vision and image analysis has been developed to automate a daily routine present in machining companies: workpiece referencing. The proposed architecture uses two cameras mounted in the spindle of a machining center. All images are processed in custom software, running on the cloud, to return the position of the Workpiece Coordinate System (WCS) directly to the Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine controller. Experimental results validate the application of the proposed architecture in a real machining process machine.
