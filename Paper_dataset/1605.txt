AB In cloud computing environments, data processing systems with strong and stochastic stream data processing capabilities are highly desired by multi-service oriented computing-intensive applications. The independeny of different business data streams makes these services very suitable for parallel processing with the aid of multicore processors. Furthermore, for the random crossing of data streams between different services, data synchronization is required. Aiming at the stochastic cross service stream, we propose a hardware synchronization mechanism based on index tables. By using a specifically designed hardware synchronization circuit, we can record the business index number (BIN) of the input and output data flow of the processing unit. By doing so, we can not only obtain the flow control of the job package accessing the processing units, but also guarantee that the work of the processing units is single and continuous. This approach overcomes the high complexity and low reliability of the programming in the software synchronization. As demonstrated by numerical experiment results, the proposed scheme can ensure the validity of the cross service stream, and its processing speed is better than that of the lock-based synchronization scheme. This scheme is applied to a cryptographic server and accelerates the processing speed of the cryptographic service.
