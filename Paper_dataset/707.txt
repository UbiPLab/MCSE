AB Modern cloud computing platforms based on virtual machine monitors (VMMs) host a variety of complex businesses which present many network security vulnerabilities. In order to protect network security for these businesses in cloud computing, nowadays, a number of middleboxes are deployed at front-end of cloud computing or parts of middleboxes are deployed in cloud computing. However, the former is leading to high cost and management complexity, and also lacking of network security protection between virtual machines while the latter does not effectively prevent network attacks from external traffic. To address the above-mentioned challenges, we introduce a novel customized network security for cloud service (CNS), which not only prevents attacks from external and internal traffic to ensure network security of services in cloud computing, but also affords customized network security service for cloud users. CNS is implemented by modifying the Xen hypervisor and proved by various experiments which showing the proposed solution can be directly applied to the extensive practical promotion in cloud computing.
