AB Cloud Computing has emerged as the prime IT computing model for an on-demand access using a pool of shared resources with least IT support. Cloud computing is starting to replace the legacy office IT infrastructure and helpdesk support system. Corporate and home users alike are turning into cloud service consumers in a huge way and moving their data and work to the cloud. Therefore, the CSA between the cloud service consumers and cloud service providers has critical significance that can guarantee the highest-level service quality and delivery. The current CSA fall short on the service delivery commitments with no common terminology or standard followed industry wide by the cloud service providers. Comparing agreements from multiple cloud service providers continues to be an issue. This paper provides a pragmatic approach for Cloud Service Agreements, comparing the current process with the proposed parameters and the new framework for CSA to determine the role of various elements and terms in the decision-making process for cloud service agreements for SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and STaaS.
