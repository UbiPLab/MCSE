AB To determine the viability of cloud computing as a source of competitive advantage, we integrate the theory of diffusion of innovations and the theory of dynamic capabilities to synthesize the strengths of these theories into a framework. The theoretical framework with 13 propositions would enhance conceptual understanding of strategic initialization of cloud computing and its outcomes and should serve as a foundation for further theoretical and empirical investigations.
