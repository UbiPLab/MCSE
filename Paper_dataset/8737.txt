AB This research presents the design and development of a distance laboratory package for teaching undergraduate students basic electronics via the LabVIEW program to foster more understanding through additional practice in conventional contexts rather than studying only theory in the classroom. This research consists of two main parts. The first part is the design and development of the experimental set. The subject content was analyzed to design the experiment. The competencies and skills for each topic were defined using objective analysis. Design of the experimental procedures and tools for the laboratory were implemented using task analysis. The second part is the design of the laboratory sheet on the LabVIEW program. The results revealed that students who studied with the specified experimental set had higher achievement at a significantly increasing level (0.05).
