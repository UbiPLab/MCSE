AB As an emerging industry, the LED industry is still in its initial stage of development, and its conspicuous problems of poor confidentiality of the infoimation system and imperfect safeguard measures, leading to the drain of technical information and hindering the development of enterprises. In order to solve the problem of information security access and sharing mechanism in LED industry under cloud services, the thesis proposes the protection model of small user sharing of cloud security, and compares such attributes as encryption, decryption and revocation of the secure access mechanism of LED industry with other programs, through the study of improbable secure access model from the perspective of cloud security sharing, finding that the secure access mechanism of the information system of the LED industry is with strong security, high efficiency and high accuracy; the information sharing mechanism is with strong security, fast computing speed and privacy. From the cloud security, the encryption of content in the mechanism, the realization of anonymous evaluation, the susceptibility and unnecessary re-encryption save the computing time and cost. The model built in the thesis is secure in both the information security access and sharing of the LED industry, has advantages in application and lays a theoretical foundation for practical application.
