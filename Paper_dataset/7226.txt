AB Mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets are increasingly important tools in daily routine. These devices generally interact with more powerful machines usually hosted on public clouds. In this context, this paper presents MpOS (Multiplatform Offloading System), a framework that supports a method-based offloading technique for applications of different mobile platforms (Android and Windows Phone). In addition, details of MpOS main components and services as well as code examples are presented. To evaluate the proposed solution and to analyse the impact of different serialization types on the offloading performance, we developed two applications and performed several experiments on both Android and Windows Phone platforms using WiFi and 4G/LTE connections to access the remote execution environments. Our results state that offloading to a cloudlet has provided the best performance for both Android and Windows Phone platforms, beyond showing that the type of serialization used by the framework directly impacts on the offloading performance.
