AB The characteristics of the new generation of artificial intelligence technology are shown as follows: with the help of GPU computing, cloud computing and other high-performance distributed computing capabilities, machine learning algorithms represented by deep learning algorithms are used for learning and training on big data to simulate, extend and expand human intelligence. Different data sources and computing physical locations make the current machine learning face serious privacy leakage problem, so the Privacy Protection of Machine (PPM) Learning has become a widely concerned research area. Using cryptography technology to solve the problem of privacy in machine learning is an important technology to protect the privacy of machine learning. Cryptographic tools used in privacy-preserving machine learning are introduced, such as general Secure Multi-Party Computing (SMPC), privacy protection set operation and Homomorphic Encryption (HE), describes the status and developments applying the tools to solving the problems of privacy protection in various stages of machine learning, such as data processing, model training, model testing, and data prediction.
