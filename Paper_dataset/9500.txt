DE Laser 3D scanner; 3D reconstruction; Image processing
AB In this paper, we propose a three-dimensional (3D) scanning system based on two line lasers. This system uses two line lasers with different wavelengths as light sources. 532-nm and 630-nm line lasers can compensate for missing scan data generated by geometrical occlusion. It also can classify two laser planes by using the red and green channels. For automatic registration of scanning data, we control a stepping motor and divide the motor's rotational degree of freedom into micro-steps. To this end, we design a control printed circuit board for the laser and stepping motor, and use an image processing board. To compute a 3D point cloud, we obtain 200 and 400 images with laser lines and segment lines on the images at different degrees of rotation. The segmented lines are thinned for one-to-one matching of an image pixel with a 3D point.
