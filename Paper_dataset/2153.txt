AB Computation offloading is a proven successful paradigm for enabling resource-intensive applications on mobile devices. Moreover, in view of emerging mobile collaborative application, the offloaded tasks can be duplicated when multiple users are in the same proximity. This motivates us to design a collaborative offloading scheme and cache the popular computation results that are likely to be reused by other mobile users. In this paper, we consider the scenario where multiple mobile users offload duplicated computation tasks to the network edge, and share the computation results among them. Our goal is to develop the optimal finegrained collaborative offloading strategies with caching enhancements to minimize the overall execution delay at the mobile terminal side. To this end, we propose an optimal offloading with cachingenhancement scheme (OOCS) for femto-cloud scenario and mobile edge computing scenario, respectively. Simulation results show that compared to six alternative solutions in literature, our single-user OOCS can reduce execution delay up to 42.83% and 33.28% for single-user femto-cloud and single-user mobile edge computing, respectively. Our multi-user OOCS can further reduce 11.71% delay compared to single-user OOCS through users' cooperation.
