   provenance challenges
AB Cloud computing is a newly emerging technology where storage, computation and services are extensively shared among a large number of users through virtualization and distributed computing. This technology makes the process of detecting the physical location or ownership of a particular piece of data even more complicated. As a result, improvements in data provenance techniques became necessary. Provenance refers to the record describing the origin and other historical information about a piece of data. An advanced data provenance system will give forensic investigators a transparent idea about the data's lineage, and help to resolve disputes over controversial pieces of data by providing digital evidence. In this paper, the challenges of cloud architecture are identified, how this affects the existing forensic analysis and provenance techniques is discussed, and a model for efficient provenance collection and forensic analysis is proposed.
