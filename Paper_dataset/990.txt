AB Rapidly growing technological advances in big data, cloud computing, social media, artificial intelligence, virtual reality and digital media have led many educators to embark upon the pursuit and deployment of various digital tools in the classroom. They started implementing a technology-centered educational system in order to expand their pedagogical approaches and increase the possibilities of creatively putting ideas together and innovatively conveying their knowledge to their students. In this paper, we explore the convergence of creativity, technology, with art and design education, and we advocate the use of digital tools and repurposing of social media applications to support creative thinking. We discuss existing multimedia-based classroom practices that might encourage student creativity and suggest new forms and applications of technology aimed at providing the reflective teacher with more effective and efficient strategies to cultivate creativity while teaching art, design, and digital media courses.
