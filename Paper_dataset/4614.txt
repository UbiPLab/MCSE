AB This study aims to present changes that are taking place in the market of logistics services as a result of the development of digital technologies and show their influence on the business models of logistics service providers. In her research, the author applied Porter's 5 forces model as a theoretical framework for the analysis in the area of innovation and technology in logistics. The study uses the deduction method. This is a conceptual paper based on the analysis of secondary materials, i.e., examples of innovative logistics solutions, reports of research agencies and consulting companies, and literature studies. The results of the analysis show that we are dealing with the digital transformation of the logistics service industry (not digital destruction). Technologies like sensors, robots, automation, cloud computing, data analysis, 3D printing, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence, digital twins or blockchain technology supplement but not replace the real world of logistics by providing customers with higher logistics service value.
