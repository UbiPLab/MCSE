AB Replacing hardware controllers with software-based virtual process control functions (VPFs) is a promising approach for improving the operational efficiency and flexibility of industrial control systems. VPFs can be executed in edge clouds in 5G mobile networks or in the wireless backhaul, which can further improve efficiency. Nonetheless, for the acceptance of virtualization in industrial control systems, a fundamental challenge is to ensure that the placement of VPFs be resilient to component failures and cyber-attacks, besides being efficient. In this paper we address this challenge by considering that VPF placement costs are incurred by reserving mobile edge computing (MEC) resources, executing VPF instances, and by data communication. We formulate the VPF placement problem as an integer programming problem, considering resilience as a constraint. We propose a solution based on generalized Benders decomposition and based on linear relaxation of the resulting sub-problems, which effectively reduces the number of integer variables to the number of MEC nodes. We evaluate the proposed solution with respect to operational cost, efficiency, and scalability in a simulated metropolitan area. Our results show that the proposed solution reduces the total cost significantly compared to a greedy baseline algorithm and a local search heuristic, and can scale to moderate problem instances.
