AB Resource over provisioning in cloud computing consumes energy excessively. Energy-aware dynamic virtual machine consolidation (DVMC) reduces energy consumption without compromising service level agreement. In this paper, we put forward a new framework of DVMC for green cloud computing. In particular, we propose a new virtual machine (VM) placement policy, namely, space aware best fit decreasing (SABFD) and a new migration VM selection policy, namely, high CPU utilization-based migration VM selection (called HS). Thorough simulations are carried out to evaluate the performances of different energy-aware DVMC plans based on real-world workload traces, with DVMC plans as various combinations of host overload detection, migration VM selection, and VM placement policies. The simulation results show that DVMC plans with SABFD policy or with HS policy outperforms alternative DVMC plans. What is more, a DVMC plan with both SABFD and HS policies makes the best performance.
