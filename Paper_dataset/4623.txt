AB The exponential growth in the usage of cloud environment with increased usability of data and the explosion of data from various sources lead to the data replication in cloud computing. Cloud is a popular platform for replication of recurrently used data which is emerged as a prevalent alternative to the traditional cluster based replication to sustain growing demand of data and to provide high data availability & improved performance. This research article will consider the parameters such as number of inbound user's requests, diversified structures of cloud storage, accessible bandwidth and wavering degree of popularity of the contents to investigate and provide comparative analysis of available replication strategies. The data in demand is replicated on the desired node in the cloud environment which leads to better data availability, faster data access and optimized utilization of bandwidth. The replica is created if the content popularity crosses the threshold, to retain the high availability of the data in the system. When the popularity of the data reduces with the dropping demands, the stale replica needs to be withdrawn from the data node. This paper proposes a method of creation and withdrawal of the replica depending on the content popularity threshold to provide an effective replication strategy and also to provide increased availability with optimal storage consumption in the data nodes.
