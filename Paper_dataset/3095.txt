AB The users of Cloud computing over the last years are constantly increasing since it has become a very important technology in the computing landscape. It provides client decentralized services and a pay-as-you-go model for consuming resources. The growing need for the cloud services oblige the providers to adopt an enlarged sized data center infrastructure which runs thousands of hosts and servers to store and process data. As a result, these large servers engender a lot of heat with visual carbon emission in the air, as well as important energy consumption and higher operating cost. This is why researches in energy economics continue to progress including energy saving techniques in servers, in the network, cooling, and renewable energies, etc. In this paper, we tackled the existing energy efficient methods in the green cloud computing fields and we put forward our green cloud solution for data center dynamic resource management. Our proposed approach aims to reduce the infrastructure energy consumption and maintain the required performances.
