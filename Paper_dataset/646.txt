AB The rise of the intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) promotes the development of emerging technologies and industries with the integration of edge computing and cloud computing. This integrated paradigm becomes a promising prospect to continuously expand the service capabilities of IoT. However, edge-driven intelligent IoT systems raises serious security issues as the systems are prone to be compromised by malicious attacks. In this article, an edge-driven security framework is investigated for intelligent IoT systems. First, we introduce the architecture of edge-driven intelligent IoT, and present typical edge-driven intelligent IoT applications. Second, we point out the security threats in edge-driven intelligent IoT in terms of attack behaviors of adversaries. Third, we develop a case study of edge-driven intelligent IoT from the security perspective. Finally, we discuss future research directions in this emerging area.
