AB The eco-environment is dynamic and shows a continuous process of long-term change. It is helpful for policymakers to know the status of the regional eco-environment through accurate evaluations of the history and current situation of the regional eco-environment. The remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) model of China was established in this study by using four indexes: wetness, greenness, dryness, and heat. Knowledge granulation of the RSEIs were carried out, and a method to determine the weights of the knowledge granulation entropy of the indexes based on their characteristics was proposed. This study used Moderate Resolution Image Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from the Google Cloud Computing Platform to study and calculate the eco-environmental quality of China from 2000-2017. The overall eco-environmental quality in China tended to improve from 2000-2017, although there were large areas of ecological degradation from 2009-2014. The eco-environment of eastern China was better than that of western China. Most of the national ecological areas were third-level ecological areas, which had moderate environmental quality. Dryness was the most important factor affecting the quality of the eco-environment, followed by greenness, which reflected the increasing environmental damage caused by human activities in China in recent years.
