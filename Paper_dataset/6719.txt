AB With the rapid development of electronic technology, network technology and cloud computing technology, the current data is increasing in the way of mass, has entered the era of big data. Based on cloud computing clusters, this paper proposes a novel method of parallel implementation of multilayered neural networks based on Map-Reduce. Namely in order to meet the requirements of big data processing, this paper presents an efficient mapping scheme for a fully connected multi-layered neural network, which is trained by using error back propagation (BP) algorithm based on Map-Reduce on cloud computing clusters (MRBP). The batch-training (or epoch-training) regimes are used by effective segmentation of samples on the clusters, and are adopted in the separated training method, weight summary to achieve convergence by iterating. For a parallel BP algorithm on the clusters and a serial BP algorithm on uniprocessor, the required time for implementing the algorithms is derived. The performance parameters, such as speed-up, optimal number and minimum of data nodes are evaluated for the parallel BP algorithm on the clusters. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed parallel BP algorithm in this paper has better speed-up, faster convergence rate, less iterations than that of the existed algorithms.
