AB In order to improve the quality and efficiency of resource scheduling algorithm in cloud computing environment, the data-intensive cloud computing method is applied in this paper. In the cloud, the computing unit is virtual machine (VM) based; therefore, it is important to demonstrate the applicability of data-intensive computing on a virtualized data center. As a result, the current pay-as-you-go is neither personally nor socially fair. Accordingly, to solve the unfairness caused by interference, new pricing scheme (pay-as-you-consume) is proposed. In the pay-as-you-consume pricing scheme, users are charged according to their effective resource consumption excluding interference. The key idea behind the pay-as-you-consume pricing scheme is a machine learning based prediction model on the relative cost of interference. From the experiment result and data analysis, the proposed method can improve the performance of whole system substantially.
