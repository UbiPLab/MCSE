AB The paper introduces DeepForge, a gateway to deep learning for scientific computing. DeepForge provides an easy to use, yet powerful visual/textual interface to facilitate the rapid development of deep learning models by novices as well as experts. Utilizing a cloud-based infrastructure, built-in version control, and multiuser collaboration support, DeepForge promotes reproducibility and ease of access and enables remote execution of machine learning pipelines. The tool currently supports TensorFlow/Keras, but its extensible architecture enables easy integration of additional platforms.
