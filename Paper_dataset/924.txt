AB The article presents an efficient energy optimization framework based on dynamic resource scheduling for VM migration in cloud data centers. This increasing number of cloud data centers all over the world are consuming a vast amount of power and thus, exhaling a huge amount of CO, that has a strong negative impact on the environment. Therefore, implementing Green cloud computing by efficient power reduction is a momentous research area. Live Virtual Machine (VM) migration, and server consolidation technology along with appropriate resource allocation of users' tasks, is particularly useful for reducing power consumption in cloud data centers. In this article, the authors propose algorithms which mainly consider live VM migration techniques for power reduction named "Power_reduction" and "VM_migration." Moreover, the authors implement dynamic scheduling of servers based on sequential search, random search, and a maximum fairness search for convenient allocation and higher utilization of resources. The authors perform simulation work using CloudSim and the Cloudera simulator to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms. Results show that the proposed approaches achieve around 30% energy savings than the existing algorithms.
