AB Reliability and high availability have always been a major concern in distributed systems. Providing highly available and reliable services in cloud computing is essential for maintaining customer confidence and satisfaction and preventing revenue losses. Although various solutions have been proposed for cloud availability and reliability, but there are no comprehensive studies that completely cover all different aspects in the problem. This paper presented a 'Reference Roadmap' of reliability and high availability in cloud computing environments. A big picture was proposed which was divided into four steps specifying through four pivotal questions starting with 'Where?', 'Which?', 'When?' and 'How?' keywords. The desirable result of having a highly available and reliable cloud system could be gained by answering these questions. Each step of this reference roadmap proposed a specific concern of a special portion of the issue. Two main research gaps were proposed by this reference roadmap.
