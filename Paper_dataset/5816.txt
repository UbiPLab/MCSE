AB Remote sensing techniques based on medium resolution satellite imagery are being widely applied for mapping plastic covered greenhouses (PCG). This article aims at testing the spectral consistency of surface reflectance values of Sentinel-2 MSI (S2 L2A) and Landsat 8 OLI (L8 L2 and the pansharpened and atmospherically corrected product from L1T product; L8 PANSH) data in PCG areas located in Spain, Morocco, Italy and Turkey. The six corresponding bands of S2 and L8, together with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), were generated through an OBIA approach for each PCG study site. The coefficient of determination (r(2)) and the root mean square error (RMSE) were computed in sixteen cloud-free simultaneously acquired image pairs from the four study sites to evaluate the coherence between the two sensors. It was found that the S2 and L8 correlation (r(2)> 0.840, RMSE < 9.917%) was quite good in most bands and NDVI. However, the correlation of the two sensors fluctuated between study sites, showing occasional sun glint effects on PCG roofs related to the sensor orbit and sun position. Moreover, higher surface reflectance discrepancies between L8 L2 and L8 PANSH data, mainly in the visible bands, were always observed in areas with high-level aerosol values derived from the aerosol quality band included in the L8 L2 product (SR aerosol). In this way, the consistency between L8 PANSH and S2 L2A was improved mainly in high-level aerosol areas according to the SR aerosol band.
