ID FUTURE
AB Given the current expansion of cloud computing, the expected advent of the Internet of Things, and the requirements of future fifth-generation network infrastructures, significantly larger pools of computational and storage resources will soon be required. This emphasizes the need for more scalable data centers that are capable of providing such an amount of resources in a cost-effective way. A quick look into today's commercial data centers shows that they tend to rely on variations of well-defined leaf-spine/Clos data center network (DCN) topologies, offering low latency, ultrahigh bisectional bandwidth, and enhanced reliability against concurrent failures. However, DCNs are typically restricted by the use of the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite, thus suffering limited routing scalability. In this work, we study the benefits that replacing TCP/IP with the recursive internetwork architecture (RINA) can bring into commercial DCNs, focusing on forwarding and routing scalability. We quantitatively evaluate the benefits that RINA solutions can yield against those based on TCP/IP and highlight how, by deploying RINA, topological routing solutions can improve even more the efficiency of the network. To this goal, we propose a rule-and-exception forwarding policy tailored to the characteristics of several DCN variants, enabling fast forwarding decisions with merely neighbors' information. Upon failures, few exceptions are necessary, whose computation can also profit from the known topology. Extensive numerical results show that the proposed policy requirements depend mainly on the number of neighbors and concurrent failures in the DCN rather than its size, dramatically reducing the amount of forwarding and routing information stored at DCN nodes.
