AB In the Internet of Things (IoT), identification and resolution of physical object is crucial for authenticating object's identity, controlling service access, and establishing trust between object and cloud service. With the development of computer vision and pattern recognition technologies, face has been used as a high-security identification and identity authentication method which has been deployed in various applications. Face identification can ensure the consistency between individual in physical-space and his/her identity in cyber-space during the physical-cyber space mapping. However, face is a non-code and unstructured identifier. With the increase of applications in current big data environment, the characteristic of face identification will result in the growing demands for computation power and storage capacity. In this paper, we propose a face identification and resolution scheme based on cloud computing to solve the above problem. The face identification and resolution system model is presented to introduce the processes of face identifier generation and matching. Then, parallel matching mechanism and cloud computing-based resolution framework are proposed to efficiently resolve face image, control personal data access and acquire individual's identity information. It makes full use of the advantages of cloud computing to effectively improve computation power and storage capacity. The experimental result of prototype system indicates that the proposed scheme is practically feasible and can provide efficient face identification and resolution service. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.
