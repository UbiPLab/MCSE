AB With the proliferation of various big data applications and resource demand from Internet data centers (IDCs), the energy cost has been skyrocketing, and it attracts a great deal of attention and brings many energy optimization management issues. However, the security problem for a wide range of applications, which has been overlooked, is another critical concern and even ranked as the greatest challenge in IDC. In this paper, we propose an energy cost minimization (ECM) algorithm with job security guarantee for IDC in deregulated electricity markets. Randomly arriving jobs are routed to a FIFO queue, and a heuristic algorithm is devised to select security levels for guaranteeing job risk probability constraint. Then, the energy optimization problem is formulated by taking the temporal diversity of electricity price into account. Finally, an online energy cost minimization algorithm is designed to solve the problem by Lyapunov optimization framework which offers provable energy cost optimization and delay guarantee. This algorithm can aggressively and adaptively seize the timing of low electricity price to process workloads and defer delay-tolerant workloads execution when the price is high. Based on the real-life electricity price, simulation results prove the feasibility and effectiveness of proposed algorithm. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
