AB This paper offers a case study in which a traditional Learning Management System (LMS) was enhanced through learning theories and web-based technologies to support the development of doctoral students. The model being used here, can address and support a personalised learning approach to assist postgraduate students, as part of matching their skills with a repository of rich media and activities. The mixed method research approach adopted here aided into the investigation into the Graduate Virtual Research Environment (GVRE) while analysing factors like usability, accessibility, goal orientation and evolving the learners' needs. The author argues by tailoring the gap between learning theories and technology with the complexities of human nature one can adapt the educational setting to provide a LMS which can be personalized for doctoral students.
