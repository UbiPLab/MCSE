AB Mobile Cloud Computing is one of today's more disruptive paradigms of computation due to its effects on the performance of mobile computing and the development of Internet of Things. It is able to enhance the capabilities of devices by outsourcing the workload to external computing platforms deployed along the network, such as cloud servers, cloudlets, or other edge platforms. The research described in this work presents a computational model of a multilayer architecture for increasing the performance of devices using the Mobile Cloud Computing paradigm. The main novelty of this work lies in defining a comprehensive model where all the available computing platforms along the network layers are involved to perform the outsourcing of the application workload. This proposal provides a generalization of the Mobile Cloud Computing paradigm which allows handling the complexity of scheduling tasks in such complex scenarios. The behaviour of the model and its ability of generalization of the paradigm are exemplified through simulations. The results show higher flexibility for making offloading decisions.
