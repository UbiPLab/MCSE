AB With the development of information and network, information technology has been widely used in people's daily life, production, the government operation and other aspects. The Web2.0 era has been very mature, and mobile Internet is in a period of rapid development. In this paper, based on cloud computing and J2EE technology, the HIRSPRINT algorithm designed in the system is improved and optimized. Take the needs of College comprehensive laboratory information system as the starting point, and then carry out the research on laboratory management information system based on cloud computing and J2EE environment, and take a specific laboratory management information system construction as an example to carry out systematical design.
