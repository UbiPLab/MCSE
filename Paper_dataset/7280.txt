DE cloud computing; resource management system; Virtualization
AB With the success of cloud computing technology, cloud computing system has become an important research direction. In the system, different heterogeneous resources are distributed in different physical locations, which require the resource management system of the platform to organize and form a unified resource pool to provide different levels of services for multiple users. In the research, the research status quo of the subject was investigated, the related theory and technology of the subject were analyzed, the cloud computing resource management system was established, the system was carried out an example experiment, and the feasibility and advancedness of the system were explained through specific detailed data.
