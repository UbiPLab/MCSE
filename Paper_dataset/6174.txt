AB With ever increasing demand for cloud computing services, the rate for the security threats has amplified drastically and this cannot be overlooked. Cloud-based systems can be used for storing and processing highly confidential data. These threats create a chaotic situation that is restricting the adoption rate of cloud-based services. In this paper, we anticipate giving a proposal that identifies and handle the security issues present in the system. Our proposal would first find the potential threats to the cloud system, and then algorithms implemented by the existing systems are evaluated by calculating the security index to check if they can protect the system from identified threats. Security index is the metric representing the risk measure of live threats in the system.
