AB Cloud computing is an aspired reverie of computing that provides a huge capacity of storage. The users of the cloud, store large volumes of their private data, where sometimes they have to suffer vulnerabilities and attacks on it. Since there is only partial control over the stored data, the users require strong and significant protection techniques to guard their data. The protection of data storage is a challenging and formidable task and so the user data should be protected against security threats. There is a great deal of uncertainty on how to provide security for the user data also. Thus, encrypting the data before storage might be the most promising approach. In this paper, a hybrid layered approach is proposed to protect the user's data along with the association of lattice-based security technique. In this proposed model, a new approach has been incorporated for checking roles and responsibilities using lattice model. For this implementation text-based Patient Health care Records (PHR) are taken and significance of the proposed method is tested. Advanced Encryption Standard and Rivest-Shamir-Adleman are employed in this approach to provide further and better security to the sensitive data. The proposed model uses a CloudSim simulator in which virtual machine has been created with balanced configuration and it is implemented as well as tested. Compared to the existing methods, the proposed scheme is more secure and we offers easy interface to the patients for uploading and downloading their records. We have tested the differed parameters of proposed method with state of art approaches. The experimentation results show that the proposed scheme is more efficient. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
