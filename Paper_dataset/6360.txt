AB The energy consumption of data centers has been increasing with the growth of cloud computing services. There has thus been a growing interest in the environmental performance of data centers. Fujitsu Group added the target of "achieving green data centers" to the Fujitsu Group Environmental Action Plan in 2012 and established the Green Datacenter (GDC) Committee in pursuit of lowering the environmental load of data centers in Japan and abroad. First, we benchmarked 34 major data centers and identified key challenges for short- and mid- to long-term periods. Second, we prepared guidelines specifying improvement measures for these data centers as a basis for action. For this, we created a dashboard that enables the user to determine the results of measures in terms of energy consumption and efficiency. Concurrently, a collaboration system was developed that enables the results to be promptly shared among members of the GDC Committee in order to promote this initiative. We have also been working on a number of long-term projects such as an innovative air conditioning technology using artificial intelligence and a submersion liquid cooling system for servers. This paper reports Fujitsu's various efforts to realize green data centers.
