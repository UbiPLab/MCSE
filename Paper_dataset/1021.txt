AB The use of mobile technologies, web tools and applications are the basic characteristics of the student centered m-learning. Students have the possibility to be active, motivated, and responsible for their personal learning process; they can progress according to their individual knowledge and interests, communicate and use different learning styles. This paper analyses theoretical background, possibilities and challenges using m-learning in foreign language teaching. Special attention was paid to web tools and applications as the most accessible mobile resources. The aim of this research is to conduct a qualitative analysis of models (technological, pedagogical, and pedagogical-technological models) for integrating m-learning in foreign language teaching within subject teaching. The conducted analysis indicates that m-learning technologies can improve foreign language teaching, and that free web tools and applications available for teaches are at satisfactory quality level. M-learning can be integrated through a two-phase implementation process which requires time and system support. Significant improvement of m-learning can be expected with the development of digital competencies of foreign language teachers (within the initial education and professional development), as well as by increasing the quality of digital content.
