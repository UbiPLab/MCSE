AB The mobility of people is one of the main critical aspects related to daily life in a city, causing both traffic congestion and pollution. Smart-mobility services based on vehicular cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) are emerging as new solutions that can address such issues. In this context, the FIWARE acceleration program, along with the frontierCities initiative, paved the way toward the development of new smart-mobility services. This article discusses different performance indicators that must be considered for the design and development of smart-mobility services adopting FIWARE technology. To this end, the authors consider the home-office mobility of University of Messina personnel as a case study. In particular, after a preliminary analysis of traveling habits, the authors gained insights on how FIWARE can lead to agile development of smart-mobility services that can minimize traffic congestion, fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions.
