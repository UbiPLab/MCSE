AB As clinical records continue to become digitized, technological competence is increasingly part of clinical competence. Clinicians must be mindful of how they are storing client data and consult with information technology professionals to best protect client data stored online. Clinicians have offline, local computer storage options that require minimal technological competence, but it is essential for clinicians and practices to be thoughtful in storing client data in ways that both suit their clinical needs and best protect client data. A practice without compelling reasons for storing client data in an online environment exposes client data to undue risk, because of the multitude of security vulnerabilities to which such data are exposed. Given the increasing reliance on electronic records, it is important for clinicians to understand exactly how such records are stored, accessed, and transferred. Although all technology can fail, clinicians who carefully consider their own unique data storage needs and have robust reasons for how they store their data can best uphold the ethical standards of privacy and confidentiality with an understanding of how client data is being stored.
   Public Significance Statement
   This article explores whether or not psychological clinicians can ethically store client data online and gives recommendations to help guide clinicians. Because of the large number of online security threats, clinicians must provide clear rational for hosting client data online, particularly because there are a number of local storage options for clinicians that do not require much skill with technology to use securely.
