DE Cloud computing; multi-tenant; collaboration; fine-grained authorization
AB Tenants in the cloud computing environment share various services, including storage, network, computing, and applications. For better use of services in the cloud computing environment, tenants collaborate in tasks, resulting in challenges to the traditional access control. This study proposes a cross-tenant role-based access control (CT-RBAC) model for collaborative cloud services. This model covers the CT-RBACO, CT-RBAC1, CT-RBAC2, and CT-RBAC3 models. The model not only extends the RBAC model in the multi-tenant cloud computing mode but also includes four types of authorization modes among tenants. Consequently, the role inheritance constraint is increased, and fine-grained authorization access among trusted tenants is realized.
