AB Higher education institutions could introduce enormous cloud-based educational services that satisfy their stakeholders' IT needs. Migration to these pools of cloud services is multiple decision-making processes that are impacted by different organizational and technological obstacles and drivers. Investigating the preparedness of the internal technological and organizational capabilities of a university still lacks investigation particularly in Saudi Arabia. In this study, the practicality of a research instrument called Cloud Migration Readiness Assessment (CMRA) is assessed by using three case studies. The development of the instrument was published earlier. In this study, the validation of the instrument outputs is investigated by assessing the readiness of the three cases that already have planned to adopt the cloud computing services. Subsequently, the practicality and usefulness of the CMRA were assessed using a questionnaire and interviews with IT specialists in the three selected cases. The main contribution of this study is the validation and evaluation of the CMRA tool in real-world context using three different case studies in Saudi Universities.
