AB Parkinson's Disease (PD) is one of the most severe neurological diseases prevalent in the world. A neurodegenerative disease, it impairs the body's balance, damages motor skills, and leads to disorder in speech production. These problems also affect decision-making processes and the expression of emotions. In this paper, we propose a PD monitoring framework for use in smart cities. Using this framework, city residents will have their health constantly monitored and get feedback on their PD situation. Early PD symptoms can, therefore, be detected and the proper medication provided. In this framework, we use speech signals from clients captured from various sensors and transmitted to the cloud for processing. In the cloud, decisions are made using a support vector machine-based classifier. Decisions, along with the signal features, are sent to registered doctors, who then prescribe certain medications to the client. Several experiments were performed, with the results demonstrating that the proposed framework can achieve 97.2% accuracy in detecting PD.
