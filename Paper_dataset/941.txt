AB Due to the large amount of pollutant discharge, the environmental pollution capacity of the coastal waters of the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea in China is seriously overloaded, which has caused unacceptable impact on the marine ecological environment. Based on this, this paper is based on the cloud computing model of marine environmental management scientific decision-making evaluation algorithm, constructing a model of complex network dynamic correlation characteristics, and externally describing water bloom. Through the weight parameters in the cloud model, it is effectively applied to the evaluation of marine environmental management science decision support system. According to the complexity characteristics of cyanobacterial bloom management decision, the cyanobacteria bloom control decision model is inferred, and the intuitionistic fuzzy rough set algorithm is improved. The similarity is calculated, the best matching case is found, and the experts are adjusting to form a governance plan. The research results show that the scientific decision-making evaluation algorithm of marine environment management based on cloud computing model is effective for the verification of marine environmental management science decision support system evaluation system, embedding eutrophication evaluation method and cyanobacteria water bloom governance decision-making method into water quality remote monitoring and cyanobacteria water China's governance decision-making system, to achieve the decision-making of cyanobacteria bloom control in the lake water body.
