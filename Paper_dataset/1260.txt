AB The aging population and an unhealthy lifestyle have led to a considerable proportion of chronic diseases in many countries. A new generation of emerging technologies has set off a new wave of revolution around the world, such as cloud computing, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and so on. In recent years, the literature associated with chronic disease research driven by emerging technologies has grown rapidly, but a few studies have used bibliometrics and a visualization approach to conduct deep mining and reveal a panorama of this field. This paper is a bibliometric analysis of chronic disease research driven by emerging technologies, and this paper analyzed and visualized the time distribution, space distribution, literature co-citation, and research focus. Moreover, this paper visualized and determined the dynamic knowledge structure of chronic disease research driven by emerging technologies, which will be helpful in understanding the current research status and identifying the future research directions in this research field for e-health and medical informatics scholars.
