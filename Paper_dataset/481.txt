AB Virtual machine migration is used in cloud computing for server consolidation, system maintenance, opportunistic power savings, and load balancing. Scatter-Gather VM live migration is a new type of virtual machine migration. It is proposed to decouple the source quickly and reduce the time to evict the state of a migrating virtual machine from the host. In Scatter-Gather live migration, the memory pages of the VM are transferred not just to the destination but also to several pre-selected intermediaries. This open problem of selection of the intermediate nodes is not addressed in the literature. In this paper, we propose to define the problem of intermediate node selection in Scatter-Gather migration and prove that it is NP-complete. The problem is mathematically modelled as an integer programming problem based on two optimality criteria - minimizing eviction time and minimizing energy. Two heuristic algorithms - maximum-decrease-in-eviction-time and least-increase-in-energy are proposed to solve the problem and their performance is analyzed with respect to three parameters - eviction time, energy and total migration.
