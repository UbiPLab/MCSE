   Marginal Gain
AB The growing demand of users for video streaming services has brought huge challenges to the streaming media service system. The cooperative edge-cloud computing architecture that combines cloud computing and edge computing can effectively reduce the burden on streaming media service systems. The streaming content caching under the cooperative edge-cloud computing architecture is important to improve the quality of user service. Based on this, this paper proposed a cache strategy based on user mobility and content popularity. In this cache strategy, the Markov model is used to describe the user mobility, the multiple linear regression model is used for content popularity prediction, and the content caching operation is performed according to the user mobility and the content popularity. To reduce the load of edge servers and further improve the quality of user service, this paper proposed a content placement strategy based on marginal gain. In this content placement strategy, a content placement problem is established by considering the content access latency and the content placement cost. Then a content placement algorithm based on marginal gain is proposed to solve the content placement problem. The content placement operation is performed by analyzing the marginal gain brought by placing the contents on edge servers to achieve the optimal performance of content placement. The experimental results show that the proposed strategies can effectively improve the performance in terms of the cache hit ratio, the content access latency, the storage cost and the remote data access cost.
