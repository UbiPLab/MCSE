AB The burgeoning distribution of smartphone web applications based on various mobile environments is increasingly focusing on the performance of mobile applications implemented by JavaScript and HTML5 (Hyper Text Markup Language 5). If application software has a simple functional processing structure, then the problem is benign. However, browser loads are becoming more burdensome as the amount of JavaScript processing continues to increase. Processing time and capacity of the JavaScript in current mobile browsers are limited. As a solution, the Web Worker is designed to implement multi-threading. However, it cannot guarantee the computing ability as a native application on mobile devices, and is not sufficient to improve processing speed. The method proposed in this research overcomes the limitation of resources as a mobile client and guarantees performance by native application software by providing high computing service. It shifts the JavaScript process of a mobile device on to a cloud-based computer server. A performance evaluation experiment revealed the proposed algorithm to be up to 6 times faster in computing speed compared to the existing mobile browser's JavaScript process, and 3 to 6 times faster than Web Worker. In addition, memory usage was also less than the existing technology.
