AB Cloud computing infrastructures are designed to support the accessibility and availability of various services to consumers over the Internet. Data centers hosting Cloud applications consume massive amount of power, contributing to high carbon footprints to the environment. Hence, solutions are needed to minimize the energy consumption. This paper focuses on the development of a dynamic task scheduling algorithm by proposing an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model that minimizes the energy consumption in a Cloud data center. Furthermore, an Adaptive Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed to reflect the dynamic nature of the Cloud environment and to provide a near optimal scheduling solution that minimizes the energy consumption. The proposed adaptive GA is validated by simulating the Cloud infrastructure and conducting a set of performance and quality evaluation study in this environment. The results demonstrate that the proposed solution offers performance gains with regards to response time and in reducing energy consumption. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
