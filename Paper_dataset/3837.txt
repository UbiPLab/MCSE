AB With the cooperation between hospitals and advanced technologies such as mobile Internet, big data and cloud computing, emerging technologies and new service models have been applied in precaution, diagnosis, treatment and other medical services. As a result, people's medical practices have been dramatically changed. On the basis of activity theory and service supply chain, the paper discusses hospital's innovation in medical, health and care service by using cloud computing. It also explores the model and evolution of hospital's internal activity and external supply chain. Cases in this paper from the year 2000 till now are our secondary data related to the cloud service innovation in hospitals. The study adopts textual analysis to interpret and analyze the data. Then, in-depth interviews would be taken on the basis of analytical result. Through the above-mentioned process, we find that homogeneities between different cases include treatment service cloud ranking first, community as the main promoter, substantial service innovation being emphasized, care service cloud as future trend, service innovation featured client-service model, eight procedures for service supply chain, improvement of suppliers' self-design, and pluralism of medical care service etc. Differences of the cases include government policies versus industrial policies, multipoint distribution versus centralized organizational structure, regional institutionalization versus large-scale centralization, Substantive services application versus development of service value, market orientation versus industry orientation, service provider orientation versus service design orientation, physical customer versus invisible customer. In the end, the study offers relevant theories, management implications, and recommendations.
