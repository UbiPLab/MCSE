AB Data Deduplicationin plays one of he Tor roles in reducing the data storage cost required in the cloud. Data Deduplication is the process of compressing the data that are repeatedly stored; it helps maintaining the unique data by eliminating its duplicate, thus reducing the storage space. It reduces the storage space by checking the data size through its binary value of the data in the database and it checks with a database for similar data chunks and finally, it either deduplicates the data or rehydrates the data using the pointer by maintaining the index for the same. This paper presents a survey of different techniques that are used to deduplicate the data by compressing the storage space required for storing similar data in a cloud environment.
