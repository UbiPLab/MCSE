AB Big Data is a set of technologies based on NoSQL databases allowing scalability of volumes, numbers and types of data. The important companies in the IT sector nd these NoSQL systems, new solutions to respond to scalability needs. Multiple open-source and proprietary models of NoSQL are available on the market. Because of the large number and diversity of existing solutions, it is diffcult to select an appropriate solution for a specic problem. In this paper, we develop a comparative study about the performance of two solutions widely employed HBase and MongoDB, using the YCSB tool. The latter being a very powerful test tool, used in multiple evaluation works of NoSQL databases. The purpose is to provide assistance and support to actors interested of Big Data and Cloud Computing for eventual decisions for the choice of solutions to be adopted.
