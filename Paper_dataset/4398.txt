ID MANAGEMENT
AB This publication presents algorithms for protecting data from unauthorised access to it. A special role among information protection algorithms is played by algorithms of data splitting and sharing which allow the information to be distributed within a selected group of secret trustees. This paper describes protocols of the above type and also suggests a way of using the proposed solutions for linguistic information sharing. Linguistic message-sharing algorithms are described as a class of protocols for protecting data with its possible semantic interpretation. This is because the semantic analysis allows the content-based interpretation of various information sets. The proposed methods are very useful from different points of view. Authors would like to present one possible application which is cognitive service management and data-sharing systems applied for cloud computing.
