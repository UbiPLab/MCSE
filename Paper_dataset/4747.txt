AB Cloud computing provides platform for pay-per-use services, such as software, hardware, and platforms. Previous cloud frameworks use fix policies that do not have the functionality to upgrade services on demand when the user does not receive services according to Service Level Agreement (SLA). In addition, there was a lack of functionality to monitor external network and client device resources. This paper presents Quality of experience framework for Cloud computing (QoC) for monitoring the Quality of Experience (QoE) of the end user using video streaming services in the cloud computing environment. The management platform is used for administration purpose in QoC framework that provides facility to easily manage the cloud environment and provide services according to SLA via runtime policy change. The objective QoE/Quality of Service (QoS) section will automatically monitor the QoS data. It will also compare and analyze the subjective QoE submitted by the users and objective QoS data collected by agent-based framework for accurate QoE prediction and proper management. The proposed QoC framework has new features of real-time network monitoring and client device monitoring and allows changing policy in runtime environment, which to the best of our knowledge is currently not provided by existing frameworks.
