AB As a typical application of Internet of Things (IoT) in the field of transportation, Internet of Vehicles (IoV) aims at achieving an integrated intelligent transportation system to enhance traffics efficiency, avoid accidents, ensure road safety, and improve driving experiences by using new IoT technologies. Different from other Internet, it is characterized by dynamic topological structures, huge network scale, non-uniform distribution of nodes, and mobile limitation. Due to these characteristics, IoV systems face various types of attacks, such as authentication and identification attacks, availability attacks, confidentiality attacks, routing attacks, data authenticity attacks, etc., which result in several challenging requirements in security and privacy. Many security scientists made numerous efforts to ensure the security and privacy for the Internet of Vehicles in recent years. This paper aims to review the advances on issues of security and privacy in IoV, including security and privacy requirements, attack types, and the relevant solutions, and discuss challenges and future trends in this area.
