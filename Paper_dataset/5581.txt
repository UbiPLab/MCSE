AB Heavy data load and wide cover range have always been crucial problems for big data processing in Internet of Things (IoT). Recently, mobile-edge computing (MEC) and unmanned aerial vehicle base stations (UAV-BSs) have emerged as promising techniques in IoT. In this article, we propose a three-layer online data processing network based on the MEC technique. On the bottom layer, raw data are generated by distributed sensors with local information. Upon them, UAV-BSs are deployed as moving MEC servers, which collect data and conduct initial steps of data processing. On top of them, a center cloud receives processed results and conducts further evaluation. For online processing requirements, the edge nodes should stabilize delay to ensure data freshness. Furthermore, limited onboard energy poses constraints to edge processing capability. In this article, we propose an online edge processing scheduling algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization. In cases of low data rate, it tends to reduce edge processor frequency for saving energy. In the presence of a high data rate, it will smartly allocate bandwidth for edge data offloading. Meanwhile, hovering UAV-BSs bring a large and flexible service coverage, which results in a path planning issue. In this article, we also consider this problem and apply deep reinforcement learning to develop an online path planning algorithm. Taking observations of around environment as an input, a CNN network is trained to predict action rewards. By simulations, we validate its effectiveness in enhancing service coverage. The result will contribute to big data processing in future IoT.
