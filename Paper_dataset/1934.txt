AB Cloud computing can offer us different distance services over the internet. We propose an online application model for using health care systems that works by using cloud computing. It can provide a higher quality of services remotely and along with that, it decreases the cost of chronic patients. This model is composed of two sub-model, each of which uses a different service. One of these is software as a service (SaaS), which is user related, and the other one is Platform as a service (PaaS), that is engineer related. Doctors classify the chronic diseases into different stages according to their symptoms. As the clinical data has a non-numeric value, we use the fuzzy logic system in the Paas model to design this online application model. Based on this classification, patients can receive the proper recommendation through smart devices (SaaS model).
