AB This research has a purpose to study and design the system architecture for virtual team campus on Cloud to support the internal quality assurance of Rajamangala University of Technology. The research was divided into two steps as follows: 1) system architecture design and 2) system architecture assessment. The samples of this research consisted of 10experts involved in internal quality assurance and information and communication technology chosen by using a specific selection method. The assessment form was used as a research instrument to assess the system architecture for virtual team campus on Cloud to support internal quality assurance work of Rajamangala University of Technology. The statistics used in this study were Arithmetic Mean and Standard Deviation. The results of the research showed that the Cloud system architecture processing model in the form of software services which demonstrated the systems and modules that worked together under the context of Rajamangala University in internal quality assurance work in this research consisted of 2 main systems, 11 sub-modules that each system and module was important for system development. The assessment of the system architecture from experts found that the system architecture designed by the researcher was at very good level which showed that the architecture that the researcher has designed can be used to develop the system of virtual team campus on Cloud to support the internal quality assurance of Rajamangala University of Technology.
