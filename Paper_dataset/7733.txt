AB Traffic hotline discovery is necessary for rational and scientific urban transportation planning in the new living quarters and economic zones. Cloud of Things (CoT) is a newly emerging concept, involving with two advanced technologies, that is, Cloud Computing and Internet of Things (IoT). CoT provides promising opportunities for traffic hotline discovery. However, it is still a challenge to discover the traffic hotlines over CoT. In view of this challenge, a hotline discovery method over CoT by using big taxi GPS data is proposed in this paper. Specifically, a traffic hotline discovery principle is presented to provide a reference standard for the generalized traffic spots that need planning, and a corresponding hotline discovery method is proposed for traffic hotspot identification and hotline selection. To improve the scalability and efficiency of the proposed method in Big Data environment, the SAP HANA cloud is applied to implement the proposed method under two application scenarios. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is both effective and efficient. SoftwarePractice and Experience. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
