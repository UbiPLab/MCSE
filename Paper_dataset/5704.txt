AB Wireless sensor network (WSN) technologies have enabled ubiquitous sensing to intersect many areas of modern day living. The creation of these devices offers the ability to get, gather, exchange, and consume environmental measurement from the physical world in a communicating-actuating network, called the Internet of Things (IoT). As the number of physical world objects from heterogeneous network environments grows, the data produced by these objects raise uncontrollably, bringing a delicate challenge into scalability management in the IoT networks. Cloud computing is a much more mature technology, offering unlimited virtual capabilities in terms of storage capacity and processing power. Ostensibly, it seems that cloud computing and IoT are evolving independently on their own paths, but in reality, the integration of clouds with IoT will lead to deal with the inability to scale automatically depending on the overload caused by the drastic growth of the number of connected devices and/or by the huge amount of exchanged data in the IoT networks. In this paper, our objective is to promote the scalability management, using hybrid mechanism that will combine traffic-oriented mechanism and resources-oriented mechanism, with adaption actions. By the use of autonomic middleware within IoT systems, we seek to improve the monitoring components's architectural design, based on cloud computing-oriented scalability solution. The intention is to maximize the number of satisfied requests, while maintaining at an acceptable QoS level of the system performances (RTT of the system, RAM, and CPU of the middleware). In order to evaluate our solution performance, we have performed different scenarios testbed experiments. Generally, our proposed results are better than those mentioned as reference.
