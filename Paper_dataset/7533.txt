AB Service interactions in cloud computing usually take place in an anonymous environment making trust management a non-trivial aspect. The increased use of cloud services in today's highly computerized world unfolds an increasing need for trust management in cloud computing. The existing trust management systems which portrays a static trust relationship falls deficit when it comes to meeting up with the dynamic nature of cloud services. A dynamic evidence-based trust model is proposed to ascertain dynamic trustworthiness on services in the cloud environment. The trust model employs fuzzy logic to derive trust value in order to handle the uncertainty and uses induced ordered weight averaging operator to aggregate the trust values, thus enabling the real-time performance. The system makes use of QoS parameters as a substantiation to evaluate the trust for cloud services. The results in terms of efficiency and effectiveness of the model are demonstrated through simulations.
