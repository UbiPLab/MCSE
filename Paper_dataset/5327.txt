AB Public key encryption supporting equality test (referred to as PKE-ET) provides the capability of testing the equivalence between two messages encrypted under different public keys. Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is a promising primitive to achieve versatile and secure data sharing in the cloud computing by providing flexible one-to-many encryption. In this paper, we first initialize the concept of CP-ABE with equality test (CP-ABE-ET) by combining the notions of PKE-ET and CP-ABE. Using ABE-ET primitive, the receiver can delegate a cloud server to perform an equivalence test between two messages, which are encrypted under different access policies. During the delegated equivalence test, the cloud server is unable to obtain any knowledge of the message encrypted under either access policy. We propose a concrete CP-ABE-ET scheme using bilinear pairing and Viete's formulas, and give the security proof of the proposed scheme formally in the standard model. Moreover, the theoretic analysis and experimental simulation reveal that the proposed scheme is efficient and practical.
