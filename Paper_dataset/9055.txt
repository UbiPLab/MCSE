AB The advent of cloud computing technology has enabled users to invoke various web services in a "pay-as-you-go" manner. However, due to the flexible pricing model of web services in cloud environment, a cloud user' service invocation cost may be influenced by many factors (e.g., service invocation time), which brings a great challenge for cloud users' cost-effective web service invocation. In view of this challenge, in this paper, we first investigate the multiple factors that influence the invocation cost of a cloud service, for example, user's job size, service invocation time, and service quality level; and afterwards, a novel Cloud Service Cost Optimization Method named CS-COMis put forward, by considering the above multiple impact factors. Finally, a set of experiments are designed, deployed, and tested to validate the feasibility of our proposal in terms of cost optimization. The experiment results show that our proposed CS-COM method outperforms other related methods.
