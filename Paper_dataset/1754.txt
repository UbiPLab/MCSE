AB In order to detect surface deformations on the tower of offshore wind turbine model under ship impact, a surface deformation detection method based on the parallel stereovision model is proposed in the present paper. Combination usage of five constraint algorithms effectively adjust the disparity range and eliminate the false disparities in the disparity map, and accomplish the aim of disparity optimization. Based on the parallel stereovision model, 3D point clouds of deformable surface are computed and the deformable surfaces are reconstructed by Delaunay triangulation. Moreover, a stereovision measurement system used for detecting surface deformation is integrated based on MATLAB, the comparison experiments of distance measurement and a surface deformation detection test of offshore wind turbine model under ship impact are performed in lab. Experimental results show that 3D surface rebuilt by the proposed stereovision method can accurately reveal the surface deformation on the protective device of the wind turbine model under ship impact, verifying the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed stereovision method in the present paper.
