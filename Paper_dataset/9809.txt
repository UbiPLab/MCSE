   Security issues and data sharing
AB Data owners are used to transmit the data using cloud computing in a low cost. The cloud computing is a popular technology to transmit the data through internet and will also act as third party users. Data owners outsource the data through the cloud server, which have to encrypt the data before outsourcing due to the security and privacy issues. After encrypting the data, users have to find out the respective data using the private key. All information has to be stored in the cloud storage unit. To optimize the cloud storage unit, safety transmission, minimize the cost and searching time, here we have proposed a new scheme as searchable encrypted data file sharing technique. This technique will allocate a keyword for every data during the encryption based on which the keyword matching will accept the data of respective users. The multi keyword search is been proposed for keyword searching. Experimental results analyze the overall performance and the proposed scheme has not only increased the efficiency but also decreased the searching time.
