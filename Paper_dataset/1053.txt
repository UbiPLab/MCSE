AB The emergence of mobile cloud computing indicates that abundant applications such as mobile games are available. Clouds have many interesting characteristics including on demand service, measured service, scalable elastic service, "anytime, anywhere" network access in cloud networks. Benefit due to the service controlled by communication between objects is now being increased by people who use these services in real life. In a very large scale mobile gaming environment with limited wireless network bandwidth, the command that game users give should be reflected to the game immediately and should be transferred to several objects at once, and it takes a certain amount of time to get the command pass to other users. An efficient mechanisms for state update are crucial to allow graceful real time interaction for many players and limited network bandwidth. Therefore, we propose a scheme for an optimized state update based on event locking and analytical models for mobile game in this paper. We design and implement the gaming server applying to our proposed scheme. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the performance for mobile games and reduce communication overhead in cloud networks.
