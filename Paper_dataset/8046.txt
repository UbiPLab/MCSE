ID CARE
AB The exponentially growing healthcare costs coupled with the increasing interest of patients in receiving care in the comfort of their own homes have prompted a serious need to revolutionize healthcare systems. This has prompted active research in the development of solutions that enable healthcare providers to remotely monitor and evaluate the health of patients in the comfort of their residences. However, existing works lack flexibility, scalability, and energy efficiency. This article presents a pervasive patient health monitoring (PPHM) system infrastructure. PPHM is based on integrated cloud computing and Internet of Things technologies. In order to demonstrate the suitability of the proposed PPHM infrastructure, a case study for real-time monitoring of a patient suffering from congestive heart failure using ECG is presented. Experimental evaluation of the proposed PPHM infrastructure shows that PPHM is a flexible, scalable, and energy-efficient remote patient health monitoring system.
