AB The smartphone is a typical cyberphysical system (CPS). It must be low energy consuming and highly reliable to deal with the simple but frequent interactions with the cloud, which constitutes the cloud-integrated CPS. Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) has emerged as a critical technique to leverage power management by lowering the supply voltage and frequency of processors. In this paper, based on the DVS technique, we propose a novel Energy-aware Dynamic Task Scheduling (EDTS) algorithm to minimize the total energy consumption for smartphones, while satisfying stringent time constraints and the probability constraint for applications. Experimental results indicate that the EDTS algorithm can significantly reduce energy consumption for CPS, as compared to the critical path scheduling method and the parallelism-based scheduling algorithm.
