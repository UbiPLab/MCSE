AB While the number of cloud solutions is continuously increasing, the development and operation of large-scale and distributed cloud applications are still challenging. A major challenge is the lack of interoperability between the existing cloud solutions, which increases the complexity of maintaining and evolving complex applications potentially deployed across multiple cloud infrastructures and platforms. In this article, we show how the Cloud Modelling Framework leverages model-driven engineering and supports the DevOps ideas to tame this complexity by providing: (i) a domain-specific language for specifying the provisioning and deployment of multi-cloud applications, and (ii) a models@run-time environment for their continuous provisioning, deployment, and adaptation.
