AB Industry 4.0 enables the management of factories manufacturing products with complexity and flexibility. The corresponding logistic services must provide greater accuracy and efficiency in logistic operations. The Internet of Things (IoT) is an important aspect for smart logistics in the context of Industry 4.0. For instance, intelligent logistics models use IoT integrated technologies, e.g. radio frequency identification (RFID), wireless sensor network (WSN) and cloud computing, to enhance the traceability and decision supports of logistic processes in real-time speed, high accuracy, and flexibility. This research focuses on analyzing the related technology roadmaps for the adoption of IoT technologies in smart logistic services. A case research is conducted specifically to identify the relationship between IoT-oriented technologies and deployed advanced logistic services. The logistic operations are organized into an ontology schema based on a four level service framework. The research proposes a roadmap approach to visualize the patent allocations and evolutions corresponding to logistic services at each level. Although the patent roadmap methodology is generic, this research focuses on the two industry leaders, which are UPS and IBM. Using the roadmap methodology, the IoT enabled smart logistic patents are analyzed to identify technologyrelated business strengths and strategies.
