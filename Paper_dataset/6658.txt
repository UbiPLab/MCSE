AB Micro-cloud, as one kind of mobile cloud computing modes, can reduce network delay and alleviate resource constraint of mobile devices. In this mode, mobile devices use their idle resources to provide services for others. Due to the mobility, irregularity of mobile devices, the stability problem of micro-cloud environment still remains challenging. In order to increase the stability of micro-cloud and decrease network delay, the interest-related and location-aware micro-cloud topology is proposed in this paper. The interest-related mobile device nodes are classified into the same micro-cloud which can raise the probability of resource reuse. For reducing failed requests and enhancing the scalability of micro-cloud topology, both node location and node service capacity are considered. Moreover, the bacteria foraging-based offloading algorithm for interest-related micro-cloud topology is proposed, which is an energy-efficient and response time constraint offloading approach. The experiments are conducted and the experiment results show that the location-aware interest-related micro-cloud topology has better stability and scalability, while the bacteria foraging-based offloading algorithm performs better in terms of reducing response time and energy.
