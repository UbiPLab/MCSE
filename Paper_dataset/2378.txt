AB With the explosion in the number of connected devices and Internet of Things (IoT) services in smart city, the challenges to meet the demands from both data traffic delivery and information processing are increasingly prominent. Meanwhile, the connected vehicle networks have become an essential part in smart city, bringing massive data traffic as well as significant communication, caching, and computing resources. As the two typical services types in smart city, delay-tolerant and delay-sensitive traffic requires very different quality of service (QoS)/quality of experience (QoE), and could be delivered through the routes with different features to meet their QoS/QoE requirements with the lowest costs. In this paper, we propose a novel vehicle network architecture in the smart city scenario, mitigating the network congestion with the joint optimization of networking, caching, and computing resources. Cloud computing at the data centers as well as mobile edge computing at the evolved node Bs and on-board units are taken as the paradigms to provide caching and computing resources. The programmable control principle originated from the software-defined networking paradigm has been introduced into this architecture to facilitate the system optimization and resource integration. With the careful modeling of the services, the vehicle mobility, and the system state, a joint resource management scheme is proposed and formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process to minimize the system cost, which consists of both network overhead and execution time of computing tasks. Extensive simulation results with different system parameters reveal that the proposed scheme could significantly improve the system performance compared to the existing schemes.
