AB The possibilities for cybercriminals and the manifestations of cybercrime have significantly increased in recent years due to the digitalization and spread of internet-enabled devices. The term cybercrime describes criminal acts committed via internet, but there are numerous manifestations which are classified differently depending on the context of cybercrime. The prevalence of cybercrime is presented in the annual Federal Management Report of the German Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA). This report identifies challenges by, among others, new methods of distributing malware and identity theft. Ransomware, an increased danger potential from the Internet of things and attacks on so-called critical infrastructures must also be perceived as cybercriminal threats. In addition, sexually motivated crimes, such as child pornography, also spread faster in the virtual space. The German Police Crime Statistics for 2019 showed a 15.4% increase in cybercrime compared to the previous year. An increase in identity theft via platforms, such as darknet as well as a growing potential threat from developments, such as smart homes, cloud computing or big data is predicted. Empirical studies on the victimization experiences of cyberattacks are available for private individuals and industrial companies. The offenders were mostly young male adults.
