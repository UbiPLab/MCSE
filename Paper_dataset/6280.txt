AB Huge energy requirement of cloud data centers is prime concern. Dynamic Virtual Machine (VM) consolidation based on VM live migration to switched-off or put some of the under-loaded host Physical Machines (PMs) into a low power consumption mode can significantly save energy in data centers and achieve green cloud computing. Performance overheads imposed on source and destination hosts during and after VM live migration is the main focus of research. Existing VM consolidation approaches are inefficient regarding VM live migration time, application downtime, VM pre and post-migration overheads which results in Quality of Service (QoS) degradation. So, near-optimal solution which optimizes these overheads is main challenge. This paper discusses the causes of VM live migration performance overheads and comparison of different overhead optimization techniques on the basis of parameters like accuracy and migration cost. Pareto-Optimal solution is proposed to eliminate the VM performance overheads.
