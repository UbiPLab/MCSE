DE Cloud Computing; E-Healthcare; Deduplication
AB Cloud computing is an Internet-based computing which provides shared processing resources and data to computers and devices on demand. Cloud computing provide users with various capabilities to process their data in third party data centres. It has become a highly demanded service due to computing power, cheap cost for services offered, high performance and availability. Three benefits of cloud include self-servicing provisioning, elasticity, pay per use. Cloud computing services can be private, public and hybrid. Deduplication is a technique used to store files in the cloud. E- Healthcare system plays a major role in the society. It monitors the health condition and helps in giving appropriate medical treatments. This system aims at gathering and storing a patient's details and sharing health related information. Deduplication is used in E-Healthcare are system to avoid duplicated copies of patient data. Deduplication is a method used for eliminating redundant data and allows only one copy of the file to be stored. The more efficient use of disk space also allows for longer disk retention periods. Deduplication does not allow more than one copy of the file to be saved as it occupies most of the memory space. Deduplication initially compares the title of the available files and the file that is to be saved. If the title does not match with the available data, it then compares with the contents of the files that are available in cloud, if the content is also unique then the file is allowed to be stored in cloud. If either the title or the content is same then the file will be blocked from saving.
