AB With network slicing in 5G networks, Mobile Network Operators can create various slices for Service Providers (SPs) to accommodate customized services. Usually, the various Service Function Chains (SFCs) belonging to a slice are deployed on a best-effort basis. Nothing ensures that the Infrastructure Provider (InP) will be able to allocate enough resources to cope with the increasing demands of some SP. Moreover, in many situations, slices have to be deployed over some geographical area: coverage as well as minimum per-user rate constraints have then to be taken into account. This paper takes the InP perspective and proposes a slice resource provisioning approach to cope with multiple slice demands in terms of computing, storage, coverage, and rate constraints. The resource requirements of the various SFCs within a slice are aggregated within a graph of Slice Resource Demands (SRD). Infrastructure nodes and links have then to be provisioned so as to satisfy all SRDs. This problem leads to a Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation. A two-step approach is considered, with several variants, depending on whether the constraints of each slice to be provisioned are taken into account sequentially or jointly. Once provisioning has been performed, any slice deployment strategy may be considered on the reduced-size infrastructure graph on which resources have been provisioned. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to a more classical direct slice embedding approach.
