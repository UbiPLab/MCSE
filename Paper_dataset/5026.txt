AB This research aims to study intentions to switch toward cloud computing at firms' level. As a new way to deploy information technologies (IT) within firms, switching toward cloud computing remains a hard decision that depends on several contextual factors. While several studies have focused mainly on technological aspects, this research adopts a multidimensional perspective by combining the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework with a two-factor theory perspective. Doing so, the authors attempt to propose a research model that can be useful to deeply understand how firms perform when thinking about switching toward cloud-based solutions. A multiple-case study within five Tunisian firms has been conducted to contextualize the research model and give it more explanation power. The Tunisian context should be interesting, as cloud computing adoption is a new topic that is not sufficiently studied in developing countries, particularly in those characterized by an economy in transition. Data have been collected by semi-structured interviews and coded using the Nvivo software. The analysis of interviews content shows that the expected switching benefits and risks play a mediating role between TOE factors and intentions to switch toward cloud computing. Indeed, the authors found some different results within cases revealing the dual effects of technology, organization, and environment factors on intentions by generating different expected switching benefits and risks. In light of these results, some recommendations are proposed to decision makers in this area.
