AB Reliable measurements of the three-dimensional radial distribution function for cloud droplets are desired to help characterize microphysical processes that depend on local drop environment. Existing numerical techniques to estimate this three-dimensional radial distribution function are not well suited to in situ or laboratory data gathered from a finite experimental domain. This paper introduces and tests a new method designed to reliably estimate the three-dimensional radial distribution function in contexts in which (i) physical considerations prohibit the use of periodic boundary conditions and (ii) particle positions are measured inside a convex volume that may have a large aspect ratio. The method is then utilized to measure the three-dimensional radial distribution function from laboratory data taken in a cloud chamber from the Holographic Detector for Clouds (HOLODEC).
