ID NETWORKING
AB Software-defined networking (SDN) is rapidly transforming the networking ecosystem of cloud-computing datacenters. However, replicating SDN-enabled cloud infrastructures to conduct practical research in this domain requires a great deal of effort and capital expenditure. This article presents the CLOUDS-Pi platform, a small-scale cloud datacenter for doing research on software-defined clouds. As part of it, Open vSwitch is integrated with Raspberry-Pis, low-cost embedded computers, to build up a network of OpenFlow switches. The article provides two use cases and reports on validation and performance evaluation. It also discusses the benefits and limitations of CLOUDS-Pi in particular and SDN in general.
