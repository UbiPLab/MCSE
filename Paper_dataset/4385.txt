ID MATCHING ALGORITHM
AB Automaton or table-based multi-pattern matching methods have been widely used in cloud services, i.e., virtual Firewall service, virtual IDS service, etc. In cloud, a large scale of patterns in such services are frequently updated causing by users' joining or quitting and adjustment of security and management policies. Therefore, how to quickly and accurately update the Automaton and Table becomes an important issue. In this paper, we propose Eagle+, an incremental approach for updating the matching Automaton and Table whilst avoiding recalculating the whole patterns after each change. In Eagle+, we attain efficiency by computing only the latest update set of patterns when updating the Automaton and Table. Moreover, Eagle+ achieves accurately local updating based on three atomic operations, adding, updating and deleting, each of which modifies values on classical Aho-Corasick (AC) automaton, Set Backward Oracle Matching (SBOM) automaton and Wu-Manber (WM) table. Compared with existing pattern updating methods, Eagle+ reduces the computation complexity from O(n(2)) to 0(n). The experimental results show that Eagle+ can save nearly 72%-92% of the time consumption in updating automatons and perform 100X faster in WM table. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
