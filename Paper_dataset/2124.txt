AB The emergence of 5G technology has enabled a fast development of the wireless communication based on Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, edge and fog computing. The development has contributed to enhance the lifestyle of the citizens in smart cities. Different applications are provided with 5G technologies to solve problems of the citizens. In this article, we take advantage of the 5G technology to develop a framework of images' classification to satisfy consumers in smart cities. As a case, study, we develop an automatic date fruits classification system in the framework to satisfy date fruits consumers interest. In the proposed system, a deep learning approach is utilized with fine-tuning pre -trained models. The edge computing and caching are used to provide a low latency and real-time transmission of the date fruits' images. The experimental results show the viability of the proposed framework.
