AB Extracting high-quality building footprints is a basic requirement in multiple sectors of town planning, disaster management, 3D visualization, etc. In the current study, we compare three different techniques for acquiring building footprints using (i) LiDAR, (ii) object-oriented classification (OOC) applied on high-resolution aerial photographs and (iii) digital surface models generated from interpolated LiDAR point cloud data. The three outputs were compared with a digitized sample of building polygons quantitatively by computing the errors of commission and omission, and qualitatively using statistical operations. These findings showed that building footprints derived from OOC gave highest regression and correlation values with least commission error. The R-2 and R values (0.86 and 0.92, respectively) imply that the footprint areas derived by OOC matched more closely with the actual area of buildings, while a low commission error of 24.7% represented a higher number of footprints as correctly classified.
