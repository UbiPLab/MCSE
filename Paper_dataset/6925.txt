AB Recently, cloud computing and cyber-physical system (CPS) are definitely basic elements in real industrial field. In particular, security is a mandatory factor for communications and operations in these environments. However, the existing CPS security mechanism is not suitable to the telecommunication framework provided by the standards. In addition, random number function of high entropy must be used to enhance security with encrypted communications and must support perfect secrecy. Random number functions supported by the devices instead of servers do not have sufficient entropy. Entropy injection and seed replacement are also impractical. In this paper, we propose a security scheme which provides light-weight secure CPS information transmission and device control scheme in integration of CPS and cloud computing. In this scheme, a light-weight security scheme can multicast event information to users who have heterogeneous device information access authorities based on oneM2M standards, and also be able to manage the control devices. This paper provides performance analysis of proposed scheme and confirms its security and efficiency. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
