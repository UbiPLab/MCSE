AB This article addresses security and privacy issues associated with storing data in public cloud services. It presents an architecture based on a novel secure cloud gateway that allows client systems to store sensitive data in a semi-trusted multi-cloud environment while providing confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. This proxy system implements a space-efficient, computationally-secure threshold secret sharing scheme to store shares of a secret in several distinct cloud datastores. Moreover, the system integrates a comprehensive set of security measures and cryptographic protocols to mitigate threats induced by cloud computing. Performance in practice and code quality of the implementation are analyzed in extensive experiments and measurements. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
