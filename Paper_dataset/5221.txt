AB In the current scenario of cloud computing, heterogeneous resources are located in various geographical locations requiring security-aware resource management to handle security threats. However, existing techniques are unable to protect systems from security attacks. To provide a secure cloud service, a security-based resource management technique is required that manages cloud resources automatically and delivers secure cloud services. In this paper, we propose a self-protection approach in cloud resource management called SECURE, which offers self-protection against security attacks and ensures continued availability of services to authorized users. The performance of SECURE has been evaluated using SNORT. The experimental results demonstrate that SECURE performs effectively in terms of both the intrusion detection rate and false positive rate. Further, the impact of security on quality of service (QoS) has been analyzed.
