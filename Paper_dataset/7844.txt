AB Nowadays, in the panorama of Internet of Things (IoT), finding a right compromise between interactivity and security is not trivial at all. Currently, most of pervasive communication technologies are designed to work locally. As a consequence, the development of large-scale Internet services and applications is not so easy for IoT Cloud providers. The main issue is that both IoT architectures and services have started as simple but they are becoming more and more complex. Consequently, the web service technology is often inappropriate. Recently, many operators in both academia and industry fields are considering the possibility to adopt the eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) for the implementation of IoT Cloud communication systems. In fact, XMPP offers many advantages in term of real-time capabilities, efficient data distribution, service discovery and inter-domain communication compared to other technologies. Nevertheless, the protocol lacks of native security, data confidentiality and trustworthy federation features. In this paper, considering an XMPP-based IoT Cloud architectural model, we discuss how can be possible to enforce message signing/encryption and Single-Sign On (SSO) authentication respectively for secure inter-module and inter-domain communications in a federated environment. Experiments prove that security mechanisms introduce an acceptable overhead, considering the obvious advantages achieved in terms of data trustiness and privacy.
