AB Cloud manufacturing (CMfg), combining the idea and technologies of cloud computing and Internet of Things, is an emerging service-oriented manufacturing model. The supply-demand matching of manufacturing resources is one of the key technologies for implemention. However, resources in CMfg system are geographically distributed, functional of similar and dynamically changeable, and these features make it difficult to obtain higher accuracy for existing matching methods. In order to select the most satisfied resources in CMfg, a semantics-based supply-demand classification matching method (SDCM) is proposed. Firstly, the implementing framework of SDCM is constructed. Then, combined with the theories of ontology and dynamic description logic, a semantics-based SDCM algorithm is designed, which includes four implementation stages, respectively, basic information matching, IOPE parameters (Input, Outputs, Preconditions, Effects) matching, QoS (Quality of Service) matching and comprehensive matching. Finally, a case verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.
