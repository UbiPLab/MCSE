AB Cognitive radio (CR) is a novel technology for improving the utilization of radio electromagnetic spectrum. Recently, a new model called cognitive radio networks with cloud (CRNC) has been proposed to eliminate the constraints (pertinent to traditional CR) on power, memory space, and computational capacity. To enable multiple access of CRNC system, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing-interleave division multiple access (OFDM-IDMA) has been investigated. Traditional OFDM-IDMA may not be applied to CRNC in a straightforward manner. This is because the spectral nulling in CR and the subsequent spectral sensing mismatch (between CR transmitter and receiver) could lead to unacceptable data error performance. This paper presents a new multiple access communication system, called transform domain communication system IDMA communication system, to deal with spectral nulling problems. Two improved schemes based on BPSK and cyclic code shift keying modulations are proposed. The proposed system structure integrates the advantages of both OFDM-IDMA and CRNC, which can make full use of other users' information while satisfying CR constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the two proposed system architectures can achieve significant improvement on BER performance, multiple access capability, and anti-interference ability with spectral nulling.
