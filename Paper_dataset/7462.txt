AB The e-assessment, as an important part of any e-learning system, faces the same challenges and problems such as problems related to portability, reusability, adaptability, integration and interoperability. Therefore, we need an approach aiming to generate a general process of the e-assessment. The present study consists of the development of a generic e-assessment process which should be adapted to any learner profile. This e-assessment process is implemented as a composite cloud service which could be invoked by any existing LMS regardless of its environment. The authors are brought the abstraction defined by a workflow about proposing a development approach based on the Reverse Engineering and the cloud environment. To attempt these goals, they have studied the e-assessment politics of different existing LMSs to generate their e-assessment activities. These activities composing the generic e-assessment process using the Reverse Engineering and based on a set of mapping rules. Then, the authors have proposed a pedagogical scenario linking the generated, e-activities in an abstract manner using the concept of workflow. To specify this e-assessment workflow process, they use UML activity diagram language. Finally, to implement their approach, the authors have used the technology of cloud computing services
