AB Motivated by the interference of appendages in airline baggage dimension detection using three-dimensional (3D) point cloud, a minimum elastic bounding box (MEBB) algorithm for dimension detection of 3D objects is developed. The baggage dimension measurements using traditional bounding box method or shape fitting method can cause large measurements due to the interference of appendages. Starting from the idea of ` enclosing', an elastic bounding box model with the deformable surface is established. On the basis of using principal component analysis to obtain the main direction of the bounding box, the elastic rules for deformable surfaces are developed so as to produce a large elastic force when it comes into contact with the main body part and to produce a small elastic force when it comes into contact with the appendages part. The airline baggage measurement shows how to use MEBB for dimension detection, especially for the processing of isotropic density distribution, the elasticity computing and the adaptive adjustment of elasticity. Results on typical baggage samples, comparisons to other methods, and error distribution experiments with different algorithm parameters show that the authors' method can reliably obtain the size of the main body part of the object under the interference of appendages.
