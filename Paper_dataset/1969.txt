AB With the advent of artificial intelligence, machine learning has been well explored and extensively applied into numerous fields, such as pattern recognition, image processing and cloud computing. Very recently, machine learning hosted in a cloud service has gained more attentions due to the benefits from the outsourcing paradigm. Based on cloud-aided computation techniques, the heavy computation tasks involved in machine learning process can be off-loaded into the cloud server in a pay-per-use manner, whereas outsourcing large-scale collection of sensitive data risks privacy leakage since the cloud server is semi-honest. Therefore, privacy preservation for the client and verification for the returned results become two challenges to be dealt with. In this paper, we focus on designing a novel privacy-preserving single-layer perceptron training scheme which supports batch patterns training and verification for the training results on the client side. In addition, adopting classical secure two-party computation method, we design a novel lightweight privacy-preserving predictive algorithm. Both two participants learns nothing about other's inputs, and the calculation result is only known by one party. Detailed security analysis shows that the proposed scheme can achieve the desired security properties. We also demonstrate the efficiency of our scheme by providing the experimental evaluation on two different real datasets.
