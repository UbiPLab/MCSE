AB The performance of task scheduling algorithm in cloud computing determines the performance of the cloud system. This study mainly analyzed the application of the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm in the cloud task scheduling. In order to solve the problem of cloud task scheduling, the ABC algorithm was discretized to get the discrete artificial bee colony (DABC) algorithm. Then the mathematical model of cloud task scheduling was established and solved by the DABC algorithm. Finally, the simulation experiment was carried out, and the performance of first-come-first-served (FCFS), MIN-MIN, ABC and DABC algorithms under different cloud tasks was compared to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results showed that the user waiting time of the DABC algorithm was 1210s, the load balance degree was 0.01, and the user payment fee was 1688 yuan when the number of cloud tasks was 500; compared with other algorithms, the user waiting time of the DABC algorithm was shorter, the resource load balance degree was higher, and the overall performance was better. The research results verify the effectiveness of the DABC algorithm in solving the problem of cloud task optimal scheduling, and it can be further extended and applied in practice.
