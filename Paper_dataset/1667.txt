AB Mobile cloud computing (MCC) allows mobile users to have on-demand access to cloud services. A mobile cloud model helps in analyzing the information regarding the patients' records and also in extracting recommendations in healthcare applications. In MCC, a fine-grained level access control of multiserver cloud data is a prerequisite for successful execution of end-users applications. In this paper, we propose a new scheme that provides a combined approach of fine-grained access control over cloud-based multiserver data along with a provably secure mobile user authentication mechanism for the Healthcare Industry 4.0. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed scheme is the first to pursue fine-grained data access control over multiple cloud servers in a MCC environment. The proposed scheme has been validated extensively in differ-ent heterogeneous environment where its performance was found good in comparison to other existing schemes.
