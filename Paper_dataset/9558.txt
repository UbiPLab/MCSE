AB Toyota City Low-carbon Society Verification Project was a large-scale social system demonstration project that was held between 2010 and 2014 at Toyota City, Aichi, Japan. The goal of the project was to verify that the realization of a low-carbon society can be facilitated by introducing leading-edge devices and technologies such as smartphones, tablets, big data, cloud computing, machine-to-machine (M2M), and the Internet of Things (IoT). These devices and technologies made it possible to collect information on electricity usage and electrical device status from society as frequently as every minute. The collected data was stored for analysis and then the results were fed back to society in the form of behavior support information, or as control signals to control electrical devices remotely. This paper presents Fujitsu's approaches towards the development and demonstration of a community energy management system (CEMS) that utilizes the IoT, a system which is critical for the realization of sustainable low carbon societies.
