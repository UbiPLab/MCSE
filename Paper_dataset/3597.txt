AB This article describes how the enormous potential benefits provided by the cloud services, made enterprises to show huge interest in adopting cloud computing. As the service provider has control over the entire data of an organization stored onto the cloud, a malicious activity, whether internal or external can tamper with the data and computation. This causes enterprises to lack trust in adopting services due to privacy, security and trust issues. Despite of having such issues, the consumer has no root level access right to secure and check the integrity of procured resources. To establish a trust between the consumer and the provider, it is desirable to let the consumer to check the procured platform hosted at provider side for safety and security. This article proposes an architectural design of a trusted platform for the IaaS cloud computing by the means of which the consumer can check the integrity of a guest platform. TCG's TPM is deployed and used on the consumer side as the core component of the proposed architecture and it is distributed between the service provider and the consumer.
