AB In this work we present an approach aimed at maximizing the global QoS perceived within a large-scale federation of computing infrastructures. This approach exploits the combination of (1) a trust model for a network of software agents, designed to assist federated computing nodes, and (ii) a decentralized procedure which leads to the formation of coalitions between them. The proposed solution is based on a generic SLA-based federated architecture and the concept of "Global Capital" which reflects the global QoS offered by the federation. Finally, a number of experimental trials prove that, by means of the proposed approach, the Global Capital improves. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
