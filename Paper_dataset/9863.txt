AB Mobile devices are increasingly becoming famous in the current times. Limited computing resources are still a hindrance for resource intensive computations. Several frameworks have been established to enable cloud -based mobile augmentation (CMA) approach be followed by mobile applications. CMA has a strategy of dynamic outsourcing resource intensive tasks to the external resources. CMA's state of art mobile augmentation model employs resource-rich clouds to increase, enhance and optimize mobile device. Augmented mobile devices in the cloud are geared towards extensive computations and storage of big data beyond the device capabilities with little or no traceable footprint and vulnerabilities. CMA has made efforts towards exploiting various cloud-based computing resources especially the distant clouds and proximate mobile nodes to augment mobile devices. Task scheduling is one of the approaches that are well elaborated using computations in this paper that is employed to reduce execution time.
