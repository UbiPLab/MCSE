AB To address the issue of cloud mixed workloads scheduling which might lead to system load imbalance and efficiency degradation in cloud computing, a novel cloud task staggering peak scheduling policy based on the task types and the resource load status is proposed. First, based on different task characteristics, the task sequences submitted by the user are divided into queues of different types by the fuzzy clustering algorithm. Second, the Performance Counters (PMC) mechanism is introduced to dynamically monitor the load status of resource nodes and respectively sort the resources by the metrics of Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, and input/output (I/O) load size, so as to reduce the candidate resources. Finally, the task sequences of specific type are scheduled for the corresponding light loaded resources, and the resources usage peak is staggered to achieve load balancing. The experimental results show that the proposed policy can balance loads and improve the system efficiency effectively and reduce the resource usage cost when the system is in the presence of mixed workloads.
