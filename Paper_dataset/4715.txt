AB On-premise file synchronization and sharing services are increasingly used in research collaborations and academia. The main motivation for the on-premise deployment is connected with the requirements on the physical location of the data, data protection policies and integration with existing computing and storage infrastructure in the research labs. In this work we present a benchmarking and monitoring framework for file synchronization and sharing services. It allows service providers to monitor the operational status of their services, understand the service behavior under different load types and with different network locations of the synchronization clients. The framework is designed as a monitoring and benchmarking tool to provide performance and robustness metrics for interconnected file synchronization and sharing services such as Open Cloud Mesh.
