AB Cybersecurity attacks resulting in loss of availability of cloud services can have significantly higher impact than those in the traditional stand-alone enterprise setups. Therefore, availability attacks, such as Denial of Service attacks (DoS); Distributed DoS attacks (DDoS) and Economical Denial of Sustainability (EDoS) attacks receive increasingly more attention. This paper surveys existing DDoS attacks analyzing the principles, ways of launching and their variants. Then, current mitigation systems are critically discussed. Based on the identification of the weak points, the paper proposes a new mitigation system named as DDoS-Mitigation System (DDoS-MS) that attempts to overcome the identified gap. The proposed framework is evaluated, and an enhanced version of the proposed system called Enhanced DDoS-MS is presented. In the end, the paper presents some future directions of the proposed framework.
