AB We present ADIOS 2, the latest version of the Adaptable Input Output (I/O) System. ADIOS 2 addresses scientific data management needs ranging from scalable I/O in supercomputers, to data analysis in personal computer and cloud systems. Version 2 introduces a unified application programming interface (API) that enables seamless data movement through files, wide-area-networks, and direct memory access, as well as high-level APIs for data analysis. The internal architecture provides a set of reusable and extendable components for managing data presentation and transport mechanisms for new applications. ADIOS 2 bindings are available in C++11, C, Fortran, Python, and Matlab and are currently used across different scientific communities. ADIOS 2 provides a communal framework to tackle data management challenges as we approach the exascale era of supercomputing. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
