AB The Internet of Things (IoT) envisions a multitude of heterogeneous objects and interactions with the physical environment and in the same time requires software architectures that are able to deal with a large amount of information, queries and computation. This paper presents a semantic modelling approach for addressing the functionalities provided by these objects in an IoT framework. In particular, the paper focuses on RFID networks integration by using dedicated association mechanisms, and proposes solutions for solving important issues such as enabling high level semantic interoperability, developing RFID middleware for providing identification, authentication, validation, monitoring of IoT devices and of encapsulated "real-world services, ensuring compatibility with standards and managing specific applications. As a novelty, the paper brings in a framework for developing solutions for lifecycle management of assets, which includes a three-tier architecture using algorithms of artificial intelligence to facilitate the association of context-aware systems with intelligent IoT devices.
