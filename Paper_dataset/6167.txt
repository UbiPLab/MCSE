AB It has been challenging to select suitable services from abundant candidates in cloud environment. Aiming to the characteristics of batch computing mode and stream computing mode, a novel trustworthy service selection approach is proposed integrating cloud model and interval numbers theory. To facilitate potential users to understand the quality of service, the trustworthiness of service is described with interval number using reverse cloud generator, and the services with poor performance are filtered out by employing deviation degree or proximity degree. Two formulas of possibility degree of interval numbers are designed to compare the trustworthiness values between cloud services by utilizing probability zone analysis and geometrical analysis respectively, and the ranking method for possibility degree of interval numbers is exploited to select the most trustworthy service. The experiments show that this approach is effective to improve the accuracy of service selection and select trustworthy service for potential users in cloud paradigm.
