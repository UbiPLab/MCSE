ID RESOURCE-ALLOCATION
AB Mobile devices may offload their applications to a virtual machine running on a cloud host. This application may fork new tasks which require virtual machines of their own on the same physical machine. Achieving satisfactory performance level in such a scenario requires flexible resource allocation mechanisms in the cloud data center. In this paper we present two such mechanisms which use prioritization: one in which forked tasks are given full priority over newly arrived tasks, and another in which a threshold is established to control the priority so that full priority is given to the forked tasks if their number exceeds a predefined threshold. We analyze the performance of both mechanisms using a Markovian multiserver queueing system with two priority levels to model the resource allocation process, and a multi-dimensional Markov system based on a Birth-Death queueing system with finite population, to model virtual machine provisioning. Our performance results indicate that the threshold-based priority scheme not only performs better, but can also be tuned to achieve the desired performance level.
