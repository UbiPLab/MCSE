AB For the purpose of supporting the design and analysis of enterprise application architecture, here, we report a tailored enterprise application architecture description framework and its corresponding design method. The presented framework can effectively support service-oriented architecting and cloud computing by creating the metadata model based on architecture content framework (ACF), DoDAF metamodel (DM2) and Cloud Computing Modelling Notation (CCMN). The framework also makes an effort to extend and improve the mapping between The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) application architectural inputs/outputs, deliverables and Department of Defence Architecture Framework (DoDAF)-described models. The roadmap of 52 DoDAF-described models is constructed by creating the metamodels of these described models and analysing the constraint relationship among metamodels. By combining the tailored framework and the roadmap, this article proposes a service-oriented enterprise application architecture development process. Finally, a case study is presented to illustrate the results of implementing the tailored framework in the Southern Base Management Support and Information Platform construction project using the development process proposed by the paper.
