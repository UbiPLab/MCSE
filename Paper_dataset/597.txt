AB An electron cloud spectroscopy system consisting of a microring and Bragg grating Fabry-Perot is proposed. It has the form of a Panda-ring formed by an add-drop filter with nonlinear two-phase modulators. The input light of 1.50 mu m center wavelength is fed into the system. By using suitable two-phase modulator parameters, the whispering gallery mode (WGM) of light is formed at the center ring. The gold plate at the center microring illuminated by light leads to electron cloud oscillations forming the electron density that results in the spin up and spin down of electrons. The electron cloud spins (spin up and spin down) form the qubits which can be transmitted to the Fabry-Perot sensing unit by the spin waves. The Fabry-Perot sensing unit measures the spectral profile of the electron cloud spins. To observe the spectral profile of the electron cloud spins a large bandwidth is employed. The space-time function is applied to distinguish the electron cloud spins, which leads to having the selected spin switching time and sensor sensitivity resolution. By varying the input power and the gold grating gaps, the change in optical path difference formed in terms of the electron cloud spins at the center ring, where the optimum of similar to 10Pbit is obtained. Both the reflection and transmission schemes of the microring Fabry-Perot circuit have bit rates of similar to 6Pbits(-1). The reflection and transmission spectra have a free spectral range of similar to 0.04-0.14 mu m. The optimum sensitivity of the microring Fabry-Perot sensor is 0.31 mu m(-1).
