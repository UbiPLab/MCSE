AB With the progress of cloud computing, more users are attracted by its strong and cost-effective computation potentiality. Nevertheless, whether Cloud Service Providers can efficiently protect Cloud Users data confidentiality (DC) remains a demanding issue. The CU may execute several applications with multicast needs. In Cloud different techniques were used to provide DC with multicast necessities. In this work, we aim at ensuring DC in the cloud. This is achieved using a two-step technique, called Fat Tree Data Confidential Recurrent Neural Network (FT-DCRNN) in a cloud environment. The first step performs the construction of Fat Tree based on Multicast model. The aim to use Fat Tree with Multicast model is that the multicast model propagates traffic on multiple links. With the Degree Restrict Multicast Fat Tree construction algorithm using a reference function, the minimum average between two links is measured. With these measured links, multicast is said to be performed that in turn improves the throughput and efficiency of cloud service. Then, with the objective of providing DC for the multi-casted data or messages, DCRNN model is applied. With the Non-linear Recurrent Neural Network using Logistic Activation Function, by handling complex non-linear relationships, average response time is said to be reduced.
