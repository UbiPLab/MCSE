AB Cloud Computing offers services over the Internet to support business processes, based on deployment models and service, meet business requirements in an efficient and cost-effective. A general context of the types of service models that it, as well as the models of deployment, are not known, so the following research questions are stated: Q1) How many studies refer to service models in Cloud Computing and Models of cloud computing deployment?, Q2) How the service models are classified in relation to the types of capabilities Application, Infrastructure y Platform in a Cloud?, and Q3) What types of cloud computing deployment models currently exist?. The objective of this paper is to investigate the service and deployment models that currently exist in cloud computing, for every which a process of systematic review of the literature has been used as a research methodology. The results show that 45 service models and 4 deployment models were found in Cloud Computing, this allows us to conclude that the offered models give a lot and diverse solutions for the business processes.
