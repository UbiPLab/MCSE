AB The growth and development of the information and communication technology industry has led to a rapid rise in big data applications. With the development of cloud data centers, cloud computing serves as an appropriate approach for delivering services to these applications. Such centers are equipped with a large number of servers which consume high energy and thus energy efficiency has become a major concern. To achieve sustainability, it is imperative to construct green data centers. This paper surveys big data applications and related challenges in the cloud environment. Energy efficiency has been recognised as the prime concern, and the techniques to achieve it have been categorised as infrastructure, storage, analytical, networking, scheduling and hybrid. The limitations in each energy saving techniques have been discussed. The importance of performance parameters, along with the energy efficiency, has been highlighted. The article has been concluded with valuable insights for future enhancements.
