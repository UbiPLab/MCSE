DE Hierarchical network; Hierarchical optimization; Cloud service
AB With limited homogeneous and heterogeneous resources in cloud computing system, it is not feasible to successively expand network infrastructure to adequately support the rapid growth in cloud service. In this paper, an approach for optimal transmission of hierarchical network for heterogeneous service in Cloud Scenarios was presented. Initially, the theoretical optimal transmission model of common network was transformed into hierarchical network with upper and lower optimization transmission model. Furthermore, the computation simplification and engineering transformation were presented for an approximation method at the low cost of computational complexity. In the final section, the average delay in engineering method shows its influence on the capability of access for common nodes.
