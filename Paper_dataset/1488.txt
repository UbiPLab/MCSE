AB The proposed work concentrates on the networking facets of sensor-cloud infrastructures-one of the first attempts of its kind. In a sensor-cloud, multiple sets of physical sensor nodes that are activated based on an application demand, in turn give rise to multiple distinct virtual sensors (VSs). The VSs are considered to span across multiple geographical regions; thereby, depositing the data (from each of the VS) to the closest cloud data center (DC). Quite obviously, multiple geospatial DCs get involve with an application. However, the principle of sensor-cloud is to store and conglomerate the data from various VSs, before they can be provisioned as Sensors-as-a-Service (Se-aaS). The assortation of data occurs within a single Virtual Machine (VM) (or in some cases multiple VMs) residing inside a particular DC. This work addresses the problem of scheduling a particular DC that congregates data from various VSs, and transmit the same to the end-user application. The work follows the general pairwise choice framework of the Optimal Decision Rule. The scheduling of the DC is performed under several network constraints, such as data migration cost, data delivery cost, and service delay of an application that ensures the preservation of the Quality-of-Service (QoS) and maintenance of the user satisfaction. The work quantifies the effective QoS of Se-aaS and determines an optimal decision rule for electing a particular DC. While arriving at a collective decision, the work incorporates the fallible decision making ability of a DC; thereby, excluding the loss of generality. Experimental results depict that the proposed algorithm for generating the optimal decision rule finds applicability in real-time cloud computing scenarios.
