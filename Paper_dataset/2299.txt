AB Cloud computing provides organizations the dynamic capability to deploy applications quickly on self-provision development platforms. In adopting a cloud-computing paradigm, the software development process leverages the use of cloud native features. This article highlights a cloud-based health insurance solution that enables consumers to purchase packages online with the objective of identifying attributes in the context of the development process while analyzing the association among the attributes. Exploratory factor analysis is used to identify the latent attributes. Their associations, in terms of causal relationship analysis, are investigated via DEMATEL. Results of factor analysis imply that agility, availability and adaptability are the underlying factors for cloud application development. The findings of the DEMATEL reveal that co-creative and collaborative development process, which embrace quick discovery and assembly of services in the cloud, are significant attributes that influence other attributes within the context of the cloud-based software development process.
