AB With recent advancements in wireless smart terminal manufacture and communication technologies, a huge amount of data are generated from a variety of sources including software applications and hardware devices. To make the most of big data, cloud computing can be exploited to store, share, and process the data. However, data privacy issues are still significantly challenging in practice where users' secrets may be leaked because of diverse software vulnerabilities and hardware attacks. In this paper, to address the above security challenge of big data, we propose an efficient and secure big data storage system in cloud computing, in which a leakage-resilient encryption scheme serves as the main ingredient. What's more, our formal security proofs analysis indicates that the proposed scheme can ensure users' data privacy even if the partial key is leaked in cloud computing. Finally, the leakage resilience analysis indicates that the leakage ratio in our scheme can reach roughly 1/3 and is higher than other schemes. Performance comparisons show the practicability of our scheme for big data security in cloud computing.
