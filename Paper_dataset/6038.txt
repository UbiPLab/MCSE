AB Mobile cloud computing (MCC) is becoming one of the primary applications and research directions of pervasive computing. Previous studies generally focuses on the following two kinds of paradigms. One is that mobile users offload computing tasks into traditional clouds to achieve collaboration processing. The other is that multiple mobile devices, as "helpers", casually provide computing services for other mobile "requesters". However, with the extraordinary development of mobile devices, new problems of resource utilization and multi-tenancy of mobile devices are emerging. Based on this, we propose a novel MCC paradigm combining virtual machine (VM) technologies to improve the resource utilization of mobile devices, achieve multi-tenancy and thereby obtain the more efficient MCC environment as well as a broader MCC research field. To achieve it, the VM deployment problem must be addressed firstly. The heuristic deployment approach VD-ABC based on an improved artificial bee colony algorithm is proposed. It combines with Boltzmann selection policy, to obtain the optimal solution of VM deployment. In terms of the traits of wireless network in MCC, the mapping from the obtained solution to the final VM deployment is achieved. Simulation results show that VD-ABC has a better energy saving performance while minimizing the service response latency.
