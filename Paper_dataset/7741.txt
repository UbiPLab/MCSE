AB Propargyl alcohol (HC2CH2OH, PA) has yet to be observed in the interstellar medium (ISM) although one of its stable isomers, propenal (CH2CHCHO), has already been detected in Sagittarius B2(N) with the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope in the frequency range 18 -26 GHz. In this paper, we investigate the formation of propargyl alcohol along with one of its deuterated isotopomers, HC2CH2OD (OD-PA), in a dense molecular cloud. Various pathways for the formation of PA in the gas and on ice mantles surrounding dust particles are discussed. We use a large gas-grain chemical network to study the chemical evolution of PA and its deuterated isotopomer. Our results suggest that gaseous HC2CH2OH can most likely be detected in hot cores or in collections of hot cores such as the star-forming region Sgr B2(N). A simple LTE (Local thermodynamic equilibrium) radiative transfer model is employed to check the possibility of detecting PA and OD-PA in the millimeter-wave regime. In addition, we have carried out quantum chemical calculations to compute the vibrational transition frequencies and intensities of these species in the infrared for perhaps future use in studies with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).
