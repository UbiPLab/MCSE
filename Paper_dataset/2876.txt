AB Due to the rapid development and popularity of the Internet, cloud computing has become an indispensable application service. However, how to assign various tasks to the appropriate service nodes is an important issue. Based on the reason above, an efficient scheduling algorithm is necessary to enhance the performance of the system. Therefore, a Three-Layer Cloud Dispatching (TLCD) architecture is proposed to enhance the performance of task scheduling. In the first layer, the tasks need to be distinguished into different types by their characters. Subsequently, the Cluster Selection Algorithm is proposed to dispatch the tasks to appropriate service clusters in the second layer. Besides this, a new scheduling algorithm is proposed in the third layer to dispatch the task to a suitable server in a server cluster to enhance the scheduling efficiency. Basically, the best task completion time can be obtained in our TLCD architecture. Furthermore, load balancing and reliability can be achieved under a cloud computing network environment.
