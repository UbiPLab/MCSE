AB With the popularity of cloud computing, many data owners outsource their graph data to the cloud for cost savings. The cloud server is not fully trusted and always wants to learn the owners' contents. To protect the information hiding, the graph data have to be encrypted before outsourcing to the cloud. The adjacent vertex search is a very common operation, many other operations can be built based on the adjacent vertex search. A boolean adjacent vertex search is an important basic operation, a query user can get the boolean search results. Due to the graph data being encrypted on the cloud server, a boolean adjacent vertex search is a quite difficult task. In this paper, we propose a solution to perform the boolean adjacent vertex search over encrypted graph data in cloud computing (BASG), which maintains the query tokens and search results privacy. We use the Gram-Schmidt algorithm and achieve the boolean expression search in our paper. We formally analyze the security of our scheme, and the query user can handily get the boolean search results by this scheme. The experiment results with a real graph data set demonstrate the efficiency of our scheme.
