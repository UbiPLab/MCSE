AB The traditional information resource sharing model of coastal city library has slow response time in resource sharing, so an information resource sharing model of coastal city library based on cloud computing is designed. By making the matching rules of association data, the close correlation degree of heterogeneous digital resources are calculated. Considering the data density, the information resources of coastal city library are collected. On this basis, the data is integrated and collected and the information of coastal city library is managed, such us the operations of resource downloading and uploading, so as to complete the information resource sharing of coastal city library based on cloud computing. The experiment shows that, in the case of less and more shared resources, the sharing time of the information resource sharing model of the coastal city library based on cloud computing is less than that of the traditional model, which can meet the needs of information resource sharing.
