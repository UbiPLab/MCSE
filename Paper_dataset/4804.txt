AB Cloud computing is a fascinating and profitable area in modem distributed computing. Aside from providing millions of users the means to use offered services through their own computers, terminals, and mobile devices, cloud computing presents an environment with low cost, simple user interface, and low power consumption by employing server virtualisation in its offered services (e.g., Infrastructure as a Service). The pool of virtual machines found in a cloud computing data centre (DC) must run through an efficient task scheduling algorithm to achieve resource utilisation and good quality of service, thus ensuring the positive effect of low energy consumption in the cloud computing environment. In this paper, we present an energy-efficient scheduling algorithm for a cloud computing DC using the dynamic voltage frequency scaling technique. The proposed scheduling algorithm can efficiently reduce the energy consumption for executing jobs by increasing resource utilisation. GreenCloud simulator is used to simulate our algorithm. Experimental results show that, compared with other algorithms, our algorithm can increase server utilisation, reduce energy consumption, and reduce execution time.
