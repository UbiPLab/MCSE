AB Labor demand has been one of the core issues of labor economics. Reasonable analysis and utilization of labor can improve labor structure and regional and national industrial structure. This can effectively reduce unemployment and increase overall productivity and gross domestic product. Marine and fishery resources are very important for modern societies, and the demand for labor has a very strong seasonality with fishery production. Therefore, it is important to reasonably and accurately predict and judge the trends of labor demand. Previous research theories have focused on qualitative analysis, but quantitative analysis of labor demand is rare. Based on the mobile Internet big data and cloud computing methods, a fuzzy system model for the prediction of marine labor demand was established in this study. Using vector data, the model was improved, and then the model was used to predict the marine labor demand in a certain area, and a good prediction effect was obtained.
