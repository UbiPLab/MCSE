AB An increasing amount of attention worldwide has been diverted into using Building Information Modeling (BIM) tools and simulations via BIM models in the field of architecture. BIM modeling and the effective use of various types of numerical and quantitative simulation and analysis are used throughout architectural processes. Stakeholders of various parties can be better informed about projects and may offer their feedback in a more effective and rapid manner to foster better, but also speedy, decision-making, hence this type of technology is so important. In this paper, various types of software and solutions based on Information Modeling (IM) and Virtual Reality (VR) are utilized in the design of a company dormitory. Simulations via a BIM model are performed and a cloud-based 3D Virtual Reality is used for consensus building. This paper examines the detailed process of the project, the effectiveness of feedback on the design, and the process of reaching consensus. In addition to what has already been done or what is currently available, this paper also presents a summary of what will be offered in the future in terms of BIM modeling, environment simulation, and VR simulation, collectively.
