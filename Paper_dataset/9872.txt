AB Cloud computing provides a centralized pool of configurable computing resources and computing outsourcing mechanisms that enable different computing services to different people in a way similar to utility based systems. Job scheduling algorithm achieves a high performance computing and the best system throughput. The scheduling problem can be solved by enumeration method, heuristic method or approximation method. In this work, a heuristic method is proposed for optimizing scheduling in cloud. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) refers to a population-based meta-heuristic algorithm that is inspired by the social behavior of populations with collaborative properties. Cuckoo Search (CS) is a new and efficient population-based heuristic evolutionary algorithm for solving optimization problems. CS has the advantages of simple implementation and few control parameters. In this paper, scheduling is performed based on hybrid PSO with CS algorithm. Results show that the proposed method performs better in terms of average schedule length and ratio of successful execution.
