AB Cloud computing is a technology for providing services over the Internet. It gives approach to renting IT infrastructures on a short-term pay-per-usage basis. One of the service provider's goals is to use the resources efficiently and gain maximum profit. Cloud processes a huge amount of data, so tasks scheduling is a vital role in the cloud computing. The purpose of this paper is to propose a method based on chaos theory and bat algorithm for task scheduling in Cloud computing. Task scheduling is a core and challenging issue in cloud computing. The nature of the scheduling issue is as an NP-Hard problem and because of the success of heuristic algorithms in optimization and NP-Hard problems, the authors use a newly inspired bat algorithm and chaos theory to scheduling the tasks in the cloud. In this method, bat or candidate solutions are represented by a one-dimensional array. The fitness function is calculated based on makespan and energy consumption. The results show that the proposed method can schedule the received tasks in proper time than other compared heuristic algorithms, also the proposed method has better performance in term of makespan and energy consumption than compared methods.
