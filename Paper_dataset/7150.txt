AB Recent advances in ICT technologies lead to intelligent services based on monitoring data. A system for the intelligent services is called as a cyber physical system (CPS). The CPS is an IoT-Cloud system which is an integrated system between computing world and a physical sensor field. It makes feasible applications by connecting the monitoring data in the physical world to decision making in the computing world. That is, between the physical world and the computing world, the CPS supports various interactions to objects as IoT-Cloud system. In the physical sensor field of the CPS, a sensor network, which consists of sensors and actuators is constructed. ZigBee is considered as the representative wireless communication technology for the sensor network. However, it has short transmission range and uses shared frequency band with high competition. Therefore, it is not suitable for the CPS applications with long service range such as smart factory or smart environment monitoring. For these CPS applications, it is required to apply low power wide area network (LPWAN) to the sensor network. In this paper, LPWAN requirements for the CPS (i.e., the IoT-Cloud system) applications are analyzed and a radio management method for data transmission of LPWAN in the IoT-Cloud system is designed. For the validation of the efficiency of the data transmission, computer simulations are carried out. Results show that the proposed method outperforms state of the art methods. In this way, the proposal improves the transmission delay over TDMA in between 33 and 51% depending on the number of sensors considered and presents a superior performance in the transmission of data packets.
