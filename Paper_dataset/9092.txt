   Threat probability
AB The BGP-based inter-domain routing system plays an important role in the Internet. However, the BGP has some design flaws, which result in many serious security problems for the inter-domain routing system. Recently there has been a new kind of LDoS attack against BGP sessions from data plane. Compared to traditional control plane threats, such as prefix hijacking, the new attack, BGP-LDoS exploits the vulnerability of adaptive mechanism of BGP and would trigger a wild range of cascading failure in inter domain routing system. Unfortunately, existing methods are difficult to detect this threat. To end this, we propose a method based on adaptive fusion of multi features to perceive security threats of inter domain routing system. Several statistics attributes of BGP routing, information are firstly chosen to be security features. Then we establish a normal state sub-model for each security features and fuse them together to describe the normal state of the system by linear weighting. Since the fusion model represents the system security state very well, we can obtain the threat probability by computing the deviation of security features from their normal values. The experimental results show that the method can perceive not only control plane threats but also data plane threats of inter domain routing system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
