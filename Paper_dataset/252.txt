AB A two-party private set intersection allows two parties, the client and the server, to compute an intersection over their private sets, without revealing any information beyond the intersecting elements. We present a novel private set intersection protocol based on Shuhong Gao's fully homomorphic encryption scheme and prove the security of the protocol in the semi-honest model. We also present a variant of the protocol which is a completely novel construction for computing the intersection based on Bloom filter and fully homomorphic encryption, and the protocol's complexity is independent of the set size of the client. The security of the protocols relies on the learning with errors and ring learning with error problems. Furthermore, in the cloud with malicious adversaries, the computation of the private set intersection can be outsourced to the cloud service provider without revealing any private information.
