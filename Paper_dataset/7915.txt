AB With the growing popularity of cloud computing, different infrastructure as a service cloud frameworks do exists. Each framework has significant impact on robustness, scalability, fault-tolerance, energy efficiency, and so on of the cloud. To bring good characteristics of open source clouds and commercial clouds under a roof, a six layered green cloud framework namely SERVmegh is proposed. Resource management, green power management, workload analyzer and manager, and on/off control components of SERVmegh framework are designed and developed. Energy-efficient resource wastage reduction methodology for resource management is proposed. Algorithms for resource management, virtual machine placement, and minimization of virtual machine migrations using resource wastage reduction methodology are implemented. The performance of proposed algorithms is evaluated in CloudSim simulation and OpenNubula open source cloud environment. The results depict significant energy savings under different scenarios.
