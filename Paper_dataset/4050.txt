AB Cloud computing (CC) is an advanced technology that provides data sharing and access to computing resources. The cloud deployment model represents the exact type of cloud environment based on ownership, size, and accessibility rights, and also describes the purpose and nature of the cloud. Since all processes today are computerized, consumers need a lot amount of data and cache size. The security of the cloud is ensured in many levels, but the scope of intrusions makes it necessary to understand the factors that affect cloud security. CC-certified users rely on third parties for their other important security issues in third-party computing clouds. A DDoS attack is an attack-type in which it is not necessary to send a large number of packets to the server, which makes it impossible for legitimate users to access them. In this research work, a DDoS attack was launched and a tool for launching a DDoS attack was discussed. In this research, DDoS attacks were rejected using three different SNORT rules. In this research, rules predefined for detecting DDoS attacks on SNORT profiles detect and prevent DDoS attacks, but because they block certain legitimate requests and generate false alarms, this should be the subject of future research.
