AB The monitoring systems on the climatic conditions in the agriculture industry are increasingly useful and applicable since they allow to improve the processes of growth in the plants. This paper develops a monitoring system for the germination of Ocimum basilicum seeds using image processing and fuzzy logic techniques. Besides, the system is based on the Cloudino-IoT and FIWARE platforms as a real-time monitoring alternative. Therefore, temperature and humidity parameters can be observed in real-time. On the one hand, the system controls the variables through fuzzy control techniques and image processing monitors the germination in the radicle seed, and on the other, context data is used by the Cloudino-IoT and FIWARE platforms. On the other hand, the use of these combined open-source platforms allows cloud computing to be enabled to maintain, specify, analyze the data and automate the environmental parameters that allow maintaining temperature and humidity levels at optimal levels to create a favorable germination environment. The performance of the set-point control is compared with experimental results and the function interconnection of the IoT devices.
