AB Inadequate and inappropriate intake of food is known to cause various health issues and diseases. Due to lack of concise information about healthy diet, people have to rely on medicines instead of taking preventive measures in food intake. Due to diversity in food components and large number of dietary sources, it is challenging to perform real-time selection of diet patterns that must fulfill one's nutrition needs. Particularly, selection of proper diet is critical for patients suffering from various diseases. In this article, we highlight the issue of selection of proper diet that must fulfill patients' nutrition requirements. To address this issue, we present a cloud based food recommendation system, called Diet-Right, for dietary recommendations based on users' pathological reports. The model uses ant colony algorithm to generate optimal food list and recommends suitable foods according to the values of pathological reports. Diet-Right can play a vital role in controlling various diseases. The experimental results show that compared to single node execution, the convergence time of parallel execution on cloud is approximately 12 times lower. Moreover, adequate accuracy is attainable by increasing the number of ants.
