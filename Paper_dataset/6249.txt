AB Enterprise and Service Provider networks are increasingly making use of Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) to reap the benefits of reduced Capital expenditures (CAPEX) and Operating expenses (OPEX). Total cost of ownership calculations however are typically a function of the attainable network performance, which in a virtualized system is highly dependent on the overall system architecture and the resource allocation policy. This paper examines how to improve the overall performance of deploying VNFs in a virtualized environment, proposing an appropriate architectural framework to leverage the capabilities of other technologies such as Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Cloud Computing which can be highly complemented with the Network Function Virtualization (NFV) paradigm. We focus on the standardization of the three technologies under a common architecture and we incorporate resource allocation as a main functional architectural block. The problem studied is referred as the VNF placement problem, and tries to efficiently, intelligently, and dynamically allocate a series of VNFs comprising a service chain in a cloud environment according to the current status of the cloud resources. We propose and evaluate a set of algorithms towards satisfying the requirement of enterprise and service providers to grant high performance VNFs for the end users, while allowing the cloud providers to profitably utilize the available resources.
