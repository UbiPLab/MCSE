AB Global illumination of natural scenes in real time like forests is one of the most complex problems to solve, because the multiple inter-reflections between the light and material of the objects composing the scene. The major problem that arises is the problem of visibility computation. In fact, the computing of visibility is carried out for all the set of leaves visible from the center of a given leaf, given the enormous number of leaves present in a tree, this computation performed for each leaf of the tree which also reduces performance. We describe a new approach that approximates visibility queries, which precede in two steps. The first step is to generate point cloud representing the foliage. We assume that the point cloud is composed of two classes (visible, not-visible) non-linearly separable. The second step is to perform a point cloud classification by applying the Gaussian radial basis function, which measures the similarity in term of distance between each leaf and a landmark leaf. It allows approximating the visibility requests to extract the leaves that will be used to calculate the amount of indirect illumination exchanged between neighbor leaves. Our approach allows efficiently treat the light exchanges in the scene of a forest, it allows a fast computation and produces images of good visual quality, all this takes advantage of the immense power of computation of the GPU.
