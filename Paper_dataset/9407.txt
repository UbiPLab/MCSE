AB Unquestionably, the proliferation of mobile devices has dominated the main streams in contemporary ubiquitous wireless networks. Unfortunately, the misappropriating of those state-of-the-art gadgets has resulted in unprecedented information security issues in next generation cyberspace security arena. This paper illustrates the essence of generic procedures to provide the probative digital evidences for a typical Gmail Chat session in connection with the IE browser under different scenarios. When the computer-related information security issues arise with regard to the company, the corporate information incident response team should be able to disclose and preserve the evaporating digital trails following the right procedures to avoid the volatile characteristics in their natures. Furthermore, the design of the experiments of the paper identifies four cases to demonstrate the feasibility, availability, reliability, and traceability among them, which are essential for the corporate information security staffs to seriously consider when mushrooming cyber crimes are unknowingly and hastily burgeoning in an unparalleled manner. The organizations might have to scrutinize the negligible digital trails with cognitive expertise instead of entirely relying on law enforcement agencies from the public sectors due to the time constraints as well as publicity concerns or the minor computing resource policy violation unwarily occurred by the employees accordingly.
