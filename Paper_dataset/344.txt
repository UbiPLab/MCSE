AB Edge computing extends the service resources of cloud computing to the edge of the network, providing less latency and higher bandwidth utilization. The relay edge computing wireless network (RECWN) with intelligent edge device can effectively solve the problem of wireless signal transmission distance and attenuation. However, the relay node's forwarding brings greater risks to the leakage of private information. In this article, we propose a homomorphic encryption and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based channel coding scheme to address the problem of stealing private information from users by incompletely trusted relay node or potential malicious nodes. Specifically, the homomorphic encryption algorithm is adopted to protect the privacy of users' private information. Furthermore, the code domain NOMA and LDPC algorithm are introduced to compensate for the problem of drastic drop in communication performance caused by poor sub-channel conditions, thereby improving the efficiency of data transmission, and guaranteeing the users' QoS requirements and fairness. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed channel coding scheme has better performance than the existing approaches in terms of privacy preservation and data transmission efficiency.
