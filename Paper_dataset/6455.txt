AB The oil wells are of similar physical parameters but different production parameters in an oilfield block, but selecting the equipment for every well one by one is unpractical. The measured polished rod load data was taken into account in the Fuzzy Clustering C Means algorithm to work out the typical production data, such as polished rod load on the basis of the cloud computing processing for the vast measured polished rod load data in the test wells in a block. The dynamical equation of the chain pumping unit being constructed, the load data are used to simulate the motion of the pumping unit by means of the numerical iteration algorithm. It is shown that the max acceleration does not occur at the up and down dead points in the stroke but at the position about 5-11 (ay) from the dead points. The combination of the typical production data resulting from the cloud computing processing and the numerical iteration algorithm can solve the practical problem of equipment selection and simulation.
