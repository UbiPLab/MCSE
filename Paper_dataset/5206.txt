AB Energy consumption has been identified as one of the key research challenges during recent time in Cloud computing. Proper placement of Virtual Machines (VMs) on servers may address the issue. The process of placing VMs on servers can be divided into two phases viz. (a) Mapping of VMs on servers during the phase and (b) subsequent VM selection, migration and placement during consolidation phase. If the initial mapping is not efficient, subsequent operations may lead to unnecessary VM migrations, which in turn, may result into increase in migration cost and increase in SLA violations. In this research, the authors aim to improve the resource utilization to address these issues by keeping (i) the number of live server as minimal as possible for achieving energy efficiency, and (ii) the live server, as busy as possible by efficiently utilizing them. The authors conducted series of experiments with existing default technique and various other approaches. The results of our experiments make us conclude that there is a scope of improvement in the default mapping technique currently being used in CloudSim.
