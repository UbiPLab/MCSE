AB The routing process in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) is a challenging task in urban areas which is due to the high mobility of vehicles, repetitive defects of the communication path, and the various barriers that may affect the reliability of data transmission and routing. Accordingly, the connectivity in vehicular communications has received the researchers' attention, so different geographic routing protocols have been proposed in this respect. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are useful for overcoming routing constraints. Cloud computing has also been defined as a new infrastructure for VANET which is made up of a significant number of computing nodes including stable data centers as well as a set of mobile computing devices embedded on vehicles. The aim of this research is to simulate a VANET in an urban area using cloud computing infrastructure and applying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) so that the negative influence of barriers in packet delivery and routing is avoided. To evaluate, the proposed method is compared with the basic protocol ClouDiV. Ns-2 simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms with different densities and variable times in terms of efficiency and performance.
