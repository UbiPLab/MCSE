AB With the help of cloud computing, users can outsource their data to a cloud service provider (CSP) and enjoy the high-quality on-demand services from the cloud. On the other hand, once owners no longer have physical possession of the outsourced data, the protection of data integrity in cloud computing becomes a critical and challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel and verifiable auditing scheme for outsourced database without a third party auditor (TPA). It can simultaneously authenticate the correctness and completeness of query results, preventing the dishonest CSP from returning fake or incomplete results to the users. Our scheme also supports partial attribute retrieval and flexible data dynamics. The security proof and the performance analysis show that our proposed scheme is secure and efficient for practical deployment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
