AB Testbeds are common in engineering education. Testbeds provides a platform for learning and simulation of complex engineering tasks. C4I (Command, Control, Communication, Computer and Intelligence) systems are critical systems of systems. These systems are used in different domains like battlefield management, emergency response, and in disaster/recovery management etc. Due to the sensitive nature of these domains and applications of these systems, testing them in real environment is difficult. Usually, testbeds are used to test and simulate such systems. Testbeds also help to better learn and understand the systems. C4I systems can be expanded or upgraded to enhance their functionality by adding more computing resources. Cloud computing provides a solution for the convenient access and scaling of resources. Recently, researchers envisioned to deploy command and control systems using cloud. However, there are many issues in such deployment, security is one of them. In this research paper security requirements and concerns of cloud based C4I systems are highlighted. Cloud computing and C4I systems are discussed from the security point of view. Furthermore, an enhanced encryption algorithm to improve data confidentiality is presented in this paper and its security is analyzed. This research will be helpful for both academia and industry to further strengthen the basis of cloud based C4I systems by improving data confidentiality.
