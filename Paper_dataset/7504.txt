AB This paper proposes the ORB-SHOT SLAM or OS-SLAM, which is a novel method of 3D loop closing for trajectory correction of RGB-D visual SLAM. We obtain point clouds from RGB-D sensors such as Kinect or Xtion, and we use 3D SHOT descriptors to describe the ORB corners. Then, we train an offline 3D vocabulary that contains more than 600,000 words by using two million 3D descriptors based on a large number of images from a public dataset provided by TUM. We convert new images to bag-of-visual-words (BoVW) vectors and push these vectors into an incremental database. We query the database for new images to detect the corresponding 3D loop candidates, and compute similarity scores between the new image and each corresponding 3D loop candidate. After detecting 2D loop closures using ORB-SLAM2 system, we accept those loop closures that are also included in the 3D loop candidates, and we assign them corresponding weights according to the scores stored previously. In the final graph-based optimization, we create edges with different weights for loop closures and correct the trajectory by solving a nonlinear least-squares optimization problem. We compare our results with several state-of-the-art systems such as ORB-SLAM2 and RGB-D SLAM by using the TUM public RGB-D dataset. We find that accurate loop closures and suitable weights reduce the error on trajectory estimation more effectively than other systems. The performance of ORB-SHOT SLAM is demonstrated by 3D reconstruction application.
