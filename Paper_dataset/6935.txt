AB Cloud computing provides a service based environment for data storage and resource sharing that are available to user through internet with on-demand basis. Thus, users can access their data across any geographical location at any time. Cloud environment also provides better scalability, flexibility, high performance, availability and less storage cost as compared to other physical storage of data. Maintaining data integrity and security in cloud environment is difficult especially, when the stored data is not completely reliable and trustworthy. However, the security of stored data is the major concerned for organizations and individual user to adopt cloud based environment. In this paper, we have proposed and enhanced the functionalities of third party auditor server to protect the availability and integrity of outsourced data in a cloud environment. The proposed approach uses the functionality such as, public verifiability, metadata generation, data dynamics, storage access point, encryption and decryption of data through RSA algorithm and IP range in case of private cloud. The proposed work also focuses on a solution to reliability, availability and integrity of data that are the major issues in the cloud adoption.
