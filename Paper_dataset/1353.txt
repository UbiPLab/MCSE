AB To ensure the integrity of cloud storage, it is necessary for data owners to launch data integrity auditing (DIA) periodically. To fit more application scenarios, the research direction is shifted to design identity-based DIA (ID-DIA) protocols without expensive public key infrastructure, which can resist the quantum computing attacks simultaneously. However, the existing ID-DIA protocols are usually based on heavy anti-quantum computing cryptographies, which might severely limit their practical deployments. To address this problem, we explore three ways to design RLWE-based ID-DIA (ID-DIA-RLWE) protocols. The first is to improve the existing LWE-based ID-DIA protocols. The second is to enhance the existing RLWE-based DIA protocols. The third is to instantiate the proposed semantic ID-DIA protocol. Among these three proposed protocols, the third one is the most efficient due to its simplest construction. We also propose a new security model of ID-DIA protocols, including correctness assurance, security guarantee, and privacy protection. Then, we provide theoretical analysis of all proposed ID-DIA protocols under the given security model. Finally, we conduct extensive performance evaluation and comparison, which further validate that the third protocol has superiority in the perspectives of computation, communication, and storage costs.
