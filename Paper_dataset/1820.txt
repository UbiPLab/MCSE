DE attribute-based encryption; cloud computing; data sharing
AB With the rapid development of cloud computing, it is playing an increasingly important role in data sharing. Meanwhile, attribute-based encryption (ABE) has been an effective way to share data securely in cloud computing. In real circumstances, there is often a mutual access sub-policy in different providers' access policies, and the significance of each attribute is usual diverse. In this paper, a secure and efficient data-sharing scheme in cloud computing, which is called unified ciphertext-policy weighted attribute-based encryption (UCP-WABE), is proposed. The weighted attribute authority assigns weights to attributes depending on their importance. The mutual information extractor extracts the mutual access sub-policy and generates the mutual information. Thus, UCP-WABE lowers the total encryption time cost of multiple providers. We prove that UCP-WABE is selectively secure on the basis of the security of ciphertext-policy weighted attribute-based encryption (CP-WABE). Additionally, the results of the implementation shows that UCP-WABE is efficient in terms of time.
