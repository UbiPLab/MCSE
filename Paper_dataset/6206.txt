AB The Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud (CGC; www.cancergenomicscloud.org) enables researchers to rapidly access and collaborate on massive public cancer genomic datasets, including The Cancer Genome Atlas. It provides secure on-demand access to data, analysis tools, and computing resources. Researchers from diverse backgrounds can easily visualize, query, and explore cancer genomic datasets visually or programmatically. Data of interest can be immediately analyzed in the cloud using more than 200 preinstalled, curated bioinformatics tools and workflows. Researchers can also extend the functionality of the platform by adding their own data and tools via an intuitive software development kit. By colocalizing these resources in the cloud, the CGC enables scalable, reproducible analyses. Researchers worldwide can use the CGC to investigate key questions in cancer genomics. (C) 2017 AACR.
