AB Edge computing (EC) is a promising technology capable of bridging the gap between Cloud computing services and the demands of emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Most EC-based solutions, from wearable devices to smart cities architectures, benefit from Machine Learning (ML) methods to perform various tasks, such as classification. In these cases, ML solutions need to deal efficiently with a huge amount of data, while balancing predictive performance, memory and time costs, and energy consumption. The fact that these data usually come in the form of a continuous and evolving data stream makes the scenario even more challenging. Many algorithms have been proposed to cope with data stream classification, e.g., Very Fast Decision Tree (VFDT) and Strict VFDT (SVFDT). Recently, Online Local Boosting (OLBoost) has also been introduced to improve predictive performance without modifying the underlying structure of the decision tree produced by these algorithms. In this work, we compared the four-way relationship among time efficiency, energy consumption, predictive performance, and memory costs, tuning the hyperparameters of VFDT and the two versions of SVFDT with and without OLBoost. Experiments over 6 benchmark datasets using an EC device revealed that VFDT and SVFDT-I were the most energy-friendly algorithms, with SVFDT-I also significantly reducing memory consumption. OLBoost, as expected, improved the predictive performance, but caused a deterioration in memory and energy consumption.
