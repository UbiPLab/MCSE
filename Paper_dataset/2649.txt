AB Collecting data is an important task for building smart cities. This article proposes SensingBus, a system to collect data from sensors carried by urban buses. Using buses to move sensors allows each node to cover a wider area, at a negligible cost. SensingBus is based on a three-level architecture. At the first level, sensing nodes collect and send data to the second level, consisting of fog nodes. The fog nodes preprocess data and deliver it to the third level, the cloud infrastructure, which stores and makes data externally available. The fog infrastructure, on the other hand, discards defective data, compresses information, and provides secure access points between the fog and the cloud. To validate SensingBus, the authors built a prototype and performed experiments to stress the fog nodes. They verified that each fog node can serve at least 20 simultaneous sensing nodes, an adequate number to sense a city such as Rio de Janeiro.
