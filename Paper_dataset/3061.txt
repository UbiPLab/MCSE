AB Cloud computing is the fastest growing field of service provision in Information Technology (IT) industry. It provides on-demand and cost-effective services such as Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). In cloud environment, many security challenges have pinched out such as data security, malicious insider attack, cyber attack, and abuse of cloud services. In this paper, we have analyzed and identified the different major gaps between conventional access control schemes based on their demerits and requirements for the cloud access. We have proposed a Light-Weight Access Control (LWAC) model, which fulfills all cloud access control requirements. Our approach has ensured the secure and efficient sharing of resources among various non-trusted tenants and also has the capacity to support the different access permissions for the same user using multiple services securely. We have also implemented a prototype of our work which illustrates the efficient access control in the cloud environment. This prototype delivers the different cloud services within the distributed cloud environment. It also demonstrates the effective and secure access control to fetch multiple services for various resources within the capabilities assigned to the user. The comparative results show the genuine application of our approach within the latest distributed cloud environment.
