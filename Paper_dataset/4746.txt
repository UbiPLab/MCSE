AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technology paradigm that provides a global network of services through a wide variety of smart devices. In order to provide a high flexible and reliable platform of IoT, an IoT platform that integrated fog and cloud computing (IFCIoT) is considered in this paper. In the IFCIoT platform, fault tolerance is an important issue. In order to deal with the impact of a failed component before performing certain special tasks, it is worth paying attention to reach a common agreement in the event of a failure. However, most previous protocols for the agreement problem of distributed computing are not suitable for the IFCIoT platform. The protocol proposed by this paper can achieve agreement among all fault-free nodes with the minimal rounds of message exchanges and tolerate the maximum number of dormant and malicious faulty components in the IFCIoT platform. The theoretical proof of the complexity and the correctness is illustrated.
