AB The ease and affordability offered by the cloud computing has attracted large number of customers towards it. Cloud service providers offer its services, to the cloud customers, usually in form of Virtual Machines (VMs). With the growth in the number of customers, cloud data centers encounter overwhelming number of VM requests. These requests need to be mapped on the real cloud hardware and therefore, VM placement has been an important research area in the cloud research community. Virtual machine placement, being an NP hard problem, is modelled as an optimization problem with the objective to optimize resource wastage. Dragonfly Algorithm (DA), a nature inspired technique, originates from static and dynamic swarming behavior of dragonfly and is well suited to solve VM placement problem. Therefore, in the proposed work, a modified dragonfly algorithm is applied for VM placement for better resource utilization at cloud data centers. The performance of the proposed model is analyzed through simulation and comparative study. Observations, obtained from the experiments, exhibit the superiority of the proposed model in solving VM placement problem.
