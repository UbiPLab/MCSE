AB Fog computing is a new paradigm of distributed computing that extends the cloud's capability to the edge of the network. It can provide better quality of service, and is particularly suitable for IoT applications, which generally have stringent requirements on latency arid reliability. In this article, we consider the flight security and safety of UAVs, which act as fog nodes in an airborne fog computing system. In particular, we propose a method to detect UPS spoofing based on the monocular camera arid IMU sensor of a UAV. We also present an image localization approach to support UAV autonomous return using error reduction based on ORB feature detection and matching. The methods are demonstrated by experiments using a DJI Phantom 4 drone.
