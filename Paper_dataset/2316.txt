AB Accurate prediction of server load is important to cloud systems for improving the resource utilization, reducing the energy consumption and guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS). This paper analyzes the features of cloud server load and the advantages and disadvantages of typical server load prediction algorithms, integrates the cloud model (CM) and the Markov chain (MC) together to realize a new CM-MC algorithm, and then proposes a new server load prediction algorithm based on CM-MC for cloud systems. The algorithm utilizes the historical data sample training method of the cloud model, and utilizes the Markov prediction theory to obtain the membership degree vector, based on which the weighted sum of the predicted values is used for the cloud model. The experiments show that the proposed prediction algorithm has higher prediction accuracy than other typical server load prediction algorithms, especially if the data has significant volatility. The proposed server load prediction algorithm based on CM-MC is suitable for cloud systems, and can help to reduce the energy consumption of cloud data centers.
