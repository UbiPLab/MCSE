AB With the emergence of the Future Internet and the dawning of new IT models such as cloud computing, the usage of data centers (DC), and consequently their power consumption, increase dramatically. Besides the ecological impact, the energy consumption is a predominant criterion for DC providers since it determines the daily cost of their infrastructure. As a consequence, power management becomes one of the main challenges for DC infrastructures and more generally for large-scale-distributed systems. In this paper, we present the EpoCloud prototype, from hardware to middleware layers. This prototype aims at optimizing the energy consumption of mono-site Cloud DCs connected to the regular electrical grid and to renewable-energy sources.
