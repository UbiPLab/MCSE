AB Absorbed shortwave radiation at the surface is an important component of energy analysis among the atmosphere, land, and ocean. In this study, the absorbed shortwave radiation was calculated using a radiation model and surface broadband albedo data for application to Geostationary Earth Orbit Korea Multi-Purpose SATellite (GEO-KOMPSAT-2A; GK-2A). And the results (GWNU algorithm) were compared with CERES data and calculation results using pyranometer and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data to be selected as the reference absorbed shortwave radiation. This GWNU algorithm was also compared with the physical and statistical algorithms of GOSE-R ABI and two algorithms (Li et al., 1993; Kim and Jeong, 2016) using regression equation. As a result, the absorbed shortwave radiation calculated by GWNU algorithm was more accurate than the values calculated by the other algorithms. However, if the problem about computing time and accuracy of albedo data arise when absorbed shortwave radiation is calculated by GWNU algorithm, then the empirical algorithms explained above should be used with GWNU algorithm.
