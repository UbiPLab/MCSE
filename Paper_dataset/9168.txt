AB Advancements in the areas of Cloud Computing, Internet of Things (IoT), and hybrid Human-Computer systems have made feasible the creation of a highly integrated human-machine world. The concept of elasticity plays a crucial role in fulfilling this vision, enabling systems to address various requirements reflecting performance, security, and business concerns. However, elastic systems are still in their inception, and numerous challenges need to be addressed in their development and management.
   In this article we present an overview of our experience on elastic systems, with a focus on elastic cloud systems. In the quest for designing and managing elastic systems, several challenges need to be addressed, such as: (i) enabling the systems to fulfill different requirements from multiple involved stakeholders, (ii) designing elastic systems considering various degrees of elasticity capabilities provided by different technologies and environments, (iii) understanding behavioral relationships in elastic systems, and their effects on stakeholder requirements, (iv) monitoring costs and analyzing cost efficiency of elastic systems, (v) controlling the elasticity of such systems at runtime in order to fulfill stakeholders' requirements, and (vi) supporting system elasticity through operations management. We present the techniques we have adopted in order to tackle the above challenges. We introduce our solution for creating elastic systems, following their complete lifecycle, from design-time to operations management.
