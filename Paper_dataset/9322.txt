AB The dramatically growing demand of Cyber Physical and Social Computing (CPSC) has enabled a variety of novel channels to reach services in the financial industry. Combining cloud systems with multimedia big data is a novel approach for Financial Service Institutions (FSIs) to diversify service offerings in an efficient manner. However, the security issue is still a great issue in which the service availability often conflicts with the security constraints when the service media channels are varied. This paper focuses on this problem and proposes a novel approach using the Semantic-Based Access Control (SBAC) techniques for acquiring secure financial services on multimedia big data in cloud computing. The proposed approach is entitled IntercroSsed Secure Big Multimedia Model (2SBM), which is designed to secure accesses between various media through the multiple cloud platforms. The main algorithms supporting the proposed model include the Ontology-Based Access Recognition (OBAR) Algorithm and the Semantic Information Matching (SIM) Algorithm. We implement an experimental evaluation to prove the correctness and adoptability of our proposed scheme.
