AB Cloud computing offers a wide range of on-demand resources over the internet. Utility-based resource allocation in cloud data centers significantly increases the number of cloud users. Heavy usage of cloud data center encounters many problems such as sacrificing system performance, increasing operational cost and high-energy consumption. Therefore, the result of the system damages the environment extremely due to heavy carbon (CO2) emission. However, dynamic allocation of energy-efficient resources in cloud data centers overcomes these problems. In this paper, we have proposed Energy and Service Level Agreement (SLA) Aware Resource Allocation Heuristic Algorithms. These algorithms are essential for reducing power consumption and SLA violation without diminishing the performance and Quality-of-Service (QoS) in cloud data centers. Our proposed model is organized as follows: a) SLA violation detection model is used to prevent Virtual Machines (VMs) from overloaded and underloaded host usage; b) for reducing power consumption of VMs, we have introduced Enhanced minPower and maxUtilization (EMPMU) VM migration policy; and c) efficient utilization of cloud resources and VM placement are achieved using SLA-aware Modified Best Fit Decreasing (MBFD) algorithm. We have validated our test results using CloudSim toolkit 3.0.3. Finally, experimental results have shown better resource utilization, reduced energy consumption and SLA violation in heterogeneous dynamic cloud environment.
