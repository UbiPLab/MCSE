AB Cloud computing is a new way of data storage, where users tend to upload video data to cloud servers without redundantly local copies. However, it keeps the data out of users' hands which would conventionally control and manage the data. Therefore, it becomes the key issue on how to ensure the integrity and reliability of the video data stored in the cloud for the provision of video streaming services to end users. This paper details the verificationmethods for the integrity of video data encrypted using the fully homomorphic crytosystems in the context of cloud computing. Specifically, we apply dynamic operation to video data stored in the cloud with the method of block tags, so that the integrity of the data can be successfully verified. The whole process is based on the analysis of present Remote Data Integrity Checking (RDIC) methods.
