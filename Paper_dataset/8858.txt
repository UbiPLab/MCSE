AB The traditional collaborative plotting system only allows one online user to plot the information and the data between users cannot be shared. Therefore, in modern society, it is unable to meet the needs for multiuse's' plotting online at the same time. Spatial knowledge system of heterogeneous spatial information based on cloud computing technology presented in this paper realized high concurrency and high online number of the collaborative plotting. It can dynamically collect global information and enhance the communication and collaboration between users. The system increases the spatial information services to high levels of global spatial knowledge cloud services. Experiments show that this system can realize the multiuse's online plotting; meanwhile it has fast response time and good stability.
