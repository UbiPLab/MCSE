AB With the increasing popularity of cloud computing, query outsourcing services are becoming widely available for many business applications. However, the third-party cloud server which provides query service is untrusted, and thus the correctness of query results needs to be authenticated by the users. Suppose there is a database where each record has multiple attributes, users submit multi-dimensional top-k queries to retrieve k records whose outputs with user-supplied scoring function are among the top k. Multi-dimensional top-k query is widely used in real applications, such as information retrieval, decision making, and disease prediction. Unfortunately, the traditional query authentication methods cannot be directly deployed on multidimensional top-k query, thus it is still a challenging problem to authenticate multi-dimensional top-k query results. We first propose an authentication solution to support multi-dimensional top-k query based on signature chain. By using signature chain for each record and its successors on each dimension, our solution allows users to efficiently verify the soundness and completeness of the multi-dimensional top-k query results. In addition, we propose an extended solution using larger grid size in order to decrease the overhead in the data owner side in sparse data distribution. The security analysis shows that our multi-dimensional top-k query authentication solutions are secure. Through theoretical analysis and simulation, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed solution.
