AB Load balanced transaction scheduling problem is an important issue in distributed computing environments including grid system. This problem is known to be NP-hard and can be solved by using heuristic as well as any meta-heuristic method. We ponder over the problem of the load balanced transaction scheduling in a grid processing system by using an Ant Colony Optimization for load balancing. The problem that we consider is to achieve good execution characteristics for a given set of transactions that has to be completed within their given deadline. We propose a transaction processing algorithm based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for load balanced transaction scheduling. We modify two meta-heuristic along with ACO and three heuristic scheduling algorithms for the purpose of comparison with our proposed algorithm. The results of the comparison show that the proposed algorithm provides better results for the load balanced transaction scheduling in the grid processing system. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.
