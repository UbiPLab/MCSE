AB The histogram in each patch of the input image is a useful feature applied for various development of image processing techniques. However, if the size of the input image is very large, the histogram construction of each patch in the image becomes very time-consuming. For applications involving the processing of several very large images, this paper proposes a superior patchwise histogram construction algorithm based on cloud-computing architecture that is faster than similar state-of-the-art approaches. Through the modern communication network, the computation cost can be easily shared to construct several patchwise histograms at the same time. The proposed algorithm is the fastest solution in the field as well as applicable to various data processing procedures related to probability distribution. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has the best performance compared to other related algorithms.
