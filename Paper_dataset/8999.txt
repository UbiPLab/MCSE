AB Fog computing is a new paradigm providing network services such as computing, storage between the end users and cloud. The distributed and open structure are the characteristics of fog computing, which make it vulnerable and very weak to security threats. In this article, the interaction between vulnerable nodes and malicious nodes in the fog computing is investigated as a non-cooperative differential game. The complex decision making process is reviewed and analyzed. To solve the game, a fictitious play-based algorithm is which the vulnerable node and the malicious nodes reach a feedback Nash equilibrium. We attain optimal strategy of energy consumption with QoS guarantee for the system, which are conveniently operated and suitable for fog nodes. The system simulation identifies the propagation of malicious nodes. We also determine the effects of various parameters on the optimal strategy. The simulation results support a theoretical foundation to limit malicious nodes in fog computing, which can help fog service providers make the optimal dynamic strategies when different types of nodes dynamically change their strategies.
