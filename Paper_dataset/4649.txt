AB Brain health quality pre-monitoring has become an urgent need, and this is a system of complex engineering. From the perspective of intelligent decision-making based on big data, the intelligent air index prediction is introduced, the popular classification algorithm is introduced, the hidden information of historical data is mined, and the brain health quality prediction is realized. The brain health quality monitoring system based on the Internet of Things is constructed, and the classification algorithm is used to realize real-time acquisition, intelligent processing of data. In order to improve the data processing speed and enhance the real-time performance of brain health quality prediction, this paper introduces cloud computing technology to accelerate data processing. In order to enable users to understand the air index, anytime and anywhere, it is also designed based on the problem of large historical data of air index and real-time data collection. The Android platform develops an air index forecast client.
