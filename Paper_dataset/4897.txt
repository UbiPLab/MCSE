AB Cloud computing provides a new, attractive paradigm for the effective sharing of storage and computing resources among global consumers. More and more enterprises have begun to enter the field of cloud computing and storing data in the cloud to facilitate the sharing data among users. However, in many cases, users may be concerned about data privacy, trust, and integrity. It is challenging to provide data sharing services without sacrificing these security requirements. In this paper, a data sharing scheme of reliable, secure, and privacy protection based on general access structure is introduced. The proposed scheme is not only effective and flexible, but also is capable of protecting privacy for the cloud owner, supporting data sharing under supervision, enabling accountability of users' decryption keys, and identifying cheaters if some users behave dishonestly. Security analysis and efficiency analysis demonstrate that our proposed scheme has better performance in computational costs compared with most related works. The scheme is versatile to be used in various environments. For example, it is particularly suitable to be employed to protect personal health data and medical diagnostic data in information medical environment.
