AB The dust aerosols have an important effect on the solar radiation in the Martial atmosphere and both surface and atmospheric heating rates, which are also basic drivers of atmospheric dynamics. Aerosols cause an attenuation of the solar radiation traversing the atmosphere and this attenuation is modeled by the Lambert-Beer-Bouguer law, where the aerosol optical thickness plays an important role. Through Angstrom law, the aerosol optical thickness can be approximated and this law allows to model attenuation of the solar radiation traversing the atmosphere by a fractional diffusion equation. The analytical solution is available in the case of one space dimension. When we extend the fractional diffusion equation to the case of two or more space variables, we need large and massive computations to approach numerically the solutions. In this case a suitable strategy is to use the cloud computing to carry out the simulations. We present an introduction to cloud computing applied to the fractional diffusion equation in one dimension.
