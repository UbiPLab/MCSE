AB Cloud computing or remote computing is one of the patterns in the IT field that offers resources in heterogeneous manner. All the resources are put on cloud and we may get access it from any location as pay per use. In dynamic cloud computing environment, efficient job scheduling with allocation of resources on demand is one of the major challenges. It is also a challenge to provide the different resources in the form of web services to the cloud users. In this work we have used an Ant colony optimization approach advantages for solving NP hard problems like Travelling salesman problem. The paper aims to reduce the job execution and completion time based on pheromone value. The results depicted that an Ant colony optimization is a good approach for scheduling of jobs in a cloud computing environment.
