AB The progress in the development in the field of information technology has brought the Internet of Things (IoT) into existence to play a crucial role in our daily lives. There are interconnected sensors or devices that can both collect and also exchange various data among themselves by employing a modern network of communication as an infrastructure that has been connected by many millions of the IoT nodes. After this, there are various applications of the IoT that may be able to provide accurate and fine-grained services to the users. Using this as a strategy which can mitigate an escalation to the congestion of resources, Edge Computing is emerging as the new paradigm that solves the needs of localized computing and the IoT. The Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been emerging to handle the volume of data produced and this can reach a latency of demand of the IoT applications that are intensive in terms of computation. Even though the MEC has advanced in terms of latency of service and has been solidly investigated, the efficiency of data usage and security are not identified clearly. Replication of data is well suited for improving the time taken for a response, global traffic and data sharing as even at the time of server disconnection this can be done. In this work, efficient techniques of data replication for the Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET) like the simple and the random applications are evaluated for improving availability of data which considers all the issues that are related to the MANET like consumption of power, availability of resource, time taken for response and consistency management. The results of the experiment have shown that a random algorithm for replication can achieve a bandwidth that is better in terms of savings compared to a simple replication algorithm.
