AB Datacenter resource utilization and energy consumption are important factors in cloud computing. Virtualization makes effective use of datacenter's resources by using Virtual Machines (VMs). However, most of the available methods for migrating VMs are oblivious to energy consumption. In this paper, we present Energy Efficient Virtual Machine Migration (EVM) technique in order to address pivotal factors that affect the datacenter's servers while migrating VMs. Our proposed EVM technique is based on Energy Based Server Selection (ESS) to select victim and target servers. Our comparative results show that EVM ameliorates the overhead in terms of lower number of server state changes, VM migration and oscillations, and outperforms existing methods, such as Arbitrary Server Selection (ASS) and First Fit Strategy (FFS). The experimental results show that EVM achieved 31% more energy saving than ASS and 15% more than FSS at 30% server load. The proposed EVM technique should enhance and facilitate energy consumption in VMs migration.
