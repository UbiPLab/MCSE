AB Cloud-native computing with edge clouds is dominating the current computing paradigm. To prepare a flexible testbed for this paradigm, the build-out of K-ONE Playground started in 2015 based on the concept of SmartXPlayground. K-ONE Playground targets a multi-site edge cloud testbed based on the concept of composable playground that can flexibly compose physical, virtual, container resources from a resource pool to user-defined infrastructure. SmartX Playground should properly handle demanding requirements for a composable playground. In this paper, we propose a unique design of reconfigurable clusters, which can provide physical and virtual resources ready for cloud-native DevOps services. We also describe a detailed implementation of the reconfigurable cluster for the real-world infrastructure of K-ONE Playground. Finally, we verify its feasibility with operations and practical examples of cloud-native service development.
