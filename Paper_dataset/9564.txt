AB Recent years have witnessed various successful demonstrations of the emerging IoT technologies, while the researchers still need to face a lot of technological challenges. It is necessary to verify and evaluate the relevant theories and calculations before the application of IoT, and that is why building a simulation platform for the IoT becomes so important, especially for a large scale IoT to meet the requirement of a scale perception in a large scope. The IoT which always contains a complicated network and communication system has made the network simulation software OPNET Modeler to be a good choice for it. Moreover, the IoT has transfer all kinds of "objects" that humans need into the form of data by various sensing equipment and intelligent devices, and those data will be stored, analyzed and processed by cloud computing finally. The paper presents an innovative method to establish an intelligent, independent and expandable data driven IoT service platform by OPNET's Semi-Physical Simulation to combine the simulated network for IoT with the real Cloud computing(SPSIC) which applies real network to achieve the long-term surveillance, management, sharing and analysis of the collected data at any time.
