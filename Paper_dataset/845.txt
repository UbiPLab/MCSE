AB With the continuous development of cloud computing and big data technology, the use of cloud storage is more and more extensive, and a large amount of data is outsourced for public cloud servers, and the security problems that follow are gradually emerging. It can not only protect the data privacy of users, but also realize efficient retrieval and use of data, which is an urgent problem for cloud storage. Based on the existing fuzzy search and encrypted data fuzzy search schemes, this paper uses the characteristics of fuzzy sounds and polysemy that are unique to Chinese, and realizes the synonym construction of keywords through Chinese Pinyin and Chinese-English translation, and establishes the fuzzy word and synonym set of keywords. This paper proposes a Chinese multi-keyword fuzzy search scheme in a cloud environment, which realizes the fuzzy search of multiple Chinese keywords and protects the private key by using a pseudo-random function. Finally, the safety analysis and system experiments verify that the scheme has high security, good practicability, and high search success rate.
