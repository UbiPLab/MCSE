AB The increased use of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) in the cloud and embedded computing environments has led to a number of potential security risks. The sizable amount of logic resources in these devices makes them amenable to sharing across multiple untrusted tenants. However, the co-location of multiple independent circuits presents the possibility of malicious fault injection into an unsuspecting circuit. In this article, the ability of one tenant's FPGA circuit to inject delay faults into another tenant's application located at points across the FPGA die via deliberate supply voltage modulation is investigated. To illustrate the risks involved, a Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) encryption key extraction attack is performed by introducing delay faults in hardware via voltage manipulations. This attack does not require modification to the encryption core nor require attack activation synchronized with specific encryption operations. Our work characterizes the magnitude of on-chip voltage changes and fault injections over time in relation to the on-chip location of the malicious circuit once an attack is initiated. Strategies to identify power manipulation using low-cost monitoring circuits that can locate the source of an attack are highlighted.
