AB A cloud database is a database usually installed on cloud computing software platforms. There are several methods for query processing in cloud databases. This study tried to optimize query processing in the SeaBase cloud database and reduce query processing time. This method used adaptability for optimization. This method was designed for cloud-based databases. The algorithm is composed of three components: 1) multi cloud query separator; 2) query similarity detector based on the execution plan; and 3) replacement policy. This method is implemented as a system for a fully object-oriented simulation. The system is added to the SeaBase as an agent. The evaluation result show that this method reduced response time by 1.9 percent.
