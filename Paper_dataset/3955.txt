AB AES and ECC are considered as the best encryption algorithms, both are approved by NIST and are regarded as next generation algorithm. It is believed that they are quantum computer resistant. The compact ciphertext size of ECC and AES makes them the best choice for cloud computing, sensor networks or small devices where we want resource-saving without compromising the security of the system. But the main issue with AES is key sharing, which is dependent on the secured channel and if that channel gets compromised the communication will also get compromised. To overcome this issue, we are proposing the novel concept, which is generating keys for both AES and ECC using the proposed methodology given in the paper. The algorithm does not need a secured channel at any level as it is inheriting properties of the ECDH algorithm and adding novel concepts with it for key generation. We have observed from the experimental results that our proposed algorithm generates 16-byte key which is inheriting ECC property, so it can with stand with prime factorization attack and QC. The other property is that the key generation algorithm is lesser complex as compared to the existing related algorithms.
