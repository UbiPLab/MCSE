   quality evaluation system
AB Massive open online courses (MOOC) transcends the time and space limits of traditional classroom teaching, and promotes the sharing of teaching resources. However, the effect of this emerging teaching mode is yet to be determined. In this paper, the big data analysis is introduced to evaluate the MOOC teaching quality. Taking several online courses as an example, a video player was designed to compute the learning time using the Hadoop platform. On this basis, the author constructed a teaching quality evaluation platform. In addition, the learning cost coefficient was calculated by the naive Bayesian model, and the evaluation results were analysed in details. The research findings shed practical new light on the evaluation of MOOC teaching quality.
