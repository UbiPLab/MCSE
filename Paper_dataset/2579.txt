AB Traditional cloud-based communications provide powerful cloud computing services. However, simply supporting intensive data processing is not sufficient, especially when capacity is limited and ultra-low latency is required. Thus, it is critical to propose a new Artificial Intelligence (AD-enabled heterogeneous networks, including various terminal networks, fogs and clouds. Derived from cognitive science and data analytics, cognitive computing can mimic or augment human intelligence. When such cognitive intelligence is integrated with communications, traditional services will be renovated with higher accuracy and lower latency. In this paper, we propose cognition-based communications, which originates from both AI-based intelligent computing and advances in communications. Then, we introduce two applications of cognition-based communications, including user-centric cognitive communications, and cognitive intemet of vehicles. Through cognition-based communications, we can better meet users' needs, provide them with a higher Quality of Experience (QoE), and achieve higher energy efficiency.
