AB The authors study cognitive computer vision in a new design space called the Flying IoT. They investigate ultra-low-power computing challenges on a state-of-the-art platform involving a commercial micro UAV. To improve the drone's performance while maintaining low power, they propose a sensor-cloud architecture to process its computer vision algorithms with simple software optimizations that enable the drone to consume less power than cutting-edge embedded processors while achieving better performance.
