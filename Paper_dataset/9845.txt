AB We present an analysis of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) within hydrodynamic simulations of isolated, low-mass (M* similar to 10(9) M-circle dot) disc galaxies. We study the evolution of molecular abundances and the implications for CO emission and the X-CO conversion factor in individual clouds. We define clouds either as regions above a density threshold n(H, min) = 10 cm(-3), or using an observationally motivated CO intensity threshold of 0.25 K km s(-1). Our simulations include a non-equilibrium chemical model with 157 species, including 20 molecules. We also investigate the effects of resolution and pressure floors (i. e. Jeans limiters). We find cloud lifetimes up to approximate to 40 Myr, with a median of 13 Myr, in agreement with observations. At onetenth solar metallicity, young clouds (less than or similar to 10-15 Myr) are underabundant in H-2 andCOcompared to chemical equilibrium, by factors of approximate to 3 and one to two orders of magnitude, respectively. At solar metallicity, GMCs reach chemical equilibrium faster (within approximate to 1Myr). We also compute CO emission from individual clouds. The mean CO intensity, I-CO, is strongly suppressed at low dust extinction, A(v), and possibly saturates towards high A(v), in agreement with observations. The I-CO-A(v) relation shifts towards higher A(v) for higher metallicities and, to a lesser extent, for stronger UV radiation. At one-tenth solar metallicity, CO emission is weaker in young clouds (less than or similar to 10-15 Myr), consistent with the underabundance of CO. Consequently, X-CO decreases by an order of magnitude from 0 to 15 Myr, albeit with a large scatter.
