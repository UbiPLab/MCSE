DE Named data networking; mobile cloud computing; mobile edge computing
AB The technological advances in mobile devices are pushing cloud computing to the network edge, where services such as data storage and processing can be offered by mobile devices locally with improved quality. In this letter, we identify named data networking (NDN) as a key enabler to support "by design" the peculiarities of decentralized edge clouds at the network layer. We extend NDN beyond its original scope of content retrieval facilitator, by letting names to address, not only "contents" but also "cloud services," and enhancing the semantics of NDN primitives to efficiently and reliably support both the provider discovery and the service provisioning phases. An early evaluation is performed to showcase the benefits of the proposal, and also when compared with a traditional TCP/IP-based approach.
