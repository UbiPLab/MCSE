AB As the data arriving from the day to day applications was being increasing from the internet, several problems arise to disseminate the data. The major problem that was being observed recently was to supply the required data to the user who want the exact data from the vast existing data in the internet. The present proposed model was one of the mostly used mechanisms for achieving this task. As the data is huge, the size of the system increases numerously. The cloud computing is the latest technology which was being used to solve such types of problems and provides great opportunities for the users. In this paper, the ESCC Technique which was used to solve such type of problems was discussed in detail. A two layer pub/sub system was developed and analyzed to achieve this task in the environment of cloud computing.
