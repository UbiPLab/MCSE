AB The online telemedicine systems are helpful since they provide timely and effective healthcare services. Such online healthcare systems are usually based on sophisticated and advanced wearable and wireless sensor technologies. A rapid technological growth has improved the scope of many remote health monitoring systems. Here, the researchers employed a cloud-based remote monitoring system for observing the health status of the patients after monitoring their heart rate variability. This system was developed after considering many factors like the ease of application, costs, accuracy, and the data security. Furthermore, this system was also conceptualized to act as an interface between the patients and the healthcare providers, thus ensuring a two-way communication between them. The major aim of this paper was to provide the best healthcare monitoring services to the people living in the remote areas, which was otherwise very difficult owing to the small doctor-to-patient ratio. The researchers also analyzed their monitoring system using two different databases. First comes from MIT Physionet database i.e., the MIT-BIH sinus rhythm and the MIT-St. Petersburg. While the second database was collected after monitoring 30 people who were asked to use these wearable sensors. After analyzing the performance of the proposed scheme, the obtained results for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 99.02%, 98.78%, and 99.17%, respectively. The achieved results concluded that the proposed system was quite reliable, robust, and valuable. Also, the data analysis revealed that this system was very convenient and ensured data security. In addition, this developed monitoring system generated warning messages, directed towards the patients and the doctors, during some critical situation.
