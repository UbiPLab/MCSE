AB Suppression of H-2-cooling in early protogalaxies has important implications for the formation of supermassive black hole seeds, the first generation of stars and the epoch of reionization. This suppression can occur via photodissociation of H-2 (by ultraviolet Lyman-Werner [LW] photons) or by photodetachment of H, a precursor in H-2 formation (by infrared [IR] photons). Previous studies have typically adopted idealized spectra, with a blackbody or a power-law shape, in modelling the chemistry of metal-free protogalaxies, and utilized a single parameter, the critical UV flux, or J(crit), to determine whether H-2-cooling is prevented. This can be misleading, as independent of the spectral shape, there is a critical curve in the (k(LW), k(H)-) plane, where kLW and kH- are the H-2-dissocation rates by LW and IR photons, which determines whether a protogalaxy can cool below similar to 1000 K. We use a one-zone model to follow the chemical and thermal evolution of gravitationally collapsing protogalactic gas, to compute this critical curve and provide an accurate analytical fit for it. We improve on previous works by considering a variety of more realistic Pop III or Pop II-type spectra from population synthesis models and perform fully frequency- dependent calculations of the H-2- photodissociation rates for each spectrum. We compute the ratio kLW/ kH- for each spectrum, as well as the minimum stellar mass M-*, for various IMFs and metallicities, required to prevent cooling in a neighbouring halo a distance d away. We provide critical M-*/d(2) values for suppression of H-2-cooling, with analytic fits, which can be used in future studies.
