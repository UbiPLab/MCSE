AB By storing data files in the cloud, users can make use of cloud computing techniques, thereby reducing hardware investment and simplifying data management. However, ensuring data integrity when using unreliable service providers is a problem. In this paper, we propose a novel method for provable data integrity (PDI) aimed at clients with data stored in untrusted servers in cloud computing environments. An advantage of this model is the low client cost since a constant amount of metadata is generated. Based on a bilinear group, we propose a simple, efficient audit service for public verification of untrusted outsourced storage. Compared with existing PDI methods, we aim to resolve this issue by considering the cost of generating verification metadata at the client. Furthermore, our method supports data dynamics and public verifiability. Finally, the results of extensive experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of our method demonstrate that our method achieves high efficiency.
