AB EVCE computing is an attractive network paradigm involving seamless connections among heterogeneous vehicular contexts. It will be a trend along with EVs becoming popular in V2X. The EVs act as potential resource infrastructures referring to both information and energy interactions, and there are serious security challenges for such hybrid cloud and edge computing. Context-aware vehicular applications are identified according to the perspectives of information and energy interactions. Blockchain-inspired data coins and energy coins are proposed based on distributed consensus, in which data contribution frequency and energy contribution amount are applied to achieve the proof of work. Security solutions are presented for securing vehicular interactions in EVCE computing.
