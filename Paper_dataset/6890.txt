AB Cloud computing is growing exponentially, whereby there are now hundreds of cloud service providers (CSPs) of various sizes. While the cloud consumers may enjoy cheaper data storage and computation offered in this multi-cloud environment, they are also in face of more complicated reliability issues and privacy preservation problems of their outsourced data. Though searchable encryption allows users to encrypt their stored data while preserving some search capabilities, few efforts have sought to consider the reliability of the searchable encrypted data outsourced to the clouds. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving STorage and REtrieval (STRE) mechanism that not only ensures security and privacy but also provides reliability guarantees for the outsourced searchable encrypted data. The STRE mechanism enables the cloud users to distribute and search their encrypted data across multiple independent clouds managed by different CSPs, and is robust even when a certain number of CSPs crash. Besides the reliability, STRE also offers the benefit of partially hidden search pattern. We evaluate the STRE mechanism on Amazon EC2 using a real world dataset and the results demonstrate both effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.
