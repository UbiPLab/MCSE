AB A novel scheme, called TerminalBooster, which aims at efficiently enhancing the performance of mobile terminals through computation offloading-enabled and data caching-enabled basestations, is proposed in this letter. Considering the intercommunications between mobile applications and their clouds, we design a collaborative offloading and caching model, formulate an optimization problem including two independent sub-problems, and develop a resource management algorithm which guides the basestation to jointly schedule computation offloading and allocate data caching. The total delays in app-cloud intercommunications can be minimized via optimal offloading and caching decisions. Simulation results demonstrate TerminalBooster can reach optimality efficiently and it outperforms traditional schemes with either offloading or caching.
