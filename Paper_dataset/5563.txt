AB Featured Application The methodology proposed in this paper may benefit industrials to better bridge the gap between business requirements and implementation requirements by using a tool merging modeling and simulation in the same phase. The modeling and simulation techniques proposed are based on a resource-perspective approach. With the emergence of big data and cloud technologies, companies now evolve in complex IT environments. This situation requires good practices for data process automation to be adopted to ensure system interoperability. Visual computing helps companies to describe and organize the ways in which information systems, devices, and people must interact. It incorporates a number of fields including modeling and simulation (M&S). This paper focused on M&S of data workflow processes that are key steps to bridging the gap between business views and goals on the one side, and operational implementations on the other side. Simulation adds a dynamic view to static modeling; it increases understanding of the behavior of process mechanisms and the identification of weak areas in data flow. Several research projects have been focused on control flow and data flow, but less attention has been paid to resource characteristics. This work is based on the MDSEA approach and the eBPMN language, and proposes an approach that aims to distinguish the types of resources carrying out process tasks. Furthermore, it introduces a new composite resource made from the relationship between a user (human resource) and a task form (IT resource). Moreover, it proposes a resource aggregation based on process performance combination in order to run and display a global performance measurement of a process path.
