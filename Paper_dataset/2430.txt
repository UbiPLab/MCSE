AB For most small and medium-sized enterprise (SME), the establishment of special customer management system requires specialized hardware and professional technicians, which will greatly increase the management cost of enterprises. Customer relationship management (CRM) based on cloud computing can not only reduce the management cost of SME, but also improve the business agility of SME, and help SME create new business models and market opportunities. In this study, a CRM system based on customer service is designed by using the customer classification method based on the improved K-means clustering algorithm. The system adopts the system architecture model based on network to realize the information interaction and resource sharing among different roles. The management of customer service is the core content of system design and development, and it realizes the development of CRM system for SME. The whole system effectively solves the problems such as low efficiency and limited service provision of customer management, as well as the low integrity of customer work, so as to achieve the purpose of improving the management capacity of SME.
