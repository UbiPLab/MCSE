AB The complex provider landscape in cloud computing makes incident handling difficult, as cloud service providers (CSPs) with end-user customers do not necessarily get sufficient information about incidents that occur at upstream CSPs. As part of the FP7 project 'A4Cloud', we have developed an incident management tool that can embed standard representation formats for incidents in notification messages, and a web-based dashboard for handling the incident workflow.
