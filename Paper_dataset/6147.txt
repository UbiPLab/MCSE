AB Cognitive radio is a promising technology that answers the spectrum scarcity problem arising from the growth of usage of wireless networks and mobile services. Cognitive radio network edge computing will enhance the CRN capabilities and, along with some adjustments in its operation, will be a key technology for 5G heterogeneous network deployment. This article presents current requirements and challenges in CRN, and a review of the limited research work on the CRN cloud, which will take off CRN capabilities and 5G network requirements and challenges. The article proposes a cognitive radio edge computing access server deployment for network service chaining at the access layer level.
