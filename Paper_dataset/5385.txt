ID ATTRIBUTE-BASED ENCRYPTION
AB To guarantee that electronic publications are accessible only to the authorized users via cloud, we propose an Efficient access control scheme (EACS) based on Attribute-based encryption (ABE), which is suitable for fine-grained access control. Compared with existing stateof-the-art schemes, EACS is more practical by following functions. Considering the factor that the user membership may change frequently, SACS has the capability of coping with dynamic membership efficiently. Arbitrary-State. is also supported to facilitate the system management and improve efficiency. Besides, we prove in the standard model that the security of EACS is based on the Decisional Bilinear Diffle-Hellman assumption. To evaluate the practicality of EACS, we provide a detailed theoretical performance analysis and a simulation comparison with existing schemes. Both the theoretical analysis and the experimental results show that our proposal is efficient and practical for electronic publishing under cloud environment.
