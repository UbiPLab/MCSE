DE Searchable symmetric encryption; Cloud computing; Wildcard search
AB Searchable encryption is an important technique that allows the data owners to store their encrypted data in the cloud. It also maintains the ability to search a keyword over encrypted data. In practice, searchable encryption scheme supporting wildcard search is very important and widely used. In this paper, we propose a new wildcard search technique to use one wildcard to represent any number of characters. Based on Bloom filter with a novel specified characters position technique, we construct a new searchable symmetric scheme to support wildcard search over encrypted data. This scheme is more efficient than prior schemes, and it can be strengthened to be secure against an adaptive attacker (CKA-2 security). Moreover, this scheme can be dynamic to support file addition and deletion. Our wildcard search technique is of independent interest.
