AB The researchers are using the various variations of re-encryption schemes, which migrate the computational intensive re-encryption jobs of mobile devices to the trusted entity/cloud. However, the messages are still encrypted and decrypted using the limited computational power of mobile devices.
   Our contribution in this paper is to propose a workload distribution model for re-encryption schemes, which offloads the computational intensive operations, such as encryption and decryption on a trusted entity. Moreover, the proposed workload distribution model is compared with existing re-encryption schemes of resource utilization on trusted entity and mobile device. The experimental results show substantial improvement in performance compared to the existing schemes.
