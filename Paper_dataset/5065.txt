AB Purpose This paper aims to investigate the key drivers of social media adoption intention by small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
   Design/methodology/approach It uses a multi-perspective framework combining technological, organizational and environmental elements affecting SMEs. Data were collected from a random sample of 1,700 SMEs operating in the UAE. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data.
   Findings The results showed that the technology construct had no significant effect on social media adoption, but both organization and environment constructs were significant.
   Research limitations/implications This has implications for social media experts and anyone wishing to encourage social media use by SMEs.
   Originality/value Conceptually, it develops a suitable multi-perspective framework covering various factors that may affect social media use. It also tests the framework empirically on a sample of SMEs from the UAE.
