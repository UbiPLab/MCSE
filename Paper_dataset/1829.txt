AB Facing the development of future 5G, the emerging technologies such as Internet of things, big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence is enhancing an explosive growth in data traffic. Radical changes in communication theory and implement technologies, the wireless communications and wireless networks have entered a new era. Among them, wireless big data (WBD) has tremendous value, and artificial intelligence (AI) gives unthinkable possibilities. However, in the big data development and artificial intelligence application groups, the lack of a sound theoretical foundation and mathematical methods is regarded as a real challenge that needs to be solved. From the basic problem of wireless communication, the interrelationship of demand, environment and ability, this paper intends to investigate the concept and data model of WBD, the wireless data mining, the wireless knowledge and wireless knowledge learning (WKL), and typical practices examples, to facilitate and open up more opportunities of WBD research and developments. Such research is beneficial for creating new theoretical foundation and emerging technologies of future wireless communications.
