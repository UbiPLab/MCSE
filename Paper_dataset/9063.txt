AB The provable data possession (PDP) scheme is vital to data-oriented mobile cloud computing security architecture. Without an efficient PDP scheme, users cannot verify whether the server retrieves original data before the data is being processed. One big issue of recent PDP verification schemes is that computation complexity and space overheads are very high. In this paper, we develop 2 comprehensive mobile provable data possession schemes (MPDP) using a hash tree data structure and a Boneh-Lynn-Shacham short signature scheme. Our MPDP schemes support data dynamics via verification out-sourcing, blockless verification, stateless verification, and dynamic data operations. Experimental results show that these 2 MPDP schemes are highly accurate in the data verification process, and have a low data transmission cost. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
