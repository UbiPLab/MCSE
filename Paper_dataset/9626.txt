AB Due to the significant advancement of Smartphone technology, the applications targeted for these devices are getting more and more complex and demanding of high power and resources. Mobile cloud computing (MCC) allows the Smart phones to perform these highly demanding tasks with the help of powerful cloud servers. However, to decide whether a given part of an application is cost-effective to execute in local mobile device or in the cloud server is a difficult problem in MCC. It is due to the trade-off between saving energy consumption while maintaining the strict latency requirements of applications. Currently, 5th generation mobile network (5G) is getting much attention, which can support increased network capacity, high data rate and low latency and can pave the way for solving the computation offloading problem in MCC. In this paper, we design an intelligent computation offloading system that takes tradeoff decisions for code offloading from a mobile device to cloud server over the 5G network. We develop a metric for tradeoff decision making that can maximize energy saving while maintain strict latency requirements of user applications in the 5G system. We evaluate the performances of the proposed system in a test-bed implementation, and the results show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, computation and energy saving.
