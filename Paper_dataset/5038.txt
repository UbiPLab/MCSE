AB The paper begins with a short presentation of Smart Grid (SG) being the starting element of a chain of developing the idea of "smartness" not only in power but also in all industry branches implying growth of data generation (Big Data problem). Parallel to the smart- and the big data problems, new informatics tools, such as Cloud Computing (CC) and Internet of Things (IoT) are developed. The main part of the paper describes specifics of these new tools, (e.g. Industrial Internet of Things, dew- and fog CC) and their collaboration in terms of solving the big data problem. Final remarks present the Author's view on further development of these problems.
