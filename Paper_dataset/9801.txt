AB Cloud computing technology offers the possibility of inter-organizational medical data sharing at a larger scale. The different organizations can maintain their own cloud environment while exchanging healthcare data among them in a peer-to-peer(P2P) fashion according to some defined polices. However, there are many security and privacy challenges that hamper the adoption of cloud computing solutions in healthcare domain. Besides, due to the privacy sensitivity of healthcare data, an organization may not wish to disclose its identity to others when exchanging data in the network to avoid different attacks by the intruders. Hence, anonymously authenticated data exchange is essential between the different peer organizations. In this paper we propose an anonymous on-the-fly secure data exchange protocol for such environment based on pairing-based cryptography. Our proposed solution allows cloud peers to dynamically generate temporary identities that are used to produce a session key for each session of data exchange. The proposed protocol is robust against different attacks, such as target-oriented, man-in-the middle, masquerade, and message manipulation attacks.
