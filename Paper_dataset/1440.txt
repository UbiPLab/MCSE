AB Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) is one of the most famous fruitful authentication services for cloud deployment to the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model. It is a third party approach for identity management, including creation, authentication, and privacy assurance. In this paper, the Virtual Identity (V-ID), as a new realization for IDaaS terminology which can be used in virtual environments, is proposed to improve the user privacy and to provide the anonymous Single sign-on (SSO) in such types of distributed environments. Actually, two V-ID frameworks based on the Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) and Pseudonym-Based Encryption (PBE) approaches are proposed and then implemented using MIRACL library. The V-ID approaches performance is evaluated analytically by implementing a mathematical model based on BCMP (Baskett Chandy Muntz Palacios) queuing model. In addition, a simulation-based evaluation using OPNET Modeler is introduced to compare the analytical-based BCMP queuing model against the OPNET simulation results. Moreover, the proposed approaches are compared against state-of-the-art work.
