DE Opportunistic and delay tolerant networks; Mobile computing systems
AB Mobile devices are often expected to perform computational tasks that may be beyond their processing or battery capability. Cloud computing techniques have been proposed as a means to offload a mobile device's computation to more powerful resources. In this paper, we consider the case where powerful computing resources are employed on a vehicle. This vehicle can be re-positioned in real time to receive computational tasks from user-carried devices. This scenario finds application in challenged environments and may be used in a military or disaster relief setting. It is further enabled by increasing feasibility of constructing a Mobile High Performance Computer (MHPC) using rugged computer hardware with form factors that can be deployed in vehicles. By analogy to prior work on message ferries and data mules, one can refer to the use of MHPCs as computational ferrying. After illustrating and motivating the computational ferrying concept, we turn our attention into the challenges facing such a deployment. These include the well-known challenges of operating an opportunistic and intermittently connected network using message ferries - such as devising an efficient mobility plan for MHPCs and developing techniques for proximity awareness. In this paper, first we propose an architecture for the system components to be deployed on the mobile users and the MHPCs. We then focus on defining and solving the MHPC movement scheduling problem with sufficient generality to describe a number of plausible deployment scenarios. We conduct a number of experiments that provide an understanding of how the performance of the system using MHPCs is affected by various parameters. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
