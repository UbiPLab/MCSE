AB In this paper, a novel scheme is proposed for multi-sourced signal fusion and secure processing. Within a distributed compressed sensing (DCS) framework, traditional sampling, compression and encryption for signal acquisition are unified under the secure multiparty computation protocol. In the proposed scheme, generation of the pseudo-random sensing matrix offers a natural method for data encryption in DCS, allowing for joint recovery of multiparty data at legal users' side. Experimental analysis and results indicate that the secure signal processing and recovery in DCS domain is feasible, and requires fewer measurements than the achievable approach of separate CS and Nyquist processing. The proposed scheme can be also extended to other cloud-based collaborative secure signal processing and data-mining applications.
