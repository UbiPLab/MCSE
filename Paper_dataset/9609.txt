AB Advances in mobile computing along with recent emerging technologies such as the smart grid and cloud computing are paving the way for a wide range of mobile cloud networking services and applications. In the smart grid cyber-physical environment, smart mobile devices communicate with the smart grid ecosystem via the control center, which plays a central role in selling and buying energy from smart grid users. The smart grid cyber-physical system can be viewed as a hierarchical architecture made up of a cyber plane and a physical plane. All smart devices reside in the physical plane, whereas in the cyber plane computing and communication resources are provided by the cloud server-based control center in smart grid. We propose an intelligent, energy-efficient scheme in smart grid cyber-physical systems using coalition-based game theory. All smart devices located at the physical plane are taken as the players in the coalition game. We developed a payoff function for each player in the coalition game based on transmission of information and service delays using conditional entropy for various smart devices at the physical plane. We analyzed the existence of the Nash equilibrium with incomplete information using various actions performed by the players in the game in the proposed scheme. Finally, we evaluated the performance of our proposed solution using performance evaluation metrics such as energy difference, overhead generated, and delay incurred.
