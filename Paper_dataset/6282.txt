AB The Internet of Things could be a recent computing paradigm, defined by networks of extremely connected things - sensors, actuators and good objects - communication across networks of homes, buildings, vehicles, and even individuals whereas cloud computing could be ready to keep up with current processing and machine demands. Fog computing provides architectural resolution to deal with some of these issues by providing a layer of intermediate nodes what's referred to as an edge network [26]. These edge nodes provide interoperability, real-time interaction, and if necessary, computational to the Cloud. This paper tries to analyse different fog computing functionalities, tools and technologies and research issues.
