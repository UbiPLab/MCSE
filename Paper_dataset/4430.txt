AB Cloud computing has become an indispensable infrastructure that provides multi-granularity services to support large applications in the Industrial Internet of Things (HOT), Cloud data centers have been built or extensively enlarged to cope with the growing computation and storage requirements of HOT. The energy consumption of cloud data centers is dramatically increasing, which has created a lot of problems with greenhouse gas emissions and service costs. Server consolidation is a popular approach to reduce cloud data centers' energy consumption by minimizing the number of active physical machines. Most of the extant research has focused on server reduction in the consolidation process, but unbalanced resource utilization among different physical machines can cause the waste of physical resources. This paper proposes a resource utilization-aware energy efficient server consolidation algorithm (RUAEE) that can be used to improve resource utilization while reducing the number of virtual machine live migrations. Experimental results show that RUAEE can reduce the energy. consumption and service-level agreement (SLA) violation in cloud data center.
