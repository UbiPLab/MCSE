AB The last few years have seen the great potential of artificial intelligence (AI) technology to efficiently and effectively deal with an incredible deluge of data generated by the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. If all the massive data is transferred to the cloud for intelligent processing, it not only brings considerable challenges to the network bandwidth but also cannot meet the needs of AI applications that require fast and real-time response. Therefore, to achieve this requirement, mobile or multiaccess edge computing (MEC) is receiving a substantial amount of interest, and its importance is gradually becoming more prominent. However, with the emerging of edge intelligence, AI also suffers from several tremendous security threats in AI model training, AI model inference, and private data. This paper provides three novel defense strategies to tackle malicious attacks in three aspects. First of all, we introduce a cloud-edge collaborative antiattack scheme to realize a reliable incremental updating of AI by ensuring the data security generated in the training phase. Furthermore, we propose an edge-enhanced defense strategy based on adaptive traceability and punishment mechanism to effectively and radically solve the security problem in the inference stage of the AI model. Finally, we establish a system model based on chaotic encryption with the three-layer architecture of MEC to effectively guarantee the security and privacy of the data during the construction of AI models. The experimental results of these three countermeasures verify the correctness of the conclusion and the feasibility of the methods.
