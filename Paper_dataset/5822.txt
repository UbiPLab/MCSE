AB This paper describes the development and plans for the implementation of a cloud-based logistics platform to enable and optimize cross-border shipping, using the China Railway Express (CR Express) in the context of China's recent One Belt and One Road (OBOR) initiative as an example of an extremely complex system that is running at suboptimal efficiency. We design a cross-border logistics information cloud platform (CLICP) and its architecture. The proposed CLICP comprises a hybrid cloud model with three layers of cloud services. We also examine the CLICP's operation and the design of the platform's functions, including core business and value-added service functions, such as real-time bidding, freight information push, and carrier one-stop service management functions. Finally, we propose a model for deploying our CLICP. Our study makes a significant contribution to the literature because of its hybrid cloud model architecture and for the completeness of its functionality. The study also has a good application prospect for the operation of CR Express and will play a better supporting role in cross-border logistics.
