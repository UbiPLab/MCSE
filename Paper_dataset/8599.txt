AB Based on current Internet technologies, several mobile technologies have been developed. The advancement of information technology has generated diverse and innovative environment in our daily environments being related to the future of the Internet. Service innovations are being made in network access technologies, user terminals, devices, applications, and the provision of services. Therefore, the future of the Internet will support flexible, real-time services and operation management that gives users more economic, ubiquitous, and high-quality experience. However, in an Internet of Things (IoT) network environment that is composed of a wide range of devices, the efficiency of executing applications will be affected by unfavorable network environments and the use of equipment. To solve this problem, a network service quality management design, in which the applications of the upper layer are unaffected by changes in the bottom layer, ensuring service quality, must be developed. This work proposes and concentrates on solutions named operation, administration and maintenance (OA&M) architecture that are based on cloud computing and IoT environment architecture. This study gives simulation results to show that this approach is efficient with an average communication delay of 591 milliseconds and a reduction in the data duplicate rate by 81.45%.
