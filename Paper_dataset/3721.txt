AB Cloud computing is one of the most successful technologies that offer on-demand services through the Internet. However, datacenters of the clouds may not have unlimited capacity which can fulfill the demanded services in peak hours. Therefore, scheduling workloads across multiple clouds in a federated manner has gained a significant attention in the recent years. In this paper, we present four task scheduling algorithms, called CZSN, CDSN, CDN and CNRSN for heterogeneous multi-cloud environment. The first two algorithms are based on traditional normalization techniques, namely z-score and decimal scaling respectively which are hired from data mining. The next two algorithms are based on two newly proposed normalization techniques, called distribution scaling and nearest radix scaling respectively. All the proposed algorithms are shown to work on-line. We perform rigorous experiments on the proposed algorithms using various synthetic as well as benchmark datasets. Their performances are evaluated through simulation run by measuring two performance metrics, namely makespan and average cloud utilization. The experimental results are compared with that of existing algorithms to show the efficacy of the proposed algorithms.
