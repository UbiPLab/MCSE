AB Cloud computing and Internet of Things encompass various physical devices that generate and exchange data with services promoting the integration between the physical world and computer-based systems. This work presents a novel Future Internet cloud service for data collection from Internet of Things devices in an automatic, generalized and modular way. It includes a flexible API for managing devices, users and permissions by mapping data to users, publish and subscribe context data as well as storage capabilities and data processing in the form of NoSQL big data. The contributions of this work include the on the fly data collection from devices that is stored in cloud scalable databases, the vendor agnostic Internet of Things device connectivity (since it is designed to be flexible and to support device heterogeneity), and finally the modularity of the event based publish/subscribe service for context oriented data that could be easily utilized by third party services without worrying about how data are collected, stored and managed.
