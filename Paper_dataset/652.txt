AB With the emergence of next-generation fiber materials and the development of sensors and wearable technologies, new breakthroughs also emerge in the field of wearable fabrics. By combining wearable fabrics with sensors, artificial intelligence and other technologies, the new intelligent fabrics create an intelligent, flexible and adaptive performance, thus meeting people's needs better and becoming more acceptable to users than traditional fabrics. Nevertheless, present intelligent fabrics have some shortcomings, such as insufficient interactive ability, the narrow scope of applications, and poor ability in synchronizing physical and psychological health data. Therefore, in this article, we propose the Living with I-Fabric system, which represents smart living powered by intelligent fabric and deep analytics. The proposed system is capable of solving problems that are beyond the scope of existing fabrics and further improve the user's experience. Combining multiple smart accessories and cognitive devices, together with smartphones and multi-level clouds, the proposed system builds a comprehensive and sustainable health monitoring and guidance ecosystem. Through AI algorithms on the edge and remote clouds, the user's historical data is analyzed in depth, and additional valued function services can be provided for users.
