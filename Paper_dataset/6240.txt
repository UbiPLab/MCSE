AB Building business processes by Web services in cloud computing has become the hotspot of service applications. Due to the complexity and uncertainty of business environment, QoS violations of service processes often take place at run-time. To rapidly recover from failures and minimize their impacts on the original execution plan of service processes, dynamic service selection is urgently needed once potential QoS violations are detected. However, existing research works do not fully investigate QoS constraints and inter-service correlations, as well as the breach penalty caused by service adjustment. In this paper, we present a new cooperative coevolutionary approach for dynamic service selection with QoS constraints and inter-service correlations. First, a novel formal model for the dynamic service selection problem with QoS constraints and inter-service correlations is presented. Second, a Double Information based Cooperative Coevolutionary algorithm (DICC) is proposed which uses Potter's cooperative coevolutionary framework and provides both local and global knowledge for the dynamic service selection optimization. Finally, we develop a prototype system to apply our approach and adopt different test cases to show that our DICC approach performs more effectively and efficiently than existing algorithms.
