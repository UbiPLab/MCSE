ID MOBILE
AB Fog computing has emerged as a promising solution for the loT and next generation mobile networks. As an extension to cloud computing, it enables service provisioning along the continuum from the cloud to things to reduce latency and bandwidth demands, and empower end users in their vicinity. Such a cloud-to-thing service continuum requires full technology support in infrastructure, platform, software and service levels. This article proposes FA(2)ST and its architecture to underpin a multi-level system of fog computing services for end-to-end support of loT applications. It presents the concept of FA(2)ST and describes its architecture, main features, a use case in a vertical industry, and a performance study.
