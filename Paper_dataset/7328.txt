AB Cloud computing has revolutionized the world's approach to providing computing services. Cloud computing has provided numerous advantages like quick deployment, cost efficiencies, pay as you go, flexibility, and the ability to work from anywhere and at any time. The number of providers of cloud computing has increased rapidly around the world. It, therefore, has become difficult for customers to decide which provider has the ability to fulfill the customer's requirements as well as determining what to base their selection on. Currently, there are studies for the evaluation and ranking of cloud based services based on their ability to meet the user requirements. This paper culminates previous studies as well as current research to form a method of evaluation and ranking. This paper will begin by presenting the necessary background by introducing cloud computing and multi-criteria decision making MCDM. Then evaluate a subset of papers [45] which represent the majority of researches proposed in the field of service evaluation conducted over the last decade (2005 2014) based on our own taxonomy. The paper will conclude with highlights from the lessons from the past and directions for future research. Our goal is not only to analyze but also to compare and consolidate past research.
