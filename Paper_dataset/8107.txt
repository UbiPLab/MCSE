AB In case of large scale disaster, it is very important to collect disaster information and understand them to make decision at counter disaster headquarter (CDH). Existing disaster information gathering and sharing system based on geographic information system (GIS) cannot respond to deal with large scale disaster from the points of the scalability and operability. This paper introduces a new design of disaster state presentation system using large size and ultra definition displaying system in order to collect and share disaster state information to make decision for officers at the CDH. The proposed method displays both GIS based location information and multimedia information in parallel on the same display. These displayed disaster information are interactively controlled using workspace controller to display on tiled display wall (TDW). We designed and implemented our system as a prototype. Through performance evaluation, the effects and future works of our proposed system are discussed.
