DE speaker recognition; homomorphic encryption; SEAL library
AB In the recent years we have witnessed an emergence of cloud computing services, in all important fields. These services provide space for keeping huge amount of data, and also great computational power. But together with these huge benefits, some privacy concerns are raised, about how much trust could we have in the provided services. A solution to this problem comes from the perspective of using homomorphic encryption to store and process data in an encrypted form. In this paper, we present the implementation of a speaker recognition system, which preserves the privacy of the K known speaker models used for identification. Our approach uses for homomorphic operations the homomorphic library SEAL and a larger plaintext space, avoiding the large amount of ciphertexts caused by bit-wise encryption.
