AB This article addresses the challenges of a digital cloud environment when it comes to global scalability with a large number of remote servers and an unsecure public cloud, such as Amazon. The goal of the study was to work out an approach for evaluating the reasonable system capacity under heavy workload. For that purpose, Zabbix monitoring solution is used and business metrics are applied in relation to existing system ones. A prediction data model is proposed to compute the future forecast of the user activity based on the collected historical statistics and to verify whether capacity adjustment is possible or not. The results of capacity planning are implemented at Genesys International Telecommunications Company. System analysis of the production environment indicates the possibility to downscale the capacity of certain virtual servers, which allowed savings to the annual operational costs of $3500 (50%) for each affected server.
