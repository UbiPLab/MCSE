AB With the advancement of Cloud computing, the adoption of cloud service in various industries is fast increasing. This is evident in the healthcare domain where the adoption is on the rise recently. However, the research contribution in this domain has been limited to certain functions. While cloud can increase availability, reachability of services, it is critical to design the healthcare service before provisioning. Besides, it is important to formulate Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to ensure that consumers can get guaranteed service from the service provider. The objective of this paper is to design the cloud based smart services for patient diagnostics. This research specifically defines service architecture for patients, physicians and diagnostic centers. In order to measure the proposed services, metrics of each SLA parameter is described with its functional and non-functional requirements. This paper also explains a case study implementation of a basic patient service using Google App Engine.
