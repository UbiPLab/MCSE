AB Internet of things (IoT) is a designation given to a technological system that can enhance possibilities of connectivity between people and things and has been showing to be an opportunity for developing and improving smart rehabilitation systems and helps in the e-Health area. Objective: to identify works involving IoT that deal with the development, architecture, application, implementation, use of technological equipment in the area of patient rehabilitation. Technology or Method: A systematic review based on Kitchenham's suggestions combined to the PRISMA protocol. The search strategy was carried out comprehensively in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Web of Science and Scopus databases with the data extraction method for assessment and analysis consist only of primary studies articles related to the IoT and Rehabilitation of patients. Results: We found 29 studies that addressed the research question, and all were classified based on scientific evidence. Conclusions: This systematic review presents the current state of the art on the IoT in health rehabilitation and identifies findings in interdisciplinary researches in different clinical cases with technological systems including wearable devices and cloud computing. The gaps in IoT for rehabilitation include the need for more clinical randomized controlled trials and longitudinal studies. Clinical Impact: This paper has an interdisciplinary feature and includes areas such as Internet of Things Information and Communication Technology with their application to the medical and rehabilitation domains.
