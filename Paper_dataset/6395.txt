ID VIRTUAL MACHINE CONSOLIDATION
AB Cloud-based data centers consume a significant amount of energy which is a costly procedure. Virtualization technology, which can be regarded as the first step in the cloud by offering benefits like the virtual machine and live migration, is trying to overcome this problem. Virtual machines host workload, and because of the variability of workload, virtual machines consolidation is an effective technique to minimize the total number of active servers and unnecessary migrations and consequently improves energy consumption. Effective virtual machine placement and migration techniques act as a key issue to optimize the consolidation process. In this paper, we present a novel virtual machine consolidation technique to achieve energy-QoS-temperature balance in the cloud data center. We simulated our proposed technique in CloudSim simulation. Results of evaluation certify that physical machine temperature, SLA, and migration technique together control the energy consumption and QoS in a cloud data center.
