AB To realize the bidirectional cognitive computing supported by cloud technology, the cloud model is taken as a bidirectional cognitive computing model based on probability and statistics, a bidirectional cognitive calculation method is constructed, and the bidirectional cognitive conversion between concept connotation and extension is studied. In view of the defects in the existing backward cloud conversion algorithm, two stable multistep backward cloud conversion algorithms are proposed, which lays the foundation for the realization of a stable bidirectional cognitive calculation process. A bidirectional cognitive computing model is proposed, which combines the characteristics of human cognition and the bidirectional cognitive conversion algorithm to simulate bidirectional cognitive computing process based on concept by means of calculation. Moreover, the application of bidirectional cognitive transform algorithm in image segmentation is studied combined with the characteristics of human image cognition. It is also compared with the classical algorithm and methods based on cloud model. The results show that the proposed method has lower mean error and is obviously better than other algorithms, which fully proves the effectiveness of the method. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.
