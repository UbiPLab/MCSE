AB Cloud computing needs service provider with reliable communication for increasing the user trust. As existence of cloud depends on quality of services, evaluation of this trust value needs to be carried out by the cloud. Many of the web services provided by E-commerce, social sites, digital platform maintain this for the faith of user by estimating the reliability of service provider. This paper focuses on a model that can identify real nodes by its behavior in cloud. Here fuzzy max interval values have been evaluated from the transactional behavior of the node in fixed interval. By increase in transaction count, trust value of real node trust increases and trust value of malicious nodes decreases. The work is based on Role based Access Control (RBAC), which has three type of roles (Admin, Data owner, Node). Data owner content security was achieved by AES algorithm and only trusted node can access those resources. Experiment was performed by carrying out simulations on ideal and environment under attack. Analysis of evaluation parameters values shows that proposed model of fuzzy max interval trust is better as compared to other existing Domain Partition Trust Model (DPTM), for identification of malicious nodes.
