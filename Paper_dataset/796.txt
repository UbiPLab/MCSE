AB To improve the energy-saving supervision level of urban buildings and reduce the urban energy consumption, this article proposes an intelligent energy-saving supervision system of the urban buildings based on the Internet of Things (IoT). Regarding the advantages and applications of the IoT, a layered framework of the intelligent energy-saving supervision system that integrates the IoT is constructed. In this framework, three key system layers, including the data acquisition based on the IoT, the data integration based on cloud computing, and the intelligent service based on data prediction, defect management and differential management, are separately implemented. On that basis, a case study is performed on a large public building named Campus Library of the South China University of Technology. After the three-year application in an intelligent and real-time supervision manner, the annual energy consumption of the studied building is reduced by 35%, which validates the practicability and effectiveness of the system proposed in this article.
