AB Content delivery through cloud networks has gained popularity due to the cloud's ability to provide on-demand services. However, composite services, such as customized multimedia content, introduce both delays and resource limitations if traditional cloud solutions are used. With recent advances in mobile edge computing, customized media delivery can be achieved through compositions of service specific overlays (SSOs). This paper presents a work flow-net-based mechanism for mobile edge node cooperation in fog-cloud networks to form guaranteed SSOs. The proposed solution uses a mathematical cooperation operator to turn the SSO composition problem expressed as workflow nets into algebraic representations. In turn, the minimal cost cooperative path from the workflow net is determined such that it guarantees the delivery of the requested composite media services to clients. Experimental results show that the composition process can be adequately established and carried out in a timely manner.
