AB In recent years, with microelectronics, computer, communications, and the other information technology applications in the medical and health cause has entered the new era of information. In the IT technology to every corner in the field of medical rapid extension and penetration of the today, the information system integration is becoming more and more an important hot spot in the study of medical informatisation. From the 1980s of the DICOM and HL7 of these industry standards, to the IHE founded in the 1990s, people have never stopped to enhance the communication between manufacturers, efforts to make medical institutions more efficient. To deal with the challenges, this paper designs and implements the novel medical cloud database service system based on the parallel and the mobile computing. We integrate the parallel and the mobile computing techniques to enhance the system to achieve the goal of obtaining higher robustness and efficiency. The experimental result proves that our multicore parallel system can get higher robustness and efficiency. At the same time, the real-word user interface is demonstrated to provide the intuitive understanding.
