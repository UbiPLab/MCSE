AB Multi-Robot Systems (MRS) is a field of Robotic that develops robots to act as a team, with coordination, performing task collaboratively. These systems are used to deal with complex tasks, in which time and space are restricted. To achieve the correct operation of the MRS the communication skills is a fundamental point to be investigated. This paper presents Architecture of communication based on cloud computing technology for a MRS composed by CellBots. The proposed architecture aims to optimize the use of the robots resources in order to provide an efficient collaborative environment. Some preliminary metrics have been analysed to show the feasibility of the proposed framework.
