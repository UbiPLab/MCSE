AB Today, networks connect computing resources, front devices, and applications that are scattered across many places, including those on-premise and in the cloud, allowing people and society as a whole to enjoy diverse services. However, a failure or degradation of a network has the potential to cause considerable problems to connected devices and services. To prevent these risks, a "conscious" network system with autonomous operation and maintenance capabilities will be required. Such a system will detect the slightest irregularities in the network as early signs of errors and prevent possible failures or degradation from occurring. It will also ensure that the services remain available without having to modify end users' systems or make users aware of the network problems. To realize such systems, Fujitsu has been working on development of the technologies necessary for integrated network monitoring: detection of early signs through Internet Protocol (IP) packet behavior analysis and optical transport signal quality monitoring, optical wavelength reassignment, and self-diagnosis for IP networks. This paper describes these technologies required for the realization of the conscious network.
