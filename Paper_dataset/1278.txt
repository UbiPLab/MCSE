AB The fast progression of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has resulted in a large number of vehicles connecting to networks. This leads to massive growth in the data collected from vehicles via IoV. Fortunately, cloud computing provides a vast range of services such as operating systems, hardware, software, and resources. Therefore, the massive amount of data cumulated through IoV can be outsourced to the cloud. However, considering the untrusted nature of the cloud, the cumulated data must be encrypted before it is outsourced to the cloud server. Unfortunately, this ensures to difficulty while searching the data. To address this challenge, an efficient certificateless public key cryptography with equality test (CL-PKC-ET) is presented in this paper. In this scheme, the authorized cloud server has the permission to execute the equality test on encrypted data and retrieve the result without knowing any relevant information about the ciphertext. Our CL-PKC-ET scheme is demonstrated under the Bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption in the random oracle model. Ultimately, we compare the CL-PKE-ET with a state-of-art scheme and the performance evaluation indicates that our scheme accomplishes 96.40%, 32.08%, and 43.98% reduction in computation costs during the encryption, decryption, and test stages, respectively. Therefore, we assert that our scheme is ideal for deployment in both the cloud and IoV environments.
