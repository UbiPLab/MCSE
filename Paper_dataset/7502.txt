AB The ubiquity of smartphones makes the mobile crowdsourcing possible, where the requester (task owner) can crowdsource data from the workers (smartphone users) by using their sensor-rich mobile devices. However, data collection, data aggregation, and data analysis have become challenging problems for a resource constrained requester when data volume is extremely large, i.e., big data. In particular to data analysis, set operations, including intersection, union, and complementation, exist in most big data analysis for filtering redundant data and preprocessing raw data. Facing challenges in terms of limited computation and storage resources, cloud-assisted approaches may serve as a promising way to tackle the big data analysis issue. However, workers may not be willing to participate if the privacy of their sensing data and identity are not well preserved in the untrusted cloud. In this paper, we propose to the use cloud to compute a set operation for the requester, at the same time workers' data privacy and identities privacy are well preserved. Besides, the requester can verify the correctness of set operation results. We also extend our scheme to support data preprocessing, with which invalid data can be excluded before data analysis. By using batch verification and data update methods, the proposed scheme greatly reduces the computational cost. Extensive performance analysis and experiment based on real cloud system have shown both the feasibility and efficiency of our proposed scheme.
