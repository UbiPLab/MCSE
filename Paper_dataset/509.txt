AB Fog computing is an emerging architectural paradigm for the implementation of the Internet of Things, where computation moves from cloud servers to network edges. Fog computing systems are with three characteristics: 1) low latency; 2) strong presence of real-time applications; and 3) reusability of end devices. Most existing designs of fog computing systems concentrate on reducing application processing latency, but neglect real-time requirements of applications and reusability of end devices, which may drastically degrade both functionality and quality-of-service (QoS) of applications. In this article, we investigate QoS optimization of real-time applications in fog computing systems equipped with reusable end devices and powered by hybrid energy of renewable generations and grid electricity. We propose a renewable-adaptive computation offloading approach. At the end device layer, local energy allocation schemes are designed at the application-level and component-level, where techniques of the cooperative game and mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) are leveraged, respectively. At the fog layer, the local energy allocation method is augmented to a local-remote scheduling solution by judiciously judging whether or not the computation offloading of an application needs to be triggered. The experimental results demonstrate that compared to benchmarking algorithms, our approach improves the overall and individual application QoS by up to 101.93% and 59.30%, respectively.
