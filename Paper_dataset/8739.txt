AB Recently, mobile cloud computing (MCC) has gained a lot of interest for researchers building the next-generation mobile applications. Because unauthorized access may cause serious problems, security and privacy with MCC have become significant issues. This paper addresses the secrecy dimming capacity of secure transmission in MCC over visible light communication (VLC) channels. By obtaining the entropy-maximizing symbol probability of multiple light emitting diode- (LED-) based pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), mathematical analysis of the secrecy dimming capacity of VLC was derived. Simulation results show that the secure transmission ability ofmulti-LED-based VLC is determined according to the number of activated LEDs and target dimming level. This can be a guideline for practical VLC-based mobile network designers intending to secure wireless transmission and to decide on the number of activated LEDs at target dimming level to operate.
