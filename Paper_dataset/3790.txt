AB The tremendous growth of virtualization technology in cloud environment reflects the increasing number of tasks that require the services of the virtual machines (VMs). To balance the load among the VMs and minimizing the makespan of the tasks are the challenging research issues. Many algorithms have been proposed to solve the said problem. However, they lack in finding the potential information about the resources and tasks and it may lead to the improper assignment of the tasks to the VMs. In this paper, we propose a new load balancing algorithm for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud. We devise an efficient strategy to configure the servers based on the number of incoming tasks and their sizes to find suitable VMs for assignment and maximize the utilization of computing resource. We test the proposed algorithm through simulation runs and compare the simulation results with the existing algorithms using various performance metrics. Through comparisons, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs better than the existing ones. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
