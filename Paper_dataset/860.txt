AB The pay-as-you-go model and network virtualization of cloud computing allow micro and small content businesses (MSCBs) who construct their integrated cloud service platforms (ICSPs) with virtual datacenters (VDCs) to serve their end users with low service latency and construction cost. However, designing a flexible VDC selection strategy to meet the demands of MSCBs is a challenging task. To address this problem, a dynamic VDC selection strategy is designed for MSCBs to construct their ICSPs flexibly with the VDCs from different clouds. To this end, three dynamic landmark selection metrics are proposed and applied to construct the network coordinates. Then, a dynamic VDC selection algorithm is presented to determine the locations and service resources of VDCs, which are purchased from different clouds by MSCBs to construct their ICSPs. Based on our VDC selection strategy, a simulator is developed based on our designed experimental framework to evaluate our VDC selection strategy. The experimental results show that compared with previous server placement strategies, our strategy can actively and effectively determine VDCs' locations and allocate service resources for each VDC with less computing consumption and is a practical VDC selection strategy for cloud construction in a multicloud environment.
