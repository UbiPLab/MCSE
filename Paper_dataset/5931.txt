AB A considerable amount of research has addressed Internet of Things and connected communities. It is possible to exploit the sensing capabilities of connected communities, by leveraging the continuously growing use of cloud computing solutions and mobile devices. The pervasiveness of mobile sensors also enables the Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) paradigm, which aims at using mobile-embedded sensors to extend monitoring of multiple (environmental) phenomena in expansive urban areas. In this article, we discuss our approach with a cloud-based platform to pave the way for applying crowd sensing in urban scenarios. We have implemented a complete solution for environmental monitoring of several pollutants, like noise, air, electromagnetic fields, and so on in an urban area based on this paradigm. Through extensive experimentation, specifically on noise pollution, we show how the proposed infrastructure exhibits the ability to collect data from connected communities, and enables a seamless support of services needed for improving citizens' quality of life and eventually helps city decision makers in urban planning.
