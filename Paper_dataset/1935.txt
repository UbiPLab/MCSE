AB The low computing power of mobile devices impedes the development of mobile applications with a heavy computing load. Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) has emerged as the solution to this by connecting mobile devices with the infinite computing power of the Cloud. As mobile devices typically communicate over untrusted networks, it becomes necessary to secure the communications to avoid privacy-sensitive data breaches. This paper presents work on implementing MCC applications with secure communications. For that purpose, we built on COMPSs-Mobile, a redesigned implementation of the COMP Superscalar (COMPSs) framework aiming to MCC platorms. COMPSs-Mobile automatically exploits the parallelism inherent in an application and orchestrates its execution on loosely-coupled distributed environment. To avoid a vendor lock-in, this extension leverages on the Generic Security Services Application Program Interface (GSSAPI) (RFC2743) as a generic way to access security services to provide communications with authentication, secrecy and integrity. Besides, GSSAPI allows applications to take profit of more advanced features, such as Federated Identity or Single Sign-On, which the underlying security framework could provide. To validate the practicality of the proposal, we use Kerberos as the security services provider to implement SSO; however, applications do not authenticate themselves and require users to obtain and place the credentials beforehand. To evaluate the performance, we conducted some tests running an application on a smartphone offloading tasks to a private cloud. Our results show that the overhead of securing the communications is acceptable.
