AB Cloud computing is emerging as one of the powerful computing technologies in the field of Information Technology due to its flexibility and cost reduction. This paper provides a detailed survey on security issues of the services provided by cloud computing and solutions to mitigate them. The main objective of this paper is to empower a new researcher to figure out the concepts of cloud computing, the services provided by them, and the security issues in the services. It also provides solutions to avoid or mitigate the different security issues which occur in the services provided by cloud computing. Additionally, it provides insight into the cloud computing model proposed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), data stages and data security basics in a multi-tenant environment. This paper explores the different security methods proposed by different researchers and analyzes them.
