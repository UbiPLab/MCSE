AB In recent years, the distributed applications in the upper layer are becoming more and more important, and the system is constantly upgrading. The cloud operating system provides technical support for the above mentioned "unification'', and the essence of cloud computing technology is the reasonable scheduling of resources with the rapid development of big data and cloud computing technology. This paper makes a thorough study on the Yam system, and designs a new scheduler Luna Scheduler. In the analysis of resource unified scheduling in cloud environment, the scheduler is optimized from Yam native Capacity Scheduler. The optimization includes scheduling algorithm, fine granularity resource partitioning, etc. Finally, a validated parameter configuration suggestion is given to improve the throughput of Yarn.
