AB The purpose is to construct smart park platform by using the Internet of Things technology, to realize the access of intelligent systems and equipment within park, and to effectively coordinate the various systems in the park. Taking advantage of the key technologies of Internet of Things and cloud computing, smart park information hardware architecture and technical solutions are put forward, the sensor and wireless Internet of Things are applied to realize the system. The experimental results showed that the system realizes the information sharing, exchange and fusion between the various sensing subsystems, and solves the information islands phenomenon that existed in the past. In conclusion, this system can meet the actual needs of smart park, and provides a certain reference for similar park construction.
