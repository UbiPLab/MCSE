ID POWER-CONSUMPTION
AB This study presents an architecture of green sensor mobile cloud computing which integrates sensor network and mobile network with cloud computing. In the proposed scheme, the sensor data are transmitted to the cloud through a mobile device. To develop the proposed architecture both the indoor and outdoor region are considered. For indoor region light weight access point and home node base station are used by the mobile device for sensor data transmission to the cloud, whereas for outdoor region macrocell and microcell base stations are used. Simulation results present that using home node base station the power consumption at indoor region can be reduced by similar to 10% than the light weight access point, and using microcell base station at outdoor region the power consumption can be reduced by similar to 30% than the macrocell base station. Hence, using home node base station and microcell base station green sensor mobile cloud computing can be obtained at indoor and outdoor regions, respectively. In this study, an experimental analysis of the proposed architecture is also performed.
