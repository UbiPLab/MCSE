AB Internet of Things (IoT) has taken place to motivate various intelligent applications with the data collected by the things". Meanwhile, Cloud computing offers an efficient and convenient way to store, process and analyze huge amount of data. Because a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) that is employed to store and process user private data is actually not in the trust domains of cloud users, data security becomes a serious issue in cloud computing. One crucial problem in cloud is the cloud data processing result may be incorrect, thus cannot be fully trusted. This calls for research to verify the correctness of data processing at the cloud in order to enhance its trustworthiness, especially for encrypted data processing. At present, various cryptosystems have been proposed to achieve verifiability with different characteristics and quality. However, the literature still lacks a thorough survey to review the current state of art in order to get a comprehensive view of this research field, named verifiable computation. In this paper, we review existing work of verifiable computation by comparing and discussing pros and cons according to performance requirements, highlight open research issues through serious review and analysis and propose a number of research directions in order to guide future research.
