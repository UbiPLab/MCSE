AB In this paper, we present Prius, a hybrid edge cloud and client adaptation framework for HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS) by taking advantage of the new capabilities empowered by recent advances in edge cloud computing. In particular, emerging edge clouds are capable of accessing an application layer and radio access networks (RANs) information in real time. Coupled with powerful computation support, an edge cloud-assisted strategy is expected to significantly enrich mobile services. Meanwhile, although HAS has established itself as the dominant technology for video streaming, one key challenge for adapting HAS to mobile cellular networks is in overcoming the inaccurate bandwidth estimation and unfair bitrate adaptation under the highly dynamic cellular links. Edge cloud-assisted HAS presents a new opportunity to resolve these issues and achieve systematic enhancement of quality of experience (QoE) and QoE fairness in cellular networks. To explore this new opportunity, Prius overlays a layer of adaptation intelligence at the edge cloud to finalize the adaptation decisions while considering the initial bandwidth-irrelevant bitrate selection at the clients. Prius is able to exploit RAN channel status, client device characteristics, and application-layer information in order to jointly adapt the bitrate of multiple clients. Prius also adopts a QoE continuum model to track the cumulative viewing experience and an exponential smoothing estimation to accurately estimate a future channel under different moving patterns. Extensive trace-driven simulation results show that Prius with hybrid edge cloud and client adaptation is promising under both slow and fast-moving environments. Furthermore, the Prius adaptation algorithm achieves a near-optimal performance that outperforms the exiting strategies.
