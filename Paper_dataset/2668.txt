AB We now have mounting evidences that the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies is polluted with metals processed through stars. The fate of these metals is however still an open question and several findings indicate that they remain poorly mixed. A powerful tool to study the low-density gas of the CGM is offered by absorption lines in quasar spectra, although the information retrieved is limited to 1D along the sightline. We report the serendipitous discovery of two close-by bright z(gal) = 1,148 extended galaxies with a fortuitous intervening z(abs) = 1.067 foreground absorber, MUSE IFU observations spatially probes kpc-scales in absorption in the plane of the sky over a total area spanning similar to 30 kpc(-2). We identify two [O II] emitters at z(abs) down to 21 kpc with SFR similar to 2 M-circle dot yr(-1), We measure small fractional variations (<30 per cent) in the equivalent widths of FeII and MgII it cold gas absorbers on coherence scales of 8 kpc but stronger variation on larger scales (25 kpc). We compute the corresponding cloud gas mass <2 x 10(9) M-circle dot. Our results indicate a good efficiency of the metal mixing on kpc-scales in the CGM of a typical z similar to 1 galaxy. This study show-cases new prospects for mapping the distribution and sizes of metal clouds observed in absorption against extended background sources with 3D spectroscopy.
