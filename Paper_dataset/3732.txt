AB To provide a high performance Internet of things (IoT) system by integrating cloud computing, data mining, and other intelligent methods to all the people has been a promising trend in recent years. However, the performance of such a system Is restricted by several factors, namely, various user requirements, various types of appliances, enormous need of communications, limited network bandwidth, and limited computation power. Considering these restrictions, IoT resource allocation problem (IRAP) is one of the most critical problems because a good solution to this problem will be very useful for enhancing the performance of such a system. That is why an effective algorithm will be presented in this paper for solving the IoT resource allocation problem of the Internet of things. The concepts of data clustering and metaheuristic are employed for the proposed algorithm to allocate the large-scale devices and gateways of IoT to reduce the total communication cost between them. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is significantly better than the other resource allocation algorithms compared in this paper in terms of the total data communication costs.
