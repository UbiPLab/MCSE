AB In the cloud computing environment, there is a low degree of data resource scheduling registration in the ship data resource scheduling system. In response to this problem, the ship network data resource scheduling system is designed in the cloud computing environment. First of all, design the overall scheduling structure of the system, secondly, design the ship network data resource characteristic shipping management module, through the resource manager to classify the data diversion, add the design of the ship network data resource interference filter processing module, realize the data resource interference filter processing, ensure the accurate deployment of data resources, and finally design the ship network data resource scheduling module, complete the data resource scheduling to achieve the system design. Through the simulation experiment, the ratio of the ship's network data resource scheduling system and the traditional data resource scheduling system is compared to prove that the design system is superior.
