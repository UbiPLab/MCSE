AB Cloud computing is a growing trend in many leading sectors. The task that challenges almost every progressing implementation is security and privacy. In earlier days, corporate/IT sectorswere facing more security challenges over the data. Especially in a centralized environment, unauthorized users can easily modify the data without the knowledge of the owner, i.e., security breach is unavoidable. So, it becomes mandatory to secure the data. The proposed model follows the decentralized architecture which does not depend on any third party system. In this model, the data security can be enhanced by using cyclic shift transposition algorithm. For a secure data transmission and retrieval, we use quick response code and hash-based timestamp so that the real-time attacks are stopped or prevented.
