AB In today's world of science and technology rapid development, technology innovation is increasingly become the key to competition between countries. Collaborative innovation of industry can effectively promote the knowledge accumulation and technological innovation. And thus it could promote the rapid development of national economy. Therefore, industry-university-research collaborative innovation has been widely recognized by countries in the world in awareness and action. And the collaborative innovation activities of industry-university-research institutes must rely on good operating mechanism as a guarantee. At present, there are many problems in the collaborative innovation mechanism of industry-university-research research. The information asymmetry between the cooperative subjects, the communication is not smooth. The sharing channel of technical resources is not smooth. And the resources cannot be effectively integrated. The incentive and restriction of the cooperative subjects are not enough. The consciousness of cooperation is not strong. The advent of the era of cloud computing, collaborative innovation of industry, the resource sharing, collaborative research and development, information sharing can have a better performance. Cloud computing and cloud service platform provides the production-study-research cooperative innovation mechanism to build solutions. Based on production, this article by the advantages of cloud computing, the cloud background production-study-research cooperative innovation mechanism, to be able to the efficient operation of collaborative innovation study provide a reliable guarantee.
