AB A semi-outsourcing privacy-preserving scheme is proposed in this paper for the IoT data collection named semi-outsourcing privacy-preserving (SOPP), which supports delegated identity authentication for the IoT devices without revealing the transmitted data. Compared with other schemes that implement the authentication based upon using trusted cloud services, the design of our scheme SOPP can achieve the delegated authentication on untrusted public clouds while providing privacy-preserving data transmission. Meanwhile, the implemented one-way authentication can reduce the communication cost for the IoT devices (especially for the low-resource ones) to prolong their battery life. The performance of the SOPP scheme is demonstrated for its use in the resource-constrained IoT devices and compared with a benchmark trusted cloud scheme including one based upon certificates and an interactive (two-way) authentication scheme.
