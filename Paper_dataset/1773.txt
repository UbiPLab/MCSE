AB Micellization and clouding behaviors of an anionic gemini surfactant, phosphoric acid, P, P'-14-butanedieyl P, P'-didodecyl ester, disodium salt (12-4-12A), in aqueous solution, have been investigated in the presence of a surface active ionic liquid (SAIL), tetra n-pentylammonium bromide (TPeAB). Critical micelle concentration and H-1 NMR data show synergistic interactions/intercalation of n-pentyl chain between the 12-4-12A monomers constituting the micelle, respectively. 12-4-12A + TPeAB system showed the cloud point (CP) at distinctly lower [12-4-12A]. Amino acid/cyclodextrin has been used to tune the CP. DLS and TEM data suggest the formation of n-pentyl chain (of the SAIL) mediated linked aggregates whose size decreases with lowering [TPeAB] while compactness increases by beta-CD. POM data showed that larger aggregates are formed near the CP. This may be due to increased hydrophobic interactions (between dodecyl chains of the gemini and pentyl chains of the TPeAB) and decreased electrostatic repulsion (as indicated by lowering zeta-potential value at CP). Mixtures, with or without beta-CD, are used for solubilization/co-solubilization of polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs-anthracene, pyrene or fluorene). Molar solubilization ratio (MSR) has been computed using UV-Visible spectrophotometry. The percentage MSR value increases in order: Anthracene > Pyrene > Fluorene in comparison to pure 12-4-12A Cloud point extraction of anthracene shows that it concentrates similar to 93% in surfactant rich phase (SRP). However, anthracene content decreases (similar to 80%) when the system contains beta-CD. GZrO(2) nanocomposite has shown nearly complete adsorption of anthracene. Strategies, like mixed micellization, tuning of clouding and co-solubilization, can enhance solubility/bioavailability, extraction and subsequent degradation of PAHs from the aquatic/soil environment.
