AB The advent of the Cloud and the popularization of mobile devices have led us to a shift in computing access where users have an interactive display, and heavy computations run remotely, in the Cloud servers. COMPSs-Mobile is a framework that aims to ease the development of energy-efficient and high-performing applications for this kind of environment. The framework provides an infrastructure-unaware programming model that allows developers to code regular Android applications whose computation is transparently parallelized and partially offloaded to remote resources. This paper gives an overview of the programming model and describes the internal components of the toolkit which supports it focusing on the offloading and checkpointing mechanisms. It also presents the results of some tests conducted to evaluate the behavior of the solution and to measure the potential benefits in Android applications.
