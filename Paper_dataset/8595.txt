AB With the ubiquitous penetration of Internet of Things new applications are expected to benefit from bringing the cloud close to the network edge. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) allows monitoring radio access network and provides critical information related to users and cells to analytic real-time applications. Deployment of MEC applications may be facilitated by existence of horizontal service platforms enabling MEC application orchestration. In this paper, the MEC service for bandwidth management is studied. Generic functionality is explored and semantic data annotation is synthesized. An approach to describe applications based on semantic annotation and a method for automatic detection and resolution of undesired interaction between MEC applications are proposed.
