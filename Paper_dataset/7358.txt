ID IDENTITY-BASED ENCRYPTION
AB Fuzzy techniques can implement the fine-grained access control of encrypted data in the Cloud because they support error-tolerance. In this system, using biometric attributes such as fingerprints, faces and irises as pubic parameters is advantageous over those systems based on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). This is because biometric information is unique, unforgettable and non-transferable. However the biometric-attribute measurements are noisy and most of the existing encryption systems can not support the biometric-attribute encryption. Additionally, the previous fuzzy encryption schemes only achieve the selective security which is a weak security model. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a new fuzzy encryption scheme based on the lattice in this letter. The proposed scheme is based on a hierarchical identity-based encryption with fixed-dimensional private keys space and thus has short public parameters and short private keys, which results in high computation efficiency. Furthermore, it achieves the strong security, i.e., adaptive security. Lastly, the security is reduced to the learning with errors (LWE) problem in the standard model.
