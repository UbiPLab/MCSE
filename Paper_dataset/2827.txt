AB Recently, internet of things (IoT) technologies have progressed, but IoT maintenance applications are not widespread in Japan yet because of insufficient analyses of real-time situations and the high costs of configuring failure detection rules and collecting sensing data. In this paper, using lambda architecture concept, we propose a maintenance platform on which edge nodes analyze sensing data, detect anomalies and extract a new detection rule in real time, and a cloud orders maintenance automatically.
