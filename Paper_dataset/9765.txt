AB With advent of new technologies, we are surrounded by several tiny but powerful mobile devices through which we can communicate with the outside world to store and retrieve data from the Cloud. These devices are considered as smart objects as they can sense the medium, collect data, interact with nearby smart objects, and transmit data to the cloud for processing and storage through internet. Internet of Things (loT) create an environment for smart home, health care and smart business decisions by transmitting data through internet. Cloud computing, on the other hand leverages the capability of loT by providing computation and storage power to each smart object. Researches and developers combine the cloud computing environment with that of loT to reduce the transmission and processing, cost in the cloud and to provide better services for processing and storing the realtime data generated from those IoT devices. In this paper, a novel framework is designed for the Cloud to manage the realtime loT data and scientific non-loT data. In order to demonstrate the services in Cloud, real experimental result of implementing the Docker container for virtualization is introduced to provide Software as a Service (SaaS) in a hybrid cloud environment.
