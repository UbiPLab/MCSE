AB The rapid growth in demand for getting various services combined with dynamic and diverse nature of requests initiated in cloud environments have led to the establishment of huge data centers which consume a vast amount of energy. On the other hand, in order to attract more users in dynamic business cloud environments, providers have to provide high quality of service for their customers based on defined Service Level Agreement (SLA) contracts. Hence, in order to maximize their revenue, resource providers need to minimize both energy consumptions and SLA violations simultaneously. This study proposes a new six-phase procedure for on-line resource management process. More precisely, this study proposes addition of two new phases to the default on-line resource management process including VM sorting phase and condition evaluation phase. Moreover, this paper shows the deficiencies of present resource management methods which fail to consider all effective system parameters as well as their importance, and do not have load prediction models. The results of simulations using cloudSim simulator validates the applicability of our proposed algorithms in reducing energy consumption as well as decreasing SLA violations and number of VMs' migration in cloud data centers.
