AB Cloud computing is an emerging technology that facilitates companies in the IT sector and Education Sector. Authorization is a major security concern in any organization. The small organization is not interested to implement bulky access controls that are utilized a large amount of bandwidth and cost. In this paper, we had analyzed the problem of authorization computation complexity and so we give an efficient light weighted authorization method. Authorization process involves number of rules validation before providing access to resources. We propose an Authorization process that is less complex then exiting Authorization access control methods, in which we use predicate logic rule set, which reduce the policy misinterpretations and policy misconfigurations. In which we enable the architecture with fixed policy rules and user-defined policy rules. We did target the small organization for design this framework. In this paper we consider case study of educational system and in which we find better results than other authorization systems.
