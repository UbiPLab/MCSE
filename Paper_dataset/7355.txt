AB Cloud computing technique has become an unavoidable technology in current IT world and now all the IT enterprises have switched from client-server technology to cloud technology. The underlying architecture of cloud is virtualization technology which multiplexes the server resources and utilizes the server in maximum level. Though the virtualization technology is used by many cloud providers it is not efficient in worst case scenario. The worst-case scenario is when the cloud server is overloaded; resource need for an incoming task is insufficient in the cloud server. In this paper, we propose some algorithms and methodologies to make the cloud efficient in a worst-case scenario.
