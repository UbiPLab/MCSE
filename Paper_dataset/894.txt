AB The monitoring of the computational processes in highly distributed environments remains challenging in today's High Performance Computing. In this paper, we define the agent-based cloud monitoring system for supporting the computational tasks scheduling and resource allocation. The system consists of two types of agents, which may decide about the initialization of the schedule execution and monitor the work of the cloud computational nodes. The decision about running the new scheduling process is based on the expected number of available computational units in the specified time window. The efficiency of the proposed MAS-based model was justified through 40 empirical tests, where clouds without and within the MAS support were compared. The multiagent system (MAS) effectiveness has been expressed in the average number of floating point operations completed at the cloud resources in one second. The obtained results show the importance of setting the optimal initial time for execution of the new schedule. Our experiments show that for running the new schedule, at least 25% of the computing units in the clouds should be in the idle mode. Also the batches of tasks should not be too large, cause the waiting time for new schedule for execution should be short and not greater than 10% of expected batch execution time.
