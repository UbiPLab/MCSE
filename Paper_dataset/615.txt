AB Recent advancements in the area of Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) have significantly contributed towards assisting mankind to handle varied types of emergency situations that may arise as a result of different natural calamities like earthquakes, floods, fire, etc, which may cause huge damage to public property and result in loss of wealth of the nation. In this work, we have proposed a mobile cloud assisted architecture that supports the multicloud and hybrid-cloud environments, together with Cloud Probing Service (CPS) and Cloud Ranking Service (CRS). The proposed algorithm consumes data from the sensor nodes and offloads the data to the most suitable cloud. A three-layered architecture has been proposed, and the anchor points facilitate in the creation of the interface between the different layers. The simulation results indicate that the proposed mobile cloud assisted architecture for handling emergency situations (MAAS) approach performs better than the baseline algorithms.
