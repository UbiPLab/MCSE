AB In recent years there has been a dramatic proliferation of research on imperfect software debugging phenomena. Software debugging is a complex process and is affected by a variety of factors, including the environment, resources, personnel skills, and personnel psychologies. Therefore, the simple assumption that debugging is perfect is inconsistent with the actual software debugging process, wherein a new fault can be introduced when removing a fault. Furthermore, the fault introduction process is nonlinear, and the cumulative number of nonlinearly introduced faults increases over time. Thus, this paper proposes a nonlinear, NHPP imperfect software debugging model in consideration of the fact that fault introduction is a nonlinear process. The fitting and predictive power of the NHPP-based proposed model are validated through related experiments. Experimental results show that this model displays better fitting and predicting performance than the traditional NHPP-based perfect and imperfect software debugging models. S-confidence bounds are set to analyze the performance of the proposed model. This study also examines and discusses optimal software release-time policy comprehensively. In addition, this research on the nonlinear process of fault introduction is significant given the recent surge of studies on software intensive products, such as cloud computing and big data.
