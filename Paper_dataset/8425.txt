AB Named data networking (NDN) is a revolutionary approach to cater for modern and future Internet usage trends. The advancements in web services, social networks and cloud computing have shifted Internet utilization towards information delivery. Information-centric networking (ICN) enables content-awareness in the network layer and adopts name-based routing through the NDN architecture. Data delivery in NDN is receiver-driven pull-based and governed by requests (interests) sent out by the receiver. The ever-increasing share of high-volume media streams traversing the Internet due to the popularity and availability of video-streaming services can put a strain on network resources and lead to congestion. Since most congestion control techniques proposed for NDN are receiver-based and rely on the users to adjust their interest rates, a fairness scheme needs to be implemented at the intermediate network nodes to ensure that "rogue" users do not monopolize the available network resources. This paper proposes a fairness-based active queue management at network routers which performs per-flow interest rate shaping in order to ensure fair allocation of resources. Different congestion scenarios for both single path and multipath network topologies have been simulated to test the effectiveness of the proposed fairness scheme. Performance of the scheme is evaluated using Jain's fairness index as a fairness metric.
