AB Cloud computing has slowly but surely become the foremost service provider for information technology applications and platform delivery. However, Cloud issues continue to exist, like cyberattacks, slow last mile latency, and clouds lack client-centric and location-aware applications to process real time data for efficient and customized application delivery. As an alternative, Fog Computing has the potential to resolve these issues by extending the Cloud service provider's reach to the edge of the Cloud network model, right up to the Cloud service consumer. This enables a whole new state of applications and services which increases the security, enhances the cloud experience and keeps the data close to the user. This research article presents a review on the academic literature research work on Fog Computing, introduces a novel taxonomy to classify cloud products based on Fog computing elements and then determine the best fit Fog Computing product to choose for the Cloud service consumer.
