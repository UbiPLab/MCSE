AB Facing the complex tasks involves making decisions about assignment of workloads to storage backends as well as dynamic and timely adjustment according to the storage demands in Cloud and Big-data environment, an administration tool for GlusterFS, WebGlusterFS, is presented in this article to ease the management and help to assign the storage resource. WebGlusterFS is a web-based tool designed to substitute the command line console manager of GlusterFS and provides an interface for auto-assignment module to build volumes from heterogeneous backend devices. A simple demo module is also implemented to show how various storage demands are fulfilled by building the volumes from properly matched storage resource with minimum cost. The characteristics of underlying storage resource are obtained by benchmarking and used to make the assignment decision. WebGlusterFS setups a base framework for workload aware storage platform for large scale computing environments.
