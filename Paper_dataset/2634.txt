AB The Internet of Things platform for environmental monitoring of the Lijiang River water, based on the representational state-transfer structure, is proposed in response to problems, such as an insufficient monitoring site, high complexity, and poor extendibility. The sensor node and node-state data were abstracted into resources, whose characteristics of concision, high efficiency, and loose coupling could satisfy the requirements of Lijiang River water-environment monitoring. The Alibaba cloud Elastic Compute Service server was adopted to establish the developmental environment for user management, GIS, real-time data display, and historical data inquiry with the help of a Laravel structure and a lightweight jQuery front-end framework. This platform could satisfy the requirements of fishery and animal industries, scientific research institutes, and governmental sectors, and enable the sharing of monitoring data on the Lijiang River water environment. According to the simulation results, the proposed technologies have not only realized remote data acquisition and transmission of water resource monitoring in real time with high reliability but also improved the economic efficiency of the entire network's energy loss.
