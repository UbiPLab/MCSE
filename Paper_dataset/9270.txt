AB A method for estimating the height of rice plants, using three-dimensional laser range data from point clouds, is proposed and assessed. Rice plant height (Eta) is estimated using a reference position at the top of the rice plant, avoiding the need to determine the ground position. Field experiments were performed with a SICK LMS 200 laser scanner in 2013 and 2014 on a test field with five different planting geometries. Percentile analysis identified the closest percentile to the top of the rice plant ( p(t) = 1), with vertical distances at the first percentile unaffected by planting geometry. The plant bottom position was identified using three different percentile ranks ( p(b) = 95, p(b) = 80, and p(b) = 70). Relative vertical distances (rD) were computed from the difference between the top and bottom positions of the rice plant. These correlated well with measured Eta, with slopes greater than 1.0. A greater number of stems in 2014 led to steeper slopes. Estimated Eta was more accurate when plant bottom positions were closer to the ground surface, and the best results were obtained with p(b) = 95 ( r(2) > 0.87; RMSE approximate to 4 cm). Overall, Eta was typically 16.0 cm greater than rD with p(b) = 95. (c) The Authors.
