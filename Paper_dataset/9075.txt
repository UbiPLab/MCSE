ID REMOTE USER AUTHENTICATION; KEY AGREEMENT SCHEME
AB Mobile cloud computing (MCC) has revolutionized the way in which the services can be obtained from the cloud service providers. Manifold increase in the number of mobile devices and subscribers in MCC has further enhanced the need of an efficient and robust authentication solution. Earlier, the subscribers could get cloud-computing services from the cloud service providers only after having consulted the trusted third party. Recently, Tsai and Lo has proposed a multi-server authenticated key agreement solution for MCC based on bilinear pairing, to eliminate the trusted third party for mutual authentication. The scheme has been novel as far as the minimization of trusted party involvement in authenticating the user and service provider, is concerned. However, the Tsai and Lo scheme has been found vulnerable to server spoofing attack (misrepresentation attack), de-synchronization attack and denial-of-service attack, which renders the scheme unsuitable for practical deployment in different wireless mobile access networks. Therefore, we have proposed an improved model based on bilinear pairing, countering the identified threats posed to Tsai and Lo scheme. Besides, the proposed work also demonstrates performance evaluation and formal security analysis.
