AB Discrete Fourier transform (DFT), inverse DFT (IDFT), and circular convolution are important tools for analyzing and designing discrete signals and systems, and are widely used in various industries. In order to pursue faster operational efficiencies or more accurate operational results, engineering calculations are often required to be quick and easy. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the local computational overhead required to perform DFT, IDFT, and circular convolution. In addition to improving the algorithms themselves, cloud computing outsourcing is also an optional method. In this paper, in response to the new challenges brought by cloud computing outsourcing, we design and propose an efficient and secure cloud computing outsourcing protocol for DFT, IDFT, and circular convolution. Through a theoretical explanation and simulation experiment, we show the efficiency, security, and verifiability of the proposed protocol.
