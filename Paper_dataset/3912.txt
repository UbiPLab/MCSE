AB Nowadays, with the rapid development and wide application of Internet of Things technology, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has become an essential part of industrial systems. A large number of IoT devices has enabled the diversification and decentralization of energy systems, and the Energy Internet makes it possible to interconnect distributed energy sources and consumers. However, as the number of entities involved in the energy transactions grows and the forms of transactions diversify, the traditional centralized energy trading model faces the problems such as insufficient scalability, vulnerabilities to cyber-attack, and low processing efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose BC-ETS, a secure and efficient BlockChain based Energy Trading Scheme. In BC-ETS, the energy trading model is divided into two levels, which can not only protect privacy but also achieve the balance between power supply and demand. Additionally, to adapt to the relatively weak computing power of the underlying IoT equipment in energy internet, a credibility-based equity proof mechanism is designed to greatly improve the system availability. The analysis shows that BC-ETS can meet the security requirements and has a better performance compared with other similar energy trading schemes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
