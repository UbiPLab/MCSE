AB The mobile fog computing-assisted resource allocation (RA) is studied for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) two-hop orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) networks, where a decode-and-forward (DF) relay first harvests energy from signals emitted by a source and then helps the source to forward information to its destination by using the harvested energy. Power splitting (PS) strategy is adopted at the relay and a different PS (DPS) receiver architecture is proposed, where the PS factors of all subcarriers are different. A RA problem is formulated to maximize the system's achievable rate by jointly optimizing subcarrier pairing, power allocation, and PS factors. Since the RA problem is a nonconvex problem and is difficult to solve, an efficient RA algorithm is designed. As the wireless channels are fast time-varying, the computation is performed in mobile fog node close to end nodes, instead of remote clouds. Results demonstrate that the achievable rate is significantly increased by using the proposed RA algorithm. It is also found that the computation complexity of RA algorithm of DPS receiver architecture is much lower than the existing identical PS (IPS) receiver architecture, and thus the proposed DPS architecture is more suitable for computation-constrained fog system.
