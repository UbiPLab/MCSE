ID ALLOCATION
AB With the advancement of information technology need to perform computing tasks everywhere and all the time there, in cloud computing environments and heterogeneous users have access to different sources with different characteristics that these resources are geographically in different areas. Due to this, the allocation of resources in cloud computing comes to the main issue is considered a major challenge to achieve high performance. Due to the nature of cloud computing is a distributed system to account, comes to business, economic methods such as auctions are used to allocate resources for decentralization. As an important economic bilateral hybrid auction model is the perfect solution for the allocation of resources in cloud computing, on the other hand, providers of cloud resources similarly, their sources of supply combined addressing. One of the problems auction two-way combination with maximum benefit for the parties to the transaction is the efficient allocation of resources to the problem of determining an auction winner is known. Given that the winning auction is NP-Hard. It results in a problem, several methods have been proposed to solve it. In this dissertation, taking into account the strength simulated annealing algorithm, a modified version of it is proposed for solving the winner determination in combinatorial double auction problem in cloud computing. The proposed approach is simulated along with genetic and simulated annealing algorithms and the results show that the proposed approach finds better solutions than the two mentioned algorithms.
