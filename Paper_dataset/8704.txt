AB Cloud computing has formed the conceptual an infrastructural basis for tomorrows computing. It is well-known that cloud computing has many enterprise applications potential advantages and data are emigrating to public or hybrid cloud. Cloud Computing has been e visualized as the next-generation architecture of IT Enterprise. Users can use cloud storage to store the data and get the data on-demand quality applications and services provide by different computing resources. TPA is a third party auditor used for checking the data integrity. Its doesn't bother to the storage of data and maintaining the data. To certainly introduce an effective TPA, the auditing processes under process should not bring new to system. The integrity of data is checked by the doing the public auditing. For this the third party auditor (TPA) is used. This process relives all burden from the cloud user. In this paper, the secure cloud system is built which supports security of the user data. This can be happen by integrating the Homomorphic linear authenticator and MAC-protocol. After this we performs audits for the many number of users simultaneously and more accurately, this will give the highly accurate and secured cloud model.
