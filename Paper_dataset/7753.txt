ID PERFORMANCE
AB Web services are now increasingly being hosted on public cloud infrastructure as a service platforms such as the Amazon Web service elastic compute cloud (EC2). However, previous studies have shown that the virtualized infrastructure used in public clouds can introduce contention among virtual machines (VMs) for shared physical host resources eventually leading to performance problems. Subscribers in a public cloud platform typically do not have access to metrics that can directly quantify the adverse impact of such inter-VM interference on Web service response times. We present a software probe based system to address this limitation. The probe is a lightweight application that runs on each Web service VM that needs to be monitored. We periodically measure the probe's response time on a monitored VM. We then compare this response time with the probe's previously recorded baseline no-interference response time when it executes in isolation on a VM of the same type. Statistically significant increase in the probe's response time from the baseline is used to detect interference. The probe also indicates the type of contention at the physical host that causes the interference. This information can be exploited by a subscriber to mitigate the problem. Results show that our approach is quite effective over two different cloud platforms and a wide variety of workload scenarios. In particular, results indicate that Web service instances hosted on EC2 suffer from interference. Our probe was able to detect 93% of performance degradations triggered by such interference. In all these cases, the probe imposed an average overhead of only 3%-4% on the mean response time of the Web service being monitored.
