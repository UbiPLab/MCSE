AB The growth in the data volume and number of evidential data from heterogeneous distributed systems in smart cities, such as cloud and fog computing systems and Internet-of-Things devices (e.g. IP-based CCTVs), has led to increased collection, processing and analysis times, potentially resulting in vulnerable persons (e.g. victims of terrorism incidents) being at risk. A process of Digital Forensic Data Reduction of source multimedia and forensic images has provided a method to reduce the collection time and volume of data. In this paper, a methodology of Digital Forensic Quick Analysis is outlined, which describes a method to review Digital Forensic Data Reduction subsets to pinpoint relevant evidence and intelligence from heterogeneous distributed systems in a timely manner. Applying the proposed methodology to real-world data from an Australian police agency highlighted the timeliness of the process, resulting in significant improvements in processing times in comparison with processing a full forensic image. The Quick Analysis methodology, combined with Digital Forensic Data Reduction, has potential to locate evidence and intelligence in a timely manner. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
