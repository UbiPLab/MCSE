AB In computer networks, the routing protocols play the main role in source to destination delivery of packets with minimum communication time between the nodes as well as in selecting the best paths while utilizing fewer resources. The design of an efficient routing protocol almost in any kind of network is an important issue specifically in the Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs). Recently, the network research community has been very active towards efficient routing over MANETs in order to provide high-performance network services. MANET is a collection of autonomous and infrastructure less wireless mobile nodes that communicate with each other by dynamically forming a multi-hop radio network. The highly dynamic and frequent changes in topology within MANETs raise many issues in the performance of routing protocols. So choosing an efficient routing protocol in MANETs is a challenging task. This study evaluates the performance of some of the well-known routing protocols that benefit the network function virtualization (NFV) in the cloud computing environment. The protocols used are AODV, DSDV, OLSR and GPSR. The proposed scenarios for the simulation of the routing protocols include a varying number of moving nodes. In the investigations of up to 50 nodes, the OLSR outperforms AODV, DSDV and GPSR.
