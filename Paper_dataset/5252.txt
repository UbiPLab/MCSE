AB Cloud computing is the latest in distributed computing technology. The delivery mechanism between the service provider and users depends on Service Level Agreement (SLA). SLA contains Quality of Service (QoS), which has some constraints such as deadline to achieve user satisfaction. In this article, the authors propose a Deadline-Aware Priority Scheduling (DAPS) model to minimize the average makespan, and maximize resource utilization under deadline constraint. In the proposed model, the tasks are sorted based on length priority in ascending order and labeling the VM's state as successful which achieves the deadline constraint, and then mapping the tasks to the suitable VM that has minimum processing time. The authors compared their proposed model to the existing algorithms GA, Min-Min, SJF and Round Robin. The proposed model outperforms other algorithms by reducing the average of makespan, mean of total average response time, number of violations, violation ratio, and failure ratio, while increasing resource utilization, and guarantee ratio for tasks that meet deadline constraint.
