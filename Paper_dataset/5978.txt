AB Wireless networks such as mobile networks, with their inflexible and expensive network infrastructure, are facing various challenges in efficiently handling the exponentially growing traffic demands of users. Hence, mobile network operators (MNOs) are looking forward to novel networking paradigms which could simplify the task of network management and control and allow faster deployment of newer solutions on top of existing hardware by software updates. Software defined networking (SDN) is a revolutionary technology which makes networks more agile and flexible by separation of data plane and control plane tasks. SDN is playing a key role in deploying mobile network services on network function virtualization (NFV) infrastructure for elastic and flexible deployment of core network services e.g., virtualization of evolved packet core in LTE to efficiently handle huge control signal overhead and traffic demands from machine-to-machine and internet of things devices. Besides, NFV and SDN are offering scalable, flexible and adaptable network service chaining platforms as a replacement for inflexible middleboxes. Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a new evolving platform which brings together IT services and cloud computing for offering end-users network aware services and solutions. In this survey, we enumerate numerous issues and challenges in designing SDN based wireless networks and review various SDN based seminal solutions for 4G/5G. Finally, this survey presents the role of SDN, NFV and MEC in designing 5G networks.
