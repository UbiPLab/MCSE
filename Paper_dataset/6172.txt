AB Software Development Community is moving towards adopting cloud due to the innumerous benefits of this computing paradigm. Cloud applications are architecturally required to be service oriented and therefore the software development process for developing cloud applications possess certain attributes to fully realize the potential of this computing and be aligned with the service dominant perspective. The purpose of this study is to identify, analyze and investigate the attributes of software development process for cloud application development to formulate a relational model. We used interpretive structural modeling approach to establish contextual relationship amongst the identified attributes and proposed a hierarchical structural model. The attributes are classified on the basis of their driving and dependence power through Impact Matrix Cross reference Multiplication applied to Classification. From the results, we observe that imbibing lean software development principles and model driven development emerge as strong driving attributes for cloud application development process.
