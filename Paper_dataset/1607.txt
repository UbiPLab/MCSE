AB The scattering properties of nonspherical particles can be approximately computed by equivalent spherical theory. The scattering properties of ice particles were approximately computed by Rayleigh approximation because the sizes of the ice particles are smaller than the wavelength of millimeter wave radar. Based on the above assumption, the echo fluctuation of moving particles was analyzed by computing the total backscattering field of a cirrus cloud using the classical vector potential technique. The simulation results showed that echo fluctuation influences the accuracy of retrieving the physical parameters of a cloud. To suppress the echo fluctuation of moving ice particles, a video integrator of a millimeter wave cloud radar would be used. However, video integrators lose the rapidly changing information of ice particles and reduce radar range resolution; thus, we propose the pace-diversity technique of MIMO radar to reduce the echo fluctuation, which could be validated by theoretical computation and experimental measurements.
