AB Aim: Having serious complications and high morbidity and mortality rate, stroke, which can result from ischemic and haemorrhagic causes, is a significant emergency case that requires early diagnosis and treatment. The aim of this study is to identify whether their is a significant relationship between mean value of platelet volume obtained from complete blood cell count of the patients diagnosed with haemorrhagic stroke, corpuscular distribution volume value and bleeding volume value identified in the computed tomography scans of the head.
   Material and method: The sample of the study consisted of all patients aged above 18 and diagnosed with haemorrhagic stroke who applied to Emergency Unit at Adana Numune Education and Research Hospital between 1, June 2014 and 30, July 2016.
   Results: The sample included 86 patients with haemorrhagic stroke. The sample consisted of 58 % (n=50) male and 41,9 % (n=36) female. The mean value for the patients' ages was 60,4 +/- 16,5. Among the patients, 60,5 % (n=52) of them were observed to have applied to the emergency service with sudden clouding of consciousness. A high majority of patients these (79,5 %) were later exitus. The mean value of red cells distribution volume of the patients with exitus was significantly higher than those of surviving patients' (p<0,05). Parenchymal bleeding was observed to exist in 55,8 % (n=48) of the patients. The mortality rate for the patients with high bleeding volume was higher.
   Conclusion: Impaired consciousness, existence of hypertension, high corpuscular distribution and bleeding volume can be among the factors affecting mortality.
