AB We investigate a workflow scheduling problem with stochastic task arrival times and fuzzy task processing times and due dates. The problem is common in many real-time and workflow-based applications, where tasks with fixed stage number and linearly dependency are executed on scalable cloud resources with multiple price options. The challenges lie in proposing effective, stable, and robust algorithms under stochastic and fuzzy tasks. A triangle fuzzy number-based model is formulated. Two metrics are explored: the cost and the degree of satisfaction. An iterated heuristic framework is proposed to periodically schedule tasks, which consists of a task collection and a fuzzy task scheduling phases. Two task collection strategies are presented and two task prioritization strategies are employed. In order to achieve a high satisfaction degree, deadline constraints are defined at both job and task levels. By designing delicate experiments and applying sophisticated statistical techniques, experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more effective and robust than the two existing methods.
