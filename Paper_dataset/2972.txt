AB This paper focuses on an integrated workload scheduling and pre-fetching model in a multimedia mobile cloud computing environment to enhance the performance of response time and reduce the cost to process multimedia data. The response time and cost optimization problems are presented along with the computation resources such as virtual machines (VMs) allocation, workload conservation, queueing stability constraints, and to overcome the total response time and cost, a heuristic approach of workload scheduling method is proposed. The integrated workload scheduling at pre-fetcher and cloud are considered to study the effects of various parameters such as VM's processing speed, pre-fetcher's utilization, the user requests arrival rate. The performance analysis results reveal that the cost and transmission speed are directly relevant factors, meaning that, once the rate of data transmission is increasing, the cost is also increasing and vice versa. Hence, the time and cost efficient workload scheduling is essential to satisfy both delay and cost in pre-fetcher enabled multimedia cloud systems.
