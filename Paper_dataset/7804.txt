AB Outsourcing computation is one of the most important applications in cloud computing, and it has a huge ability to satisfy the demand of data centers. Modular exponentiation computation, broadly used in the cryptographic protocols, has been recognized as one of the most time-consuming calculation operations in cryptosystems. Previously, modular exponentiations can be securely outsourced by using two untrusted cloud servers. In this paper, we present two practical and secure outsourcing modular exponentiations schemes that support only one untrusted cloud server. Explicitly, we make the base and the index blind by putting them into a matrix before send to the cloud server. Our schemes provide better performance in higher efficiency and flexible checkability which support single cloud server. Additionally, there exists another advantage of our schemes that the schemes are proved to be secure and effective without any cryptographic assumptions.
