AB Monitoring harmful algal blooms (HABs) in freshwater over regional scales has been implemented through mapping chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations using multi-sensor satellite remote sensing data. Cloud-free satellite measurements and a sufficient number of matched-up ground samples are critical for constructing a predictive model for Chl-a concentration. This paper presents a methodological framework for automatically pairing surface reflectance values from multi-sensor satellite observations with ground water quality samples in time and space to form match-up points, using the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform. A support vector machine model was then trained using the match-up points, and the prediction accuracy of the model was evaluated and compared with traditional image processing results. This research demonstrates that the integration of multi-sensor satellite observations through Google Earth Engine enables accurate and fast Chl-a prediction at a large regional scale over multiple years. The challenges and limitations of using and calibrating multi-sensor satellite image data and current and potential solutions are discussed.
