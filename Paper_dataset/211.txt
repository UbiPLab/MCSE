AB The urgent requirement of the sustainable computing determines that many security assurance protocols are designed with low computational cost. The design of the sustainable cloud storage auditing protocol is an attractive research filed in the security community. As we all know, secret keys of the data storage auditing in the cloud system are very sensitive. To enhance the security of the cloud data storage auditing, some studies focused on the research of key updates. In this paper, we propose a secure sustainable storage auditing protocol that can support key updates for clients in cloud computing. In order to alleviate the high overhead of key updates at the local side, the partial key update tasks are outsourced to the TPA. Moreover, clients can verify the validity of the new updated keys by using the technology of the BLS signature. The security analysis shows that the proposed protocol can provide the security properties of the correctness, the verifiability and the accountability. Compared to previous studies, the proposed protocol is more efficient which is very suitable for the real-world sustainable cloud storage auditing. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
