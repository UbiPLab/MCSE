AB Microservice is a new architecture that is getting attention in the development of service systems. However, microservice is still at the early stage and the acceptance of this architecture is overwhelming. Microservice architecture is a promising architecture in delivering loosely coupled, decentralized, and scalable system that utilizes the latest technology, such as container and cloud computing. However, the traditional method for analyzing and designing system will not be able to fully utilize the capability of the microservice architecture. Therefore, a new method for analyzing and designing the microservice holistically is being proposed in this paper. The Design Science Research methodology has been adopted in designing the proposed method. The artifact, which is the result of the research, is the proposed method. The proposed method has shown its potential in being used to analyze and design the microservice holistically and to benefit from the microservice architecture capabilities.
