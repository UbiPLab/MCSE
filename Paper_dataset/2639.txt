AB The systematic security practice training is of great significance to the training of information security personnel. In this paper, the design and implementation of a cloud based system security experiment platform are studied. First of all, on the basis of the system security experiment platform, this paper constructs the system security detection algorithm and analyzes the selection strategy of the computing scale. Secondly, the author explains the implementation steps of the algorithm, and finally the algorithm is tested. The results are analyzed from three aspects: entropy value feature, active entropy algorithm and cloud platform performance. The conclusion is obtained that: the algorithm designed in this paper has good accuracy and adaptability, and it can play a good supporting role in system safety practice training.
