AB Interconnectivity of smart devices such as mobile technology adoption in healthcare holds humongous impacts. Yet, medical professionals are reluctant to reap potential benefits of technology and the reason behind this phenomenon is ambiguous. This study aims to highlight current critical conditions in public healthcare hospitals in Pakistan, and how IoT will add value in healthcare services effectiveness through mobile computing and also to indicate current concepts that may add value in over-all smart healthcare system. According to available information, study to on AI enabled M-IoT network-based healthcare system specially in developing countries to address healthcare problems are rarely known. This study empirically analyzed the factors that influence IoT based smart healthcare devices adoption in Pakistan. In understand the phenomenon, Partial Least Square Equation Model (PLS SEM) was used to understand the relational influence of performance expectance, effort expectance, and social influence over behavior to use through intention to use the technology supported by Unified Theory of Acceptance Technology (UTAUT) assumptions. The results show that clinicians are reluctant to use technology though the results also reveal that same clinicians have positive influence of performance and effort expectations on their intention to use technology that leads the actual behavior of using the technology. Though, this research is among few to beacon upon urgent focus of public healthcare management in developing countries. Yet, new research is lacking far behind to facilitate methods to opt for M-IoT healthcare devices powered by AI.
