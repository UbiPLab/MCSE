AB One of the significant challenges for cloud providers is how to manage resources wisely and how to form a viable service level agreement (SLA) with consumers to avoid any violation or penalties. Some consumers make an agreement for a fixed amount of resources, these being the required resources that are needed to execute its business. Consumers may need additional resources on top of these fixed resources, known as-marginal resourcesthat are only consumed and paid for in case of an increase in business demand. In such contracts, both parties agree on a pricing model in which a consumer pays upfront only for the fixed resources and pays for the marginal resources when they are used. A marginal resource allocation is a challenge for service provider particularly small- to medium-sized service providers as it can affect the usage of their resources and consequently their profits. This paper proposes a novel marginal resource allocation decision support model to assist cloud providers to manage the cloud SLAs before its execution, covering all possible scenarios, including whether a consumer is new or not, and whether the consumer requests the same or different marginal resources. The model relies on the capabilities of the user-based collaborative filtering method with an enhanced top-k nearest neighbor algorithm and a fuzzy logic system to make a decision. The proposed framework assists cloud providers manage their resources in an optimal way and avoid violations or penalties. Finally, the performance of the proposed model is shown through a cloud scenario which demonstrates that our proposed approach can assists cloud providers to manage their resources wisely to avoid violations.
