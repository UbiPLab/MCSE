AB As autonomous and connected vehicles are becoming a reality, mobile-edge computing (MEC) off-loading provides a promising paradigm to trade off between the long latency of clouding computing and the high cost of upgrading the on-board computers of vehicles. However, due to the randomness of task arrivals, vehicles always have a tendency to choose MEC server for offloading in a selfish way, which is not satisfactory for the social good of the whole system and even results in a failure possibility of some tasks due to the overflow of MEC servers. This paper elaborates the modeling of task arrival process and the influence of various offloading modes on computation cost. Interestingly, by formulating task arrivals as a compound process of vehicle arrivals and task generations, we found that the task arrival model for MEC servers does not belong to the standard Poisson distribution, which contradicts the popular assumption in most existing studies. Considering the load distribution and the prediction of cost, we propose a load-aware MEC offloading method, in which each vehicle makes MEC server selection based on the predicted cost with the updated knowledge on load distribution of MEC servers. Analysis and simulation show that the proposed scheme can achieve up to 65% reduction of total cost with almost 100% task success ratio.
