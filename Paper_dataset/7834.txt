DE CLB; Load balance; Cloud computing
AB Cloud services are widely used in manufacturing, logistics, digital applications, and document processing. Cloud services must be able to handle tens of thousands of concurrent requests and to enable servers to seamlessly provide the amount of load balancing capacity required to respond to incoming application traffic in addition to allowing users to obtain information quickly and accurately. In the past, researchers have proposed the use of static load balancing or server response times to evaluate load balancing capacity, a lack of which may cause a server to load unevenly. In this study, a dynamic annexed balance method is used to solve this problem. Cloud load balancing (CLB) takes into consideration both server processing power and computer loading, thus making it less likely that a server will be unable to handle excessive computational requirements. Finally, two algorithms in CLB are also addressed with experiments to prove the proposed approach is innovative. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
