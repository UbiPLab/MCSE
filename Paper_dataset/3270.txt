AB Maximizing the number of virtual infrastructures spawned out of a data center is a prime concern of cloud service providers to improve their revenue and the customers' quality-of-experience. Optimal placement of topology sensitive virtual data centers on its physical counterparts increases the resource utilization and thereby the revenue. However, provisioning, scaling, and de-provisioning of virtual data centers, over the time, leaves the cloud data center fragmented. Embedding new virtual data centers on a fragmented data center would require migration of virtual machines and virtual network, already mapped to it. However, these migrations are costly in terms of the resource usage and possible violations of the terms of service level agreement. The costs of these migrations associated with a new embedding should be controlled to increase the profit. In this paper, the problem of finding virtual machine migrations with minimum cost is formally defined and two meta-heuristic solutions are proposed for it. We consider the memory size, the rate of page dirtying, the class of application running on the VM, and the bandwidth of the migration path for modeling the cost of migration. The objective is to find a pattern of virtual machine migrations so that the total cost for embedding a new virtual data center is minimized. Experimental results show that the proposed technique can reduce the average migration time upto 30% and the penalty for corresponding service level agreement violation by 200%.
