AB Cloud computing provides elastic data storage and processing services. Although existing research has proposed preferred search on the plaintext files and encrypted search, no method has been proposed that integrates the two techniques to efficiently conduct preferred and privacy-preserving search over large datasets in the cloud.
   In this paper, we propose a scheme for preferred search over encrypted data (PSED) that can take users' search preferences into the search over encrypted data. In the search process, we ensure the confidentiality of not only keywords but also quantified preferences associated with them. PSED constructs its encrypted search index using Lagrange coefficients and employs secure inner-product calculation for both search and relevance measurement. The dynamic and scalable property of cloud computing is also considered in PSED. A series of experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme when deploying it in real-world scenarios.
