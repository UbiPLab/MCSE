ID ENCRYPTION
AB This paper discusses a secure document sharing approach, which addresses confidentiality, integrity and authenticity concerns related to cloud-based data sharing. This research is focused on a secure construct that would integrate with other cloud ready standards and products for data protection. Sticky policies, recently considered as one of the preferred cloud data protection techniques, are here combined with standardized OOXML data package. The defined model leverages the Identity Based Encryption (IBE) scheme to attach sticky policies to the data. This paper also shows several security features and functions that are suitable for secure data sharing in the cloud. Technologies used for proposed construction are not new, therefore only their unique combination with AES key derived from XACML sticky policy via IBE and OOXML wrapper constitutes novelty of this research.
