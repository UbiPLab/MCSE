AB Because of the dynamic and scalable nature of multi-tenant Cloud platforms, which are becoming more and more complex, it is not easy to assess the system performance or to pick up the best configuration just based on human experience. In this work, we elaborated a framework using stochastic modeling instead of exhaustive experiments to assess the system performance. Moreover, The framework uses dynamic programming (here, we use value iteration algorithm) as a resource management and planning tool. In such complex systems, picking up the best system configuration is a challenge, for this reason we designed a heuristic algorithm that finds a treads-off between the tenants' budgets and the overall system performance. As a use case scenario of this framework, we addressed the problem of routing security requests, coming from the Cloud tenants, between different execution agents. The simulation results have demonstrated the benefit of using our framework in terms of identifying the optimal routing policy of security requests and improving system configuration.
