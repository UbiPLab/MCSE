   Cryptography
AB Graphs could be used in many several applications and in many different domains such as online games, social networks, computer networks and worldwide web. The massive use of graph data such as cloud computing services raises data confidentiality and privacy concerns, and data (especially the out of physically controlled one) should be encrypted using a highly secure and efficient encryption algorithm which may hinder data utilization and computation. in order to protect and hide data, Encryption used to convert the readable data into unreadable form, especially when the data transferred through transmission mediums. Encryption categorized into two main types: Symmetric and Asymmetric. This is an extension of previous work on text cryptography. This extension includes further discussions and detailed example.
