ID COMBINATORIAL AUCTION
AB Complexity and severity of DDoS attacks is increasing day by day. Internet has highly inconsistent structure in terms of resource distribution. Numerous technical solutions are present in this domain but solutions considering economic aspects have not been given attention. Therefore, in this paper, a multi attribute based auction mechanism to mitigate DDoS attacks has been proposed. A reputation based detection mechanism has been proposed where reputation of a user is assessed through his marginal utility. Along with detection mechanism, two payment mechanisms have been proposed for legitimate and malicious users separately. A greedy resource allocation is devised to allocate resources fairly among the legitimate users. Malicious users who manipulate their bid to acquire maximum share of limited resources are charged with penalty according to differential payment scheme. Since, this is a generalized concept to mitigate DDoS attacks on any platform, we have taken our case study on cloud computing. So, simulations have been carried out on CloudSim. Results obtained from simulations clearly showed that proposed approach performs better than existing DDoS attack mitigation techniques. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
