AB With the development of the Internet, the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has also been promoted. The IoT is a network of "objects and objects connected." The IoT is based on cloud computing platforms and wireless networks. It acquires data based on sensor groups and conducts decision analysis to change the behavior control and feedback of objects, such as the greenhouse monitoring system studied in this paper. The IoT has subverted the traditional agricultural production model, from the agricultural farming model to the "smart agriculture" production-operation-sales model, which provides a direction for the sustainable development of agriculture in China at this stage. Based on the IoT and Zig Bee wireless sensor network technology, this paper designs a general scheme of an intelligent greenhouse control system based on IoT technology. The greenhouse control strategy was studied using IoT technology and fuzzy adaptive PID control algorithm. The experimental simulation was carried out with MATLAB software. The simulation results show that the optimal control of greenhouse temperature is achieved. The temperature in the greenhouse is always maintained at 16.5 degrees C -23.0 degrees C, and the humidity value is always maintained at 68.2% RH-89.3% RH. The test verified that the paper can achieve the expected effect for the greenhouse.
