AB Cloud computing is the budding paradigm nowadays in the world of computer. It provides a variety of services for the users through the Internet and is highly cost-efficient and flexible. Data storage in the cloud is showing great attention. However, despite of all its advantages, security and privacy has evolved to be of significant apprehension in cloud computing and is discouraging factor for potential adopters. Online computing is preferred by consumers and businesses only if their data are assured to remain private and secure. Hence focus is to discover techniques in the direction of offering more confidentiality. Homomorphic encryption is one such technique. This paper aims to study several key concepts of cloud computing, namely, characteristics, delivery models, deployment models and cloud computing platforms. The paper includes the security challenges/issues in cloud computing. The paper also discusses the work done on cloud security and privacy issues and Homomorphic encryption. The paper explains the details and results related to different parameters of Homomorphic properties of some cryptosystems.
