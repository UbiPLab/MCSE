AB Cloud computing is a one of the network-based computing that provides services to computer and other cloud devices. Secure cloud data storage is a significant when using the cloud services provided by the service provider in cloud environment. Many research works have been developed to provide secure wireless communication in cloud. However, integrity verification of stored data on cloud was not addressed in an efficient manner. In order to overcome above limitations, bloom hashing based Schnorr signature (BH-SS) technique is proposed. In BH-SS technique, at first, the cloud users send the request to cloud server and it response the user requested data. Next, bloom hash function is used to increase the integrity of cloud data storage. Bloom hash function is an efficient data structure used for storing the data and its hashed value. Bloom hash function stores the various cloud user data in it bits of array by generating hash value for each cloud data. Each data has the diverse hash value in bit array. This helps for BH-SS technique to improve the data integrity and dynamic data storage in cloud environment. Lastly, BH-SS technique employed Schnorr signature to ensure confidentiality of stored data with the aid of producing private signing key and public verification key. Therefore, proposed BH-SS technique improves the data integrity rate and reduces execution time. The BH-SS technique conducts experimental works on the parameters such as data integrity, space complexity, execution time and data confidentiality rate. The experimental results observe that the BH-SS technique is able to enhance the cloud data integrity and also reduces the execution time of cloud storage and space complexity when compared to state-of-the-art-works.
