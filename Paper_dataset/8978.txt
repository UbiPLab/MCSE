AB Nowadays, railway infrastructure designers rely heavily on computer simulators and expert systems to model, analyze and evaluate potential deployments prior to their installation. This paper presents the railway power consumption simulator model (RPCS), a cloud-based model for the design, simulation and evaluation of railway electric infrastructures. This model integrates the parameters of an infrastructure within a search engine that generates and evaluates a set of simulations to achieve optimal designs, according to a given set of objectives and restrictions. The knowledge of the domain is represented as an ontology that translates the elements in the infrastructure into an electric circuit, which is simulated to obtain a wide range of electric metrics. In order to support the execution of thousands of scenarios in a scalable, efficient and fault-tolerant manner, this paper introduces an architecture to deploy the model in a cloud environment, and a dimensioning model to find the types and number of instances that maximize performance while minimizing the externalization costs. The resulting model is applied to a particular case study, allowing the execution of over one thousand concurrent experiments in a virtual cluster on the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud.
