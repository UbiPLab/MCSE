AB Cloud-based wireless networking system applies centralized resource pooling to improve operation efficiency. Fog-based wireless networking system reduces latency by placing processing units in the network edge. Confluence of fog and cloud design paradigms in 5G radio access network will better support diverse applications. In this article, we describe the recent advances in fog radio access network (F-RAN) research, hybrid fog-cloud architecture, and system design issues. Furthermore, the GPP platform facilitates the confluence of computational and communications processing. Through observations from GPP platform testbed experiments and simulations, we discuss the opportunities of integrating the GPP platform with F-RAN architecture.
