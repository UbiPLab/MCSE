AB With the development of the Internet of Things, the types and quantity of Internet of Things devices are increasing rapidly, and the amount of data collected is even more difficult to count. Digital marine multi-source data transmission involves a wide range of technologies, many application fields, complex levels and large amount of data, which is a huge system engineering. Data is the center of information application for various offshore multi-source transmission data. The traditional data storage system has been unable to adapt to the changes of multi-source data transmission at sea under the Internet of Things environment. According to the changing characteristics of massive data, combined with the advantages of cloud storage system, the marginal storage of offshore multi-source transmission data is carried out to provide users with real-time and efficient concurrent access services. Based on this, this paper will make a detailed analysis on the classification and storage methods of marine multi-source transmission data under cloud computing, so as to provide effective support for related research.
