AB With the development of wireless cloud computing, video caching in the radio access network (RAN) of cellular networks has attracted extensive attention due to its lower delay and higher resource utilization efficiency. Nevertheless, existing video cache management mostly made decisions only according to the video coding requirements, without considering users' individual requirements for the video service and without making full use of the abundant network-side information in real time or from statistics. In this paper, we propose a new QoE (quality of experience)-driven video cache management scheme with the consideration of the parameters from three parties (i.e. client, base station, and RAN cache server) for video provisioning, with statistics of video popularities and under limited cache capacity. Specifically, through experiments we establish the mapping relationship between the QoE value and the three key parameters (i.e. the request rate from the client, the bandwidth of air interface, and the response rate of the cache server). Firstly, we allocate different gross caches for different video clips according to their popularities. Secondly, we optimize the cache space allocation for each individual video clip based on the QoE mapping relationship and the different models of the request rate and the bandwidth, with the convex optimization method and the Lagrange multiplier solution. The experiments results indicate that the proposed video cache scheme has better QoE performance under the constraints of the total cache capacity, specific distributions of the request rate and the bandwidth.
