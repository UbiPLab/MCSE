ID ALGORITHM; SCHEME
AB The existence of Internet of Things (IoT) facilitates the collection and transmission of urban data information. However, it can leak users' personal privacy information in smart cities. Therefore, we propose a new private information encryption method in IoT under cloud computing environment. Under IoT, according to the properties and acquisition time, privacy information can be divided into many subspaces. Then, we analyze the private information encryption with different levels. Based on the stream cipher mechanism, we design an encryption system model of information collection. In the subspace, the privacy information is encrypted and transferred to the relay node. After encrypting, they are segmented and restructured. The long privacy information is divided into smaller slices. Then, they are reintegrated after conversion. Finally, we use stream cipher and dual-key algorithm to complete freedom nondestructive transformation between plaintext and ciphertext to ensure the integrity of the encrypted private information. Experimental results show that the proposed method takes less time in the encryption and decryption process, which has better ciphertext conversion output effect and suffers fewer network attacks in the same encryption time. The message encryption and decryption time is less than that of other methods. In terms of calculation cost, the proposed method decreases by approximately 14%. What is more, it has higher security and improves the security and integrity of the privacy information collection process.
