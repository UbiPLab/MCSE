AB In recent years, a large number of intelligent sensing devices have been deployed in the physical world, which brings great difficulties to the existing entity search. With the increase of the number of intelligent sensing devices, the accuracy of the search system in querying the entities to match the user's request is reduced, and the delay of entity search is increased. We use the mobile edge technology to alleviate this problem by processing user requests on the edge side and propose a similar physical entity matching strategy for the mobile edge search. First, the raw data collected by the sensor is lightly weighted and expressed to reduce the storage overhead of the observed data. Furthermore, a physical entity matching degree estimation method is proposed, in which the similarity between the sensor and the given sensor in the network is estimated, and the matching search of the user request is performed according to the similarity. Simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the data storage overhead and improve the precision of the sensor search system.
