AB The paper is dedicated to factors influencing users' adoption of sustainable cloud computing solutions. The article covers the important characteristics related to cloud computing. It also discusses how sustainable cloud computing is important for sustainability. The current state of their security and potential threats waiting for users is reviewed. The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of perceived usefulness, security, availability, and satisfaction on users' adoption of sustainable cloud computing solutions. The study tested and used the adapted Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) model in the context of cloud computing solutions. The partial least square method of structural equation modeling is employed to test the proposed research model. The study utilizes an online survey to obtain data from 252 cloud computing solutions users. The data set was analyzed using SmartPLS 3 software. Results showed that the best predictor of users' perceived usefulness and system & service quality is perceived availability, followed by perceived security. Both perceived usefulness and system & service quality predict users' attitude and intention to use of cloud computing solutions. The findings improve understanding regarding the adoption of cloud computing solutions, and this work is, therefore, of particular interest to the IT departments and cloud computing vendors.
