AB With the progress of information technology and the prevalence of smartphones, an opportunity to improve the children health services has been arisen. In this regard, many applications have been developed, most of which are not comprehensive enough to meet all of the needs in taking care of children. In this paper, a context-aware infant growth and nutrition monitoring system is proposed, designed, and developed under a pediatrician's supervision, considering the latest medical references. The system targets healthy infants and helps parents to keep their infants healthy. The proposed system has the growth and nutrition monitoring, health monitoring, and doctor intervention functionalities. It is designed using the Attribute-Driven Design method and consists of parent, doctor and cloud tiers. The parent and doctor tiers are implemented by Android on smartphones. The Software Architecture Analysis Method is used to evaluate the proposed system architecture. Finally, it is compared with other related systems. According to the comparison results, the proposed system provides more comprehensive and extensive features and capabilities, which meet the needs in taking care of children.
