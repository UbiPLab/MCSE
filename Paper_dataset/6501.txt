AB The article aims to establish relationships and classifications between attributes of the Lunardi, Frio and Brum (2011) model on the main Green IT practices adopted by organizations. For this descriptive work, document analysis and content analysis were used with the support of NVivo software, which involved multiple sources of data collection with the use of internal and external websites, surveys, public documents and interviews conducted in the digital media for 15 cases identified by their Green IT practices. As a result, we have observed features in the adoption of sustainable measures in some organizations regarding responsibilities for the use of new emerging technologies, including cloud computing, datacenter and virtualization that incorporate social and environmental aspects. The companies surveyed have demonstrated to an "Advanced" and "Moderate" stage that Green IT initiatives and practices contribute to the sustainability of their business, since many of them are included in different activities in the market as observed in the analyzed cases.
