AB Cloud computing is too often seen as a tactical way to reduce costs, when its most important benefit is as a strategic way to grow revenues. Such revenue growth can come about in a variety of ways, such as through faster innovation of new products, processes, and customer interactions; identifying more customers and closing more purchases; and improving customer relationships through more targeted offers and better service and experiences. Companies that clearly understand the relative magnitude of cost savings and revenue growth and orient themselves toward the latter will better exploit the cloud and related technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things, and blockchain, and thus strengthen their competitive advantage and customer value.
