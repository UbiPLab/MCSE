ID SECURITY
AB With the widespread popularity of cloud storage, cloud storage security issues have also received much attention. A provable data possession (PDP) scheme can effectively help users to verify the integrity of data stored remotely in the cloud. For this reason, the client's PDP scheme is constantly improving and developing. A non-repudiable dynamic PDP scheme based on the Stern-Brocot tree (Stern-Brocot-based non-repudiation dynamic provable data possession, abbreviated as SB-NR-DPDP) is proposed in view of the problem that the existing PDP scheme pays less attention to the clients deceiving the cloud server. We put forward a dynamic storage structure and dynamic operation algorithm based on the Stern-Brocot tree so that it can satisfy the client's dynamic data operations and realize the non-repudiation feature of the scheme. This scheme provides tag-unforgeability and proof-unforgeability against adaptive chosen-message attacks. The scheme can also resist hash value attacks, delete-insert attacks, and tamper with cloud return value attacks. The theoretical analysis shows that the proposed scheme has less computing overhead and storage overhead. As such, it has better safety and efficiency than other schemes.
