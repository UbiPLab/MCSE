ID RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT
AB The cloud operating system (cloud OS) is used for managing the cloud resources such that they can be used effectively and efficiently. And also it is the duty of cloud OS to provide convenient interface for users and applications. However, these two goals are often conflicting because convenient abstraction usually needs more computing resources. Thus, the cloud OS has its own characteristics of resource management and task scheduling for supporting various kinds of cloud applications. The evolution of cloud OS is in fact driven by these two often conflicting goals and finding the right tradeoff between them makes each phase of the evolution happen. In this paper, we have investigated the ways of cloud OS evolution from three different aspects: enabling technology evolution, OS architecture evolution and cloud ecosystem evolution. We show that finding the appropriate APIs (application programming interfaces) is critical for the next phase of cloud OS evolution. Convenient interfaces need to be provided without scarifying efficiency when APIs are chosen. We present an API-driven cloud OS practice, showing the great capability of APIs for developing a better cloud OS and helping build and run the cloud ecosystem healthily.
