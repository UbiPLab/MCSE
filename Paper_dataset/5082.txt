AB Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) is one of the most common threats that is growing in size and frequency in cloud computing environments due to its significant features. The good capacities of software-defined networking (SDN) (e.g. traffic examination based on software, centralized control and dynamic network reconfiguration) offer us new opportunities to defeat DDoS attacks in cloud environments. Although SDN brings numerous benefits while separating the control and data planes, it has important vulnerabilities that can be exploited by DDOS attacks. In this paper, we study how to defense SYN Flooding attacks at the switch level, so this latter will prevent and mitigate traffic anomalies without any switch-controller communication. To address this challenge, we propose a SYN flooding dynamic defensive mechanism which exploits the capabilities of SDN data plane using the programming language P4. The proposed approach activates the data plane with customized statistical information databases, traffic anomaly detection algorithm and SYN cookie techniques. These extensions enable the switch to prevent flow rate anomalies, realize the existence of SYN flooding attacks and then deploy adaptive countermeasures. Our system takes advantage of the switch programmability (i.e., using P4 language), distributed packet processing, and centralized SDN control, to offer an active defense mechanism against SYN flood attacks in cloud environments.
