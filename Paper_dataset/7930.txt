AB Cloud computing has emerged as a very flexible service paradigm by allowing users to require virtual machine (VM) resources on-demand and allowing cloud service providers (CSPs) to provide VM resources via a pay-as-you-go model. This paper addresses the CSP's problem of efficiently allocating VM resources to physical machines (PMs) with the aim of minimizing the energy consumption. Traditional energy-aware VM allocations either allocate VMs to PMs in a centralized manner or implement VM migrations for energy reduction without considering the migration cost in cloud computing systems. We address these two issues by introducing a decentralized multiagent (MA)based VM allocation approach. The proposed MA works by first dispatching a cooperative agent to each PM to assist the PM in managing VM resources. Then, an auction- based VM allocation mechanism is designed for these agents to decide the allocations of VMs to PMs. Moreover, to tackle system dynamics and avoid incurring prohibitive VM migration overhead, a local negotiation-based VM consolidation mechanism is devised for the agents to exchange their assigned VMs for energy cost saving. We evaluate the efficiency of the MA approach by using both static and dynamic simulations. The static experimental results demonstrate that the MA can incur acceptable computation time to reduce system energy cost compared with traditional bin packing and genetic algorithm-based centralized approaches. In the dynamic setting, the energy cost of the MA is similar to that of benchmark global-based VM consolidation approaches, but the MA largely reduces the migration cost.
