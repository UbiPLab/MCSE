AB Cloud computing platforms are usually based on virtual machines as the underlying architecture; the security of virtual machine systems is the core of cloud computing security. This paper presents an immune-based intrusion detection model in virtual machines of cloud computing environment, denoted as IB-IDS, to ensure the safety of user-level applications in client virtual machines. In the model, system call sequences and their parameters of processes are used, and environment information in the client virtual machines is extracted. Then the model simulates immune responses to ensure the state of user-level programs, which can detect attacks on the dynamic runtime of applications and has high real-time performance. There are five modules in the model: antigen presenting module, signal acquisition module, immune response module, signal measurement module, and information monitoring module, which are distributed into different levels of virtual machine environment. Performance analysis and experimental results show that the model brings a small performance overhead for the virtualmachine system and has a good detection performance. It is applicable to judge the state of user-level application in guest virtual machine, and it is feasible to use it to increase the user-level security in software services of cloud computing platform.
