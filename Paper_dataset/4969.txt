AB Present days' cloud computing has become successful computer paradigm because of "pay-as-you-go" model. Various solutions were proposed for handling cloud vulnerabilities and threats but most of which concentrate on single cloud environment which faces many problems like malevolent system administrator, service failure, loss of data integrity and data intrusion problem which can be reduced by moving towards multiple cloud environment. This paper mainly focuses on techniques for reliable secured storage in Multi-cloud environment by securely deploying chunks of data in multiple clouds where adversary will never get complete data at one place.
