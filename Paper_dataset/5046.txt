ID FULLY HOMOMORPHIC ENCRYPTION
AB With the advance of database-as-a-service (DaaS) and cloud computing, increasinglymore data owners are motivated to outsource their data to cloud database for great convenience and economic savings. Many encryption schemes have been proposed to process SQL queries over encrypted data in the database. In order to obtain the desired data, the SQL queries contain some statements to describe the requirement, e.g., arithmetic and comparison operators (+, -, x, <, >, and =). However, to support different operators (+, -, x, <, >, and =) in SQL queries over encrypted data, multiple encryption schemes need to be combined and adjusted to work together. Moreover, repeated encryptions will reduce the efficiency of execution. This paper presents a practical and secure homomorphic order-preserving encryption (FHOPE) scheme, which allows cloud server to perform complex SQL queries that contain different operators (such as addition, multiplication, order comparison, and equality checks) over encrypted data without repeated encryption. These operators are data interoperable, so they can be combined to formulate complex SQL queries. We conduct security analysis and efficiency evaluation of the proposed scheme FHOPE. The experiment results show that, compared with the existing approaches, the FHOPE scheme incurs less overhead on computation and communication. It is suitable for large batch complex SQL queries over encrypted data in cloud environment.
