DE Cloud Computing; Load Balance; Traffic Management
AB Cloud Computing (CC) is all about carrying out processing in other's system. There are various vendors who provide CC services. The basic algorithm that should be met to access CC services is a need for steady internet connection. As everything is done online the traffic across the internet is to be managed efficiently so that the transmission delay can be minimized and better quality of service can be given to the customers. The network should not be too congested at any moment of time. Hence the traffic management becomes a crucial factor for the better performance of the CC network. This paper addressed the most valuable terms and topics concerning the load balance/traffic management in cloud computing. Also, the paper is meant to discuss the study analysis of the recent researches in load balance of CC. From the study analysis the current research gap is addressed with a future scope of research to overcome the research gap.
