AB The tension force pre-stressing of most pre-stressed concrete beams (BPS) for high-speed railways in China is currently performed using a traditional manual operation method, leading to low efficiency, poor precision, a complicated operation, and uncontrollable calibration authenticity, among other factors. This paper presents an intelligent tension control and management system for a BPS, including the hardware equipment and corresponding matching software system. In accordance with the current scenario in pre-stressed tension construction, intelligent tensioning control station, tensioning jacks, and other hardware equipment, matching BPS software has been developed. This system is based on radio frequency identification technology, cloud technology, big data technology, the building of a set platform regarding the pre-stressed tension construction control, process management, supervision, and implementation of a railway precast beam. The system achieves automation, information, visualization and remote of the entire process of pre-stressed tension construction, and lays the foundation for the popularization of the Internet of Things technology within railways in China.
