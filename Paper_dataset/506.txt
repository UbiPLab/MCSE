AB With the popularity of cloud computing and IoT, consistently increasing data brings us a great burden to store locally. Due to the local limited storage capacity and expensive maintenance cost, individuals and enterprises are preferred to outsource their data to the public commercial cloud (e.g., Google Drive and Dropbox). However, the commercial cloud can not be fully trusted because data on the cloud may be modified by various reasons (e.g., outside hackers' attacks, hardware or software failures). To ensure data integrity, one of the most popular techniques is secure cloud storage (SCS). Nevertheless, traditional solutions of SCS with heavy cryptographic operations make data outsourcing computationally complicated. Moreover, most proposed approaches only focus on verifying data integrity while neglecting the functionality of data dynamics. To address these issues, we propose a Secure Auditable Cloud Storage (SecACS) scheme supporting data dynamics. SecACS requires less computation time by employing lightweight cryptographic operations. Compared to the previous solutions, the extensive experimental results demonstrate that SecACS achieves one order of magnitude faster in outsourcing data and twice faster in checking data integrity.
