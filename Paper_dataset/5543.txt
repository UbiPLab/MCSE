AB Virtual worlds have become global platforms connecting millions of people and containing various technologies. For example, No Man's Sky (nomanssky.com), a cross-platform virtual world, can dynamically and automatically generate content with the progress of user adventure. AltspaceVR (altvr.com) is a social virtual reality platform supporting motion capture through Microsoft's Kinect, eye tracking, and mixed reality extension. The changes in industrial investment, market revenue, user population, and consumption drive the evolution of virtual-world-related technologies (e.g., computing infrastructure and interaction devices), which turns into new design requirements and thus results in the requirement satisfaction problem in virtual world system architecture design. In this paper, we first study the new or evolving features of virtual worlds and emerging requirements of system development through market/industry trend analysis, including infrastructure mobility, content diversity, function interconnectivity, immersive environment, and intelligent agents. Based on the trend analysis, we propose a new design requirement space. We, then, discuss the requirement satisfaction of existing system architectures and highlight their limitations through a literature review. The feature-based requirement satisfaction comparison of existing system architectures sheds some light on the future virtual world system development to match the changing trends of the user market. At the end of this study, a new architecture from an ongoing research, called Virtual Net, is discussed, which can provide higher resource sufficiency, computing reliability, content persistency, and service credibility.
