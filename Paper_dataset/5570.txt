AB In order to improve the stability of mobile network system for application of the next generation of Internet of Things (IoT), balance the network load and guarantee the quality of user service experience, this article first introduces the computing migration framework for the network of the next generation, and summarizes the concept and content of mobile edge computing (MEC) using software-defined network (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV). And then, this article proceeds to introduce the MEC strategy based on SDN and NFV technology as well as multiattribute decision making, computing migration, multiattribute decision, the MEC decision model based on SDN and NFV technology and the solving process of the MEC decision model based on SDN and NFV. Finally, the three sets of simulation experiments based on MATLAB are designed to validate the multiattribute decision of MEC migration strategy based on SDN and NFV. The results show that the multiattribute decision making based on SDN and NFV can select the appropriate MEC center, further reduce the server response time and improve the quality of user service experience. This article is of great significance to the application of IoT terminal in the next generation of network environment.
