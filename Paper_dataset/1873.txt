AB Mobile edge computing is conceived as an appealing technology to enhance cloud computing capability of mobile devices (MDs) at the edge of the networks. Although some researchers use the technology to address the intensive tasks' high computation needs of MDs in small-cell networks (SCNs), most of them ignore considering the interests interaction between small cells and MDs. In this paper, we study a distributed computation offloading strategy for a multi-device and multi-server system based on orthogonal frequency-division multiple access in SCNs. First, to satisfy the interest requirements of different MDs and analyze the interactions among multiple small cells, we formulate a distributed overhead minimization problem, aiming at jointly optimizing energy consumption and latency of each MD. Second, to ensure the individuals of different MDs, we formulate the proposed overhead minimization problem as a strategy game. Then, we prove the strategy game is a potential game by the feat of potential game theory. Moreover, the potential game-based offloading algorithm is proposed to reach a Nash equilibrium. In addition, to guarantee the performance of the designed algorithm, we consider the lower bound of iteration times to derive the worst case performance guarantee. Finally, the simulation results corroborate that the proposed algorithm can effectively minimize the overhead of each MD compared with different other existing algorithms.
