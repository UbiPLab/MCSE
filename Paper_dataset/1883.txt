AB Cloud computing is a technology that allows the end-users to access the network through a shared area of resources. As the demand for the cloud computing increases, vulnerabilities in the service provision also increase. EDoS is one of the attacks that take over the provider, financially affecting the various organizations which use the cloud data. This paper utilizes fuzzy entropy and lion neural learner (FLNL) for the classification of cloud users to mitigate EDoS attacks in the cloud. This technique includes a training phase, which creates a log file using various parameters and then transforms the features into database considering certain key features. There are two important stages in this classification approach: feature selection and classification. Here, the fuzzy entropy function is utilized for feature selection which effectively selects useful features without information loss. The classification is performed using lion neural learner (LNL) which incorporates Lion algorithm (LA) into the neural network and uses Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm. The experimental results finalize that the proposed FLNL is effective with 89% precision, 78% recall, and 83.13% of f-measure compared with the existing Naive Bayes (NB), Neural Network+ Back Propagation (NN+ BP), and Neural Network + Levenberg-Marquardt (NN + LM).
