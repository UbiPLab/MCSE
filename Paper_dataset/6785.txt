AB The acceleration of technical change in the fast moving electronics market increases the uncertainty and risk for IT providers. Influenced by new IT provisioning concepts such as cloud computing, providers are looking to identify stable guidelines and success factors within existing and new business models. The authors have conducted an intensive analysis of the business model characteristics of 45 providers in the cloud market that are critical to success. A cloud business model framework with 105 characteristics was used to systemize the business models, and the data was analyzed statistically in regard to indicators for success. The results revealed 42 success-related business model characteristics, and a cluster analysis led to three common combinations of characteristics that describe meta types of cloud business models. The most promising meta type is a specialized cloud provider with customer-oriented branch solutions, while small-scale newcomers with aggregation services experience difficulties to be competitive. To evaluate and verify the results and the success of each business model type, 12 expert interviews were conducted. The interview statements were aggregated and summarized to offer recommendations for action and a prediction for the success of cloud business models.
