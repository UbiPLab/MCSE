AB One of the objective of cloud computing is to provide Resources as a Services to the client, in which resources are retrieved from cloud service provider efficiently and effectively over the Internet. To manage effectively the available resources of the cloud provider, resources use load balancing techniques to which has certain issues like load estimation, remote node selection, system stability, fault tolerance, performance indices, reduce cost of ownership, load level comparison, SLA violation etc. Accuracy can be implemented in form of efficient load balancing techniques. Dominant to this issue, it is necessary to develop optimal and efficient load balancing algorithms for various type of load, i.e. network load, CPU load, and Memory intensive applications. It also helps to avoiding a situation where some nodes are over loaded while others are idle or doing little work. The research carried out in this paper, the purpose of this research to improve response time by modeling behaviors of i) Progressive queue of node & ii) Request priority queue, which positively impact on optimization of resources as well as cost.
