AB In this study, an analytical hierarchy process based model is proposed to perform the decision-making for virtual machine migration towards green cloud computing. The virtual machine migration evaluation index system is established based on the process of constructing hierarchies for evaluation of virtual machine migration, and selection of task usage. A comparative judgment of two hierarchies has been conducted. In the experimental study, five-point rating scale has been adopted to map the raw data to the scaled rating score; this rating method is used to analyze the performance of each virtual machine and its task usage data. The results show a significant improvement in the decision-making process for the virtual machine migration. The deduced results are useful for the system administrators to migrate the exact virtual machine, and then switch on the power of physical machine that the migrated virtual machine resides on. Thus the proposed method contributes to the green cloud computing environment.
