AB As the concept of merging the capabilities of mobile devices and cloud computing is becoming increasingly popular, an important question arises: how to optimally schedule services/tasks between the device and the cloud. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the possibilities for using a decision module on mobile devices in order to autonomously optimize the execution of services within the framework of Mobile Cloud Computing while taking context into account. A novel model of the decision module with learning capabilities, service-oriented architecture, and service selection optimization algorithm are proposed to solve this problem. To achieve autonomous, online learning on mobile devices, we apply supervised learning. Information about the context, task description, the decision made and its results such as calculation time or power consumption are stored and form training data for a supervised learning algorithm, which updates the knowledge used by the decision module to determine the optimal place for the execution of a given type of task. To verify the solution proposed, service-oriented mobile processing systems for multimedia file conversion have been developed and series of experiments have been executed. Results show that the decision module has become more efficient in assigning the task to either the mobile device or cloud resources.
