AB Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a new promising technique to provide cloud-computing capabilities at the edge of cellular networks in close proximity to mobile users. In this paper, we consider joint optimization of the communication and computation resources in a multiuser, multiserver MEC system. The objective of this optimization problem is to minimize the total energy consumption of mobile devices under the time-sharing constraint. Given the fact that no coordination is involved between mobile devices, we propose a light-weight and decentralized algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs well in terms of convergence and outperforms the conventional centralized approach.
