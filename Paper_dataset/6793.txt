AB Fog computing is an architecture that extends the traditionally centralized functions of cloud computing to the edge and into close proximity to the things in an Internet of Things network. Fog computing brings many advantages, including enhanced performance, better efficiency, network bandwidth savings, improved security, and resiliency. This article discusses some of the more important architectural requirements for critical Internet of Things networks in the context of exemplary use cases, and how fog computing techniques can help fulfill them.
