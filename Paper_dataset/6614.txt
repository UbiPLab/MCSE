AB High energy consumption in data center has become a key problem, and the Carbon (CO2) emissions from data center have serious impacts on environment. To improve traditional performance-energy model and minimize energy consumption in cloud data center, an energy-efficient and QoS-aware (EEQoS) model is developed for virtual resources consolidation. The EEQoS model is designed to investigate the trade-off between energy and QoS. The user's satisfaction degree and Euclidean distance of resources are also respectively applied to the QoS model and power model. In addition, this EEQoS model is combined with the particle swarm optimization algorithm by setting the power consumption per QoS value as the objective function to consolidate virtual resources in data center. Compared with traditional power model, the proposed model reduces response time by 27.2%, cost by 31.4%, SLA violations by 40.5% and improves throughput by 13.5% on average while increasing less than 3.8% energy consumption during the whole test period.
