AB Forward radiative transfer models (RTM) are an indispensable tool for quantitative applications of satellite radiometers, e.g., for data calibration, instrument development, retrieval, and so on. In this study, we develop an accurate and efficient RTM for radiometers onboard Fengyun satellites, namely FYRTM (RTM for Fengyun Radiometers). Correlated k-distribution models are developed to improve the computational efficiency for gas absorption, and the effects of cloud and aerosol multiple scattering and emission are accelerated with pre-computed look-up tables. FYRTM is evaluated with a rigorous simulation based on discrete ordinate radiative transfer model (DISORT) as well as a popular fast forward model, i.e., the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM). Results indicate that FYRTM-based simulations are two to three orders of magnitudes faster than the DISORT-based simulations. Compared to the rigorous model, FYRTM relative errors are within 2% at solar channels, and brightness temperatures (BT) differences are within 1 K at infrared channels. Compared with CRTM, FYRTM is computationally similar at solar channels, but three times faster at infrared channels. Furthermore, simulated reflectances/BTs using FYRTM are in a good agreement with the satellite observations. Overall, FYRTM is capable to simulate satellite observations under different atmospheric conditions, and can be extended to other radiometers onboard the Fengyun satellites (both geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites). It is expected to play important roles in future applications with Fengyun observations.
