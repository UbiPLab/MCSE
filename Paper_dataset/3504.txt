AB VCC can bring many benefits to intelligent transportation systems. Meanwhile, HSR, an increasingly efficient means of transportation, faces several challenges in terms of high-frequency handover at speeds over 300 km/h. This includes large volumes of data of different types and different degrees of importance. Therefore, a secure and comprehensive cloud computing solution is attractive to improve the safety and efficiency of intelligent HSR. In this article, we present a novel and practical SVCC-HSR based on our long-term research and practice in this field. SVCC-HSR not only considers the various technical features of vehicular cloud computing, but also addresses several special demands in the HSR context. We perform extensive experiments using various scenarios, including frequent handover scenarios in high-speed trains running at 300 km/h with large-volume data transmission scenarios in locomotive depots. The real-world experimental results demonstrate that SVCC-HSR achieves better performance in fast authentication, hierarchical attribute-based data encryption, and transmission efficiency compared to its counterparts.
