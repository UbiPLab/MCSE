AB The uncertainty of demands brings challenges for the private cloud providers, leading to low utilization of resources during periods of low-demand and low quality of service during periods of peak-demand, which has attracted much attention. In this paper, taking account into both uncertainty of demands and budget constraint, we design an online sequential procurement auctions of residual resources, which helps the busy cloud provider make an irrevocable decision about how to purchase resources during period of uncertain peak-demand. The crucial part of the mechanism is the seller accepting-rule based on a value-density threshold which is learned dynamically from the historical information. Given the condition that all the sellers are myopic, we prove that the mechanism is truthful, budget feasible and individual rational. Furthermore, we obtain the competitive ratio of the proposed mechanism when the demands of the BCP are 3-degree balance. Using real data from parallel computing centers, we construct 60 scenarios in six data settings, in which we compare our mechanism with average budget allocation and offline proportional sharing mechanism, the results show that in more than 85% scenarios the proposed mechanism has better performance than allocation with average budget, and it improves more than 20% valuation on average for the buyer, even if we use the estimate value of balance degree 8.
