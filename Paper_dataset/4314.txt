AB The emergence of deep neural networks (DNNs) as a state-of-the-art machine learning technique has enabled a variety of artificial intelligence applications for image recognition, speech recognition and translation, drug discovery, and machine vision. These applications are backed by large DNN models running in serving mode on a cloud computing infrastructure to process client inputs such as images, speech segments, and text segments. Given the compute-intensive nature of large DNN models, a key challenge for DNN serving systems is to minimize the request response latencies. This paper characterizes the behavior of different parallelism techniques for supporting scalable and responsive serving systems for large DNNs. We identify and model two important properties of DNN workloads: 1) homogeneous request service demand and 2) interference among requests running concurrently due to cache/memory contention. These properties motivate the design of serving deep learning systems fast (SERF), a dynamic scheduling framework that is powered by an interference-aware queueing-based analytical model. To minimize response latency for DNN serving, SERF quickly identifies and switches to the optimal parallel configuration of the serving system by using both empirical and analytical methods. Our evaluation of SERF using several well-known benchmarks demonstrates its good latency prediction accuracy, its ability to correctly identify optimal parallel configurations for each benchmark, its ability to adapt to changing load conditions, and its efficiency advantage (by at least three orders of magnitude faster) over exhaustive profiling. We also demonstrate that SERF supports other scheduling objectives and can be extended to any general machine learning serving system with the similar parallelism properties as above.
