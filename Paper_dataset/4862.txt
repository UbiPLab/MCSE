AB Cloud computing is an information technology paradigm that enables ubiquitous access to shared pools of configurable system resources and higher level services required by modern technology. Task scheduling is an important part in cloud computing for limited number of heterogeneous resources and increasing number of user tasks. Task scheduling is to allocate tasks (cloudlets) to the best suitable resources to increase performance in terms of some parameters, such as makespan and resource utilization. Allocating cloudlets with good load balancing and minimum makespan is an NP-hard optimization problem. Many meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms have been proposed to solve the said problem, but they lack in considering the completion time of virtual machine and total length of its allocated cloudlets instead of only considering completion time of a cloudlet. This lack leads to decrease the performance of a cloud system in some cases, such as large cloudlets. To address the said problem, in this paper, we propose an optimal heuristic cloudlet allocation algorithm for resource allocation and task scheduling, referred as HCA, to cope with the increasing large number of user cloudlets under minimum resource capacity. So, we devise a new mechanism to combine optimal completion time and earliest finish time to minimize both degree of imbalance and overall completion time. The experimental results show that the proposed HCA can achieve effectively and efficiently good performance, best load balancing, and improve the resource utilization in comparison with the other existing cloudlet allocation methods.
