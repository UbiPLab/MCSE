AB Aiming at the diversity of user features, the uncertainty and the variation characteristics of quality of service (QoS), by exploiting the continuous monitoring data of cloud services, this paper proposes a multi valued collaborative approach to predict the unknown QoS values via time series analysis for potential users. In this approach, the multi-valued QoS evaluations consisting of single-value data and time series data from consumers are transformed into cloud models, and the differences between potential users and other consumers in every period are measured based on these cloud models. Against the deficiency of existing methods of similarity measurement between cloud models, this paper presents a new vector comparison method combining the orientation similarity and dimension similarity to improve the precision of similarity calculation. The fuzzy analytic hierarchy process method is used to help potential users determine the objective weight of every period, and the neighboring users are selected for the potential user according to their comprehensive similarities of QoS evaluations in multiple periods. By incorporating the multi-valued QoS evaluations with the objective weights among multiple periods, the predicted results can remain consistent with the periodic variations of QoS. Finally, the experiments based on a real-world dataset demonstrate that this approach can provide high accuracy of collaborative QoS prediction for multi-valued evaluations in the cloud computing paradigm.
