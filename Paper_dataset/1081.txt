AB In order to effectively solve the problem of data security in cloud computing, a hierarchical multi-authorization attribute-based encryption (HM-ABE) scheme is proposed. The authorization center of different privileges controls the different attributes and distributes the private key components. It greatly reduces the workload of a single authority. At the same time, it prevents joint attacks from illegal users. The standard security model is established to prove that the HM-ABE scheme reaches INA-CPA security. Through the experiment simulation, the performance is analyzed. The results show that the HMABE scheme implements a secure, efficient and flexible system access control. The flexibility of the attribute set is greatly improved. It adapts to more complex fine-grained access control.
