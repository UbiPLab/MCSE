AB Technological innovation is a vital method for enterprises to remain sustainably competitive. Highlighting the emerging information technology such as cloud computing, big data, and Internet of Things (IOT) provides grounds for options of technological innovation for service-orientated enterprises, how could the service-orientated enterprises make appropriate and effective decisions? This paper constructs the evaluation criteria system of a technological innovation scheme selection based on the four-dimensional model of service innovation and uses the hybrid multi-criteria decision model (MCDM) to make systematic selection. That is, to analyze the relationship between every dimension and criteria based on Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method, draw out the network diagram, calculate the weighted ratio of each indicator using the Analytic Network Process (ANP) method, and finally through integrating the modified VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (mVIKOR) method to order the enterprise innovation scheme. The result of this paper shows that Beacons technology is the best service innovation scheme, and the sequencing of each dimension's weight is the new service delivery system, new client interface, new service concept, and technology choice. It also, combining with the research conclusion, gives out advice on enterprises' technological innovation selection process.
