AB With the development of cloud computing, more and more users employ cloud-based Personal Health Record (PHR) systems. The PHR is correlated with patient privacy, thus existing research suggests to encrypt PHRs before outsourcing. Comparison-Based Encryption (CBE) realizes time comparison in attribute-based access policy, however, the time for encryption is linearly with the number of attributes in the access policy. Therefore, the cost of the scheme is extensive; besides, the scheme is difficult to revoke the user's access privileges in real time. To realize efficiently a fine-grained access control and user revocation for PHRs in clouds, a Fine-Grained access control with User Revocation (FGUR) scheme is proposed by incorporating Broadcast Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (BCP-ABE) and an attribute hierarchy into CBE. The experiment results show that the FGUR scheme has better performance in terms of the encryption cost and dynamic access privilege, compared with CBE.
