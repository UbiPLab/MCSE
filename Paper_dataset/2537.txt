AB Designing negotiator agents who adopt real-world inspired negotiation strategies in front of different types of negotiation scenario increases the chance of having better utility and success rate in negotiation-based cloud resource allocation. To realize real-world inspired multi-strategy based negotiating system for cloud marketplace, three following issues are focused in this paper: 1) Designing a new negotiation_strategy_basket with the aim of approaching the strategies of the real-world negotiation markets, 2) Modeling the critical condition of the cloud trading market, and 3) Adopting a new fuzzy decision system (i.e., Fuzzy Negotiation Strategy Selection System (FNSSDS)) for conducting negotiator agents of type resource providers and resource customers in how to select a suitable negotiation strategy from negotiation_strategy_basket according to the critical condition of the cloud trading market. We perform extensive simulation experiments to compare the performance of the proposed negotiator agents with the well known negotiator agents in name MDA (Market Driven Agent). The results show that the proposed negotiation agents outperform the MDAs.
