AB This paper presents the results of numerical simulation of Molecular Cloud-Cloud Collision in the under the head-on and glancing impacts. The calculations are performed according to different colliding scenarios between two dissimilar (by size, displacement and inner distribution of matter) spherical clouds. The aim is to study the matter compression in clumps and filaments formed, the generation of vortex coherent structures in new formations imbalanced after the collision and to analyze the influence of emergent instabilities on clouds morphing. In-house Eulerian code is used to perform a numerical experiment on high-performance computers. Nebula shaping and the compression oscillations in a shock core depend on initial impulse of colliding molecular clouds. The article gives a morphological analysis of gas redistribution by density under local compression in a bow-shock layer and filaments which are generated. The mechanism of perturbations to matter turbulization, fragmentation and disruption of new formations is revealed. Strong shock compression pulsations generated in the gas core and waved rarefactions in the interstellar medium are interpreted as possible Nonlinear Thin Shell Instability and Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability aftereffect.
