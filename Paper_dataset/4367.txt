AB The advantages of cloud computing encourage individuals and enterprises to outsource their local data storage and computation to cloud server, however, data security and privacy concerns seriously hinder the practicability of cloud storage. Although searchable encryption (SE) technique enables cloud server to provide fundamental encrypted data retrieval services for data-owners, equipping with a result verification mechanism is still of prime importance in practice as semi-trusted cloud server may return incorrect search results. Besides, single keyword search inevitably incurs many irrelevant results which result in waste of bandwidth and computation resources. In this paper, we are among the first to tackle the problems of data-owner updating and result verification simultaneously. To this end, we devise an efficient cryptographic primitive called as verifiable multi-keyword search over encrypted cloud data for dynamic data-owner scheme to protect both data confidentiality and integrity. Rigorous security analysis proves that our scheme is secure against keyword guessing attack (KGA) in standard model. As a further contribution, the empirical experiments over real-world dataset show that our scheme is efficient and feasible in practical applications.
