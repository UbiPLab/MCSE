AB Since the United States, the European Union, China, and other countries put forward the development strategy of Internet of Things (IoT), it has been growing rapidly, leading to industrial restructuring and the sustainable development of various industries. Not only can collaborative innovation of the IoT industry accelerate R&D efficiency and product substitution frequency of IoT infrastructure, but also it can promote the construction of smart cities, the application of Big Data and Cloud Computing, and the development of 5G. In China, government is a leader and initiator of IoT infrastructure deployment. Therefore, in this paper, we construct an evolutionary game model of the IoT industry under government leadership represented by government, telecom equipment manufacturers, and telecom operators. Then, we analyze the asymptotic stability, equilibrium stability, and evolutionary stability strategy of the model. Finally, we carry out numerical simulation to investigate the effect of eight factors and four mechanisms on evolutionary behaviors of the three parties. The results show each factor has a different influence on them. Evolutionary game model offers ideas for government and industry subjects before the collaborative innovation of IoT infrastructure deployment in practice.
