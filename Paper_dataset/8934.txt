AB The huge bandwidth and hardware capacity form a high combination together which leads to a vigorous development in the Internet. On the other hand, different problems will come up during the use of the networks such as delay and node tasks load. These problems lead to degrade the network performance and then affect network service for users. In cloud computing, users are looking to be provided with a high level of services from the service provider. In addition, cloud computing service facilitates the execution of complicated tasks that needed high-storage scale for the computation. In this paper, we have implemented a new technique to retain the service and assign tasks to the best and free available node already labeled by the manager node. The Cloud Computing Alarm (CCA) technique is working to provide all information about the services node and which one is ready to receive the task from users. According to the simulation results, the CCA technique is making good enhancements on the QoS which will increase the number of users to use the service. Additionally, the results showed that the CCA technique improved the services without any degrading of network performance by completing each task in less time.
