AB The newly emerged Software-Defined Systems (SDSs) promised to reduce computing systems management complexity. This can be achieved by separating the control plane from the data plane. On the other hand, cloud computing usage proliferation creates new challenges for managing user data efficiently. Such challenges include data ownership, data access policies, data privacy and integrity, and the availability of storage space. Using encryption-based solution is effective but very costly. Other solutions that used data classification based on the data priority can mitigate the high cost problem for data encryption. However, managing such data classification systems is very complex. In this paper, we are introducing a Software-Defined System-based solution for deploying efficient data classification framework. Our results show the superiority of the proposed model.
