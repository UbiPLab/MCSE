AB This paper proposes the grouped tasks scheduling (GTS) algorithm that is used to schedule tasks in cloud computing network by applying quality of service to satisfy user's needs. The proposed algorithm distributes tasks into five categories; each category has tasks with similar attributes (user type, task type, task size, and task latency). After adding tasks into right category, it starts scheduling these tasks into available services. Scheduling is done in two steps: first step is deciding which category will be scheduled first. This depends on the attributes of the tasks that belong to each category so the category that has tasks with high value of attributes will be scheduled first. Second step is deciding which task inside the chosen category will be scheduled first. This depends on the execution time of task so the task that has minimum execution time will be scheduled first.
