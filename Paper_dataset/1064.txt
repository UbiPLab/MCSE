AB Nowadays, communication devices, such as laptops, computers smart phones and personal media players, have extensively increased in popularity thanks to the rich set of cloud services to which they allow users to have access. This paper focuses on setting solutions of network latency for communication devices by the use of cloudlets. This work also proposes a conception of a local datacentre that allows users to connect to their data from any point and through any devices by the use of the Raspberry. We also display the performance demonstration results of the resource utilisation rate, the average execution time, the latency, the throughput and the lost packets that provide the big advantage of cloudless application from the local and distant connection. Furthermore, we display an evaluation of cloudless by comparing it to similar services and by setting simulation results through a CloudSim simulator.
