AB In order to solve the problems of multi-source heterogeneous, mass storage, and information sharing of traditional railway signal multi-information location data, based on the analysis of railway big data environment, the architecture of the cloud physics-based information physical fusion system (CPS) was proposed. The service division and hierarchical combination of the architecture were analyzed. Taking the railway signal multiple information train positioning data as an example, a real-time processing method of railway large data stream based on Storm was proposed. Finally, the cloud storage model designed in this paper was compared with the traditional stand-alone architecture. The results showed that this system had a greater advantage in handling large amounts of data. To sum up, the system has practical application value in the processing of multi-information location data of railway signals. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
