AB Complex market and society demands lead entrepreneurs to launch innovative knowledge-based firms, that change the way of life of many people. New models of business are taking advantage of the growth of the Internets and cloud computing, among so many technology-driven opportunities. In the academic circle, underlying these transformations, emerged the Service Dominant Logic (SDL), a marketing and management philosophy, fruit of the collaboration of teachers, researchers, consultants and professionals. Given the proliferation of sub-disciplines in Marketing, typical of a paradigm crisis, Vargo and Lusch (2004) proposed a structuring framework for Marketing theory, based on a elegant and parsimonious set of axioms, assumptions, and concepts. The SDL opened avenues of theoretical and methodological progress, with interesting practical implications. Going beyond, the LDS is the mainstay of the emerging Science of Service. In this orbit, this article exposes and reflects on the Science of Service and its surroundings. Presents reasons, nature and impacts of Science of Service. Synthesize the SDL. Explains the Internet of Things and the knowledge-based organizations. Shows the forefront of IBM on this journey. Highlights the relevance of this science to Brazil. Stimulates the practical adoption of these perspectives and the academic contribution to the development of them.
