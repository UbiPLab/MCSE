AB With the increasing number of IoT devices, fog computing has emerged, providing processing resources at the edge for the tremendous amount of sensed data and IoT computation. The advantage of the fog gets eliminated if it is not present near IoT devices. Fogs nowadays are pre-configured in specific locations with pre-defined services, which limit their diverse availabilities and dynamic service update. In this paper, we address the aforementioned problem by benefiting from the containerization and micro-service technologies to build our on-demand fog framework with the help of the volunteering devices. Our approach overcomes the current limitations by providing available fog devices with the ability to have services deployed on the fly. Volunteering devices form a resource capacity for building the fog computing infrastructure. Moreover, our framework leverages intelligent container placement scheme that produces efficient volunteers' selection and distribution of services. An Evolutionary Memetic Algorithm (MA) is elaborated to solve our multi-objective container placement optimization problem. Real life and simulated experiments demonstrate various improvements over existing approaches interpreted by the relevance and efficiency of (1) forming volunteering fog devices near users with maximum time availability and shortest distance, and (2) deploying services on the fly on selected fogs with improved QoS.
