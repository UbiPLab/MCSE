AB Cloud computing system consists of distributed resources in a dynamic and decentralized environment. Therefore, using cloud computing resources efficiently and getting the maximum profits are still challenging problems to the cloud service providers and cloud service users. It is important to provide the efficient scheduling. To schedule cloud resources, numerous heuristic algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithms have been adopted. The paper proposes a Modified Particle Swarm Optimization (MPSO) algorithm to solve the above mentioned issues. We first formulate an optimization problem and propose a Modified PSO optimization technique. The performance of MPSO was evaluated against PSO, and GA. Our experimental results show that the proposed MPSO minimizes the task execution time, and maximizes the resource utilization rate.
