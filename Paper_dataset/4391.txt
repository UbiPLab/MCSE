AB This paper presents a novel and efficient data transmission scheme based on mobile edge computing for the massive IoT environments which should support various type of services and devices. Based on an accurate and precise synchronization process, it maximizes data transmission throughput, and consistently maintains a flow's latency. To this end, the proposed efficient software defined data transmission scheme (ESD-DTS) configures and utilizes synchronization zones in accordance with the 4 usage cases, which are end node-to-end node (EN-EN), end node-to-cloud network (EN-CN), end node-to-Internet node (EN-IN), and edge node-to-core node (EdN-CN); and it transmit the data by the required service attributes, which are divided into 3 groups (low-end group, medium-end group, and high-end group). In addition, the ESD-DTS provides a specific data transmission method, which is operated by a buffer threshold value, for the low-end group, and it effectively accommodates massive IT devices. By doing this, the proposed scheme not only supports a high, medium, and low quality of service, but also is complied with various 5G usage scenarios. The essential difference between the previous and the proposed scheme is that the existing schemes are used to handle each packet only to provide high quality and bandwidth, whereas the proposed scheme introduces synchronization zones for various type of services to manage the efficiency of each service flow. Performance evaluations show that the proposed scheme outperforms the previous schemes in terms of throughput, control message overhead, and latency. Therefore, the proposed ESD-DTS is very suitable for upcoming 5G networks in a variety of massive IoT environments with supporting mobile edge computing (MEC).
