AB This paper presents F2C, a cooperative resource management system for Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) clouds. Inspired by group-buying mechanisms in real product and service markets, F2C advocates a group of cloud tenants (called tenant coalition) to buy resource capacity in bulk and share the resource pool in the form of virtual machines (VMs). Tenant coalitions leads to vast opportunities for fine-grained resource sharing among multiple tenants. However, resource sharing, especially for multiple resource types, poses several challenging problems in pay-as-you-use cloud environments, such as sharing incentive, free-riding, lying and economic fairness. To address those problems, we propose Reciprocal Resource Fairness (RRF), a novel resource allocation mechanism to enable fair sharing on multiple resource types within a tenant coalition. RRF is implemented in two complementary and hierarchical mechanisms: inter-tenant resource trading and intra-tenant weight adjustment. RRF satisfies several highly desirable properties to ensure fairness. We implement F2C in Xen platform. The experimental results show F2C is promising for both cloud providers and tenants. For cloud providers, F2C improves VM density and cloud providers' revenue by 2.2X compared to the current IaaS cloud models. For tenants, F2C improves application performance by 45 percent and guarantees 95 percent economic fairness among multiple tenants.
