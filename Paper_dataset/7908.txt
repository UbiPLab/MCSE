AB We explore and demonstrate the feasibility of implementing distributed solutions for advance reservation of network resources. We introduce a new distributed, distance-vector algorithm, called Distributed Advance Reservation (DAR), that provably returns the earliest time possible for setting up a connection between any two nodes. Our main findings are the following: (i) we prove that widest path routing and path switching (i.e, allowing a connection to switch between different paths) are necessary to guarantee earliest scheduling; (ii) we propose and analyze a novel approach for loop-free distributed widest path routing, leveraging the recently proposed DIV framework. Our routing results directly extend to on-demand and inter-domain QoS routing problems.
