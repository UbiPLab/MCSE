AB Since Fog computing is proposed to enable computing directly at the edge of the network, which can deliver new applications and services especially for the Internet of Things (IoT). In order to provide a high flexible and reliable platform of IoT, an IoT platform that combining Fog computing and Cloud computing is proposed in this study. In an IoT platform, the fault-tolerance is an important research topic. To cope with the influence from faulty components, reaching a common agreement at the presence of faults before performing some special tasks is essential. However, the previous protocols for the agreement problem of distributed computing are not enough for the IoT platform that combining Fog computing and Cloud computing. In this study, the agreement problem is revisited. The new proposed protocol can make all fault-free nodes reach agreement with minimal rounds of message exchanges and tolerate the maximal number of allowable faulty components in the IoT platform that combining Fog computing and Cloud computing.
