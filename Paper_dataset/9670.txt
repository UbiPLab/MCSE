   Re-encryption
AB With the increasing number of mobile applications and the popularity of cloud computing, the combination of these two techniques that named mobile cloud computing (MCC) attracts great attention in recent years. However, due to the risks associated with security and privacy, mobility security protection in MCC has become an important issue. In this paper, we propose an efficient traceable access control scheme with reliable key delegation named KD-TABE in MCC. Firstly, we present a traceable CP-ABE system and realize key delegation without loss of traceability. Secondly, a new type of re-encryption method is proposed, which is based on an intuitive method that supports any monotonic access tree instead of the re-encryption key. Lastly, to reduce trust on authority, we separate the authority into three parts, and each authority is responsible for generating different components of the key. The analysis shows that the proposed scheme can meet the security requirement of MCC. In addition, it cost less compared with the other popular models.
