AB Utility based cloud services can efficiently provide various supportive services to different service providers. Trust negotiations with federated identity management are vital for preserving privacy in open systems such as distributed collaborative systems. However, due to the large amounts of server based communications involved in trust negotiations scalability issues prove to be less cumbersome when offloaded on to the cloud as a utility service. In this view, we propose trust based federated identity management as a cloud based utility service. The main component of this model is the trust establishment between the cloud service provider and the identity providers. We propose novel trust metrics based on the potential vulnerability to be attacked, the available security enforcements and a novel cost metric based on policy dependencies to rank the cooperativeness of identity providers. Practical use of these trust metrics is demonstrated by analyses using simulated data sets, attack history data: published by MIT Lincoln laboratory, real-life attacks and vulnerabilities extracted from Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) repository and fuzzy rule based evaluations. The results of the evaluations imply the significance of the proposed trust model to support cloud based utility services to ensure reliable trust negotiations using federated identity management.
