AB With continued advancements of mobile computing and communications, emerging novel multimedia services and applications have attracted lots of attention and been developed for mobile users, such as mobile social network, mobile cloud medical treatment, mobile cloud game. However, because of limited resources on mobile terminals, it is of great challenge to improve the energy efficiency of multimedia services. In this paper, we propose a cloud-assisted green multimedia processing architecture (CGMP) based on mobile cloud computing. Specifically, the tasks of multimedia processing with energy-extensive consumption can be offloaded to the cloud, and the face recognition algorithm with improved principal component analysis and nearest neighbor classifier is realized on CGMP based cloud platform. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can effectively save the energy consumption of the equipment.
