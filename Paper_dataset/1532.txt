AB Cloud computing is a computing paradigm that provides a set of scalable resources on demand. Mobile clients/users and Internet of Things (IoT) are using cloud resources for their applications. However, it also is a target of cyber-attacks and creates risks for data privacy and protection. Identity management (IdM) has emerged as an important issue for reducing complexity and improving the user experience when accessing services. In addition, nowadays networks and/or security administrators added SAML to authentication services. These service options are available for different uses including a cloud subscriber. In this work, the SAML representation of existing identity management frameworks and its suitability are emphasized. We introduced a new representation of SAML that makes it lightweight, easier to use and easier to parse. This representation is demonstrated using JSON. In this new SAML representation, we enhanced the performance by marshaling the SAML by 28.99%. In this paper, we will go into these challenges to introduce a new representation for the identity and access management by using a markup language. Our results show that the proposed representation is suitable for small processing power devices for faster generation, parsing, and communication.
