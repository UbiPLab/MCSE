AB The mobile edge computing (MEC) technology can provide mobile users (MU) with high reliability and low time-delay computing and communication services. The imbalanced edge cloud deployment can better adapt to the non-uniform spatial-time distribution of tasks and reduce the deployment cost of edge cloud servers. For multi-user and multi-task offloading decision based on the imbalanced edge cloud, a new offloading cost criteria, based on the tradeoff among time delay-energy consumption-cost, is designed to quantify the user experience of task offloading and to be the optimization target of offloading decision. Both the optimization problems of minimizing the sum offloading costs for all MUs (efficiency-based) and minimizing the maximal offloading cost per MU (fairness-based) are discussed. Efficiency-based offloading decision algorithm [centralized greedy algorithm (CGA) and modified greedy algorithm (MGA)] and fairness-based offloading decision algorithm [fairness-based greedy algorithm (FGA)] are proposed, respectively, and the performance bounds of the algorithm are analyzed. The simulation results show that the offloading cost of the MGA is lower than the CGA, the efficiency of resource utilization of the CGA is higher than that of the FGA, and the fairness of the FGA is stronger than that of the CGA.
