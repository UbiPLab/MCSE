AB We proposed a crowd cloud routing protocol based on opportunistic computing to improve the data transmission efficiency, reliability, and reduce routing overhead in wireless sensor networks. Based on the analysis of the demand of big data processing in wireless sensor network, the data analysis and processing platform for wireless sensor network are designed based on the combination with the cloud computing. The cloud platform includes the main nodes, the nodes, and the core nodes. There are the engine and the drive between the wireless sensor network and the cloud server. Secondly, aiming at the problem of data transmission in the cloud platform, we design an opportunistic computing model which is suitable for wireless sensor networks to minimize the weight of routing management and network overhead. Then, we design an opportunistic calculation model to guarantee the data transmission scheme of the cloud platform. Finally, by eliminating the factors that may cause the link instability, the crowd cloud routing protocol is proposed. The experimental results show that the proposed crowd cloud routing protocol has the functions of real-time and reliability and reduces the cost of routing request.
