AB Collecting sensor data through wireless Internet protocol with cloud computing is a new IT architecture and many applications are adopting similar framework of Internet of Things based on it. For sensor devices, cloud environment can be applied to reduce their computing resource limitations to store, index and process their data. Besides, there are several concerns on communication between them in terms of security and privacy issues. In this paper, we focus on paid user authentication methods for the communication in Korea. System managers' survey on their preferences based on given criteria shows overall priority of security investment. Survey results show system experts have diverse opinions on paid authentication methods based on convenience, security level and operational cost. To review the current challenges of paid authentication method, we scrutinize recent survey results on authentication methods in terms of Internet of Everything framework. Also we compare the well-defined data security requirements in Internet services with current devices to check its compatibility to protect personal data from the security perspective.
