AB With the continuous development of computer software and hardware technology, three-dimensional graphics rendering technology has gradually become one of the main research contents of computer graphics. It plays a great role in virtual reality, digital city, film and television advertising, computer aided design and scientific computing visualization. The computer simulation of natural phenomena is the key technology in the rendering of three-dimensional graphics. Natural scenery has the characteristics of complex form, random change and so on. It is difficult to express and study with a definite mathematical model. Compared with natural phenomena such as fire, cloud, mountain and rain, underwater scenes are more challenging because of their complex motion rules and optical characteristics. Therefore, this study analyzedthe research status in China and abroad, improved and innovated the underwater scene rendering technology and large-scale underwater scene management technology based on the research of underwater scene grid algorithm, which completedthe large-scale underwater real-time rendering and the optimization algorithm of underwater scene management for underwater scene geometry modeling. The simulation experiment is used to detect the rendering effect, the experimental structure proves that the method has strong practicability and can effectively improve the accuracy and authenticity of underwater scene reduction.
