AB Cloud capability is considered to be extended to the edge of the Internet for improving the security of data transmission. Compressive sensing (CS) has been widely studied as a built-in privacy-preserving layer to provide some cryptographic features while sampling and compressing, including data confidentiality guarantees and data integrity guarantees. Unfortunately, most existing CS-based ciphers are too lightweight or highly complex to meet the requirements of both high security of transmitting the captured data over the Internet and low energy consumption of sensing devices in the Internet of Things (IoT). In this article, a secure transmission framework for CS data by combining CS-based cipher and edge computing is proposed. From the perspective of security, the double-layer encryption mechanism and double-layer authentication mechanism are rooted in it by performing some privacy-preserving operations, including CS-based encryption, CS-based hash, information splitting, strong encryption, and feature extraction. Most significantly, the proposed framework is very useful for resource-limited IoT applications.
