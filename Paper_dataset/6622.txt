AB With the inevitability and emergence of e-Government cloud around the world, there has been an increasing need for exploring the determinants and their mechanism of e-Government cloud adoption. In order to fill the existing knowledge gap, a grounded theory approach is adopted in this study for discussing the determinants of e-Government cloud adoption among government agencies in China. Choosing representative cases, we collect triangulate data and analysis the data using open coding, axial coding and selective coding. This study proposes a grounded theoretical model consists of sixteen sub-categories, five main categories and one core category (e-Government cloud adoption) and explore the factors' influence mechanism. The results show that technology driving, cloud provider support, environmental stimulus, organizational readiness and cloud trust play significant roles in e-Government cloud adoption. In addition, technology driving and cloud provider support indirectly effect e-Government cloud adoption by cloud trust. Environmental stimulus and organizational readiness moderate the relationship between cloud trust and cloud adoption. These findings contribute to academic research and practical implications, advancing our understandings of e-Government cloud applications.
