AB A phishing attack is one of the severe threats to the smartphone users. As per the recent lookout report, mobile phishing attack is increasing 85% year to year and going to become a significant threat to the smartphone users. This social engineering attack attempts to get the user's password by disguising as trusted service provider. Most of the smartphone users are using the Internet services outside of the traditional firewall. Cloud-based documents are one of the primary targets of this phishing attack in mobile cloud computing. Also, most smartphone users are using the cloud storage in their device. To secure against this password attack in a mobile cloud environment, we propose a new authentication scheme to provide novel security to the mobile cloud services. This scheme will verify the user and service provider without transmitting the password using the Zero-knowledge proof based authentication protocol. Moreover, the proposed scheme will provide mutual authentication between the communication entities. The effectiveness of proposed scheme would be verified using protocol verification tool called Scyther.
