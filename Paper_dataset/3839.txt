AB In this paper we present a novel on-line NFV (Network Function Virtualization) orchestration algorithm for edge computing infrastructure providers that operate in a heterogeneous cloud environment. The goal of our algorithm is to minimize the usage of computing resources which are offered by a public cloud provider (e.g., Amazon Web Services), while fulfilling the required networking related constraints (latency, bandwidth) of the services to be deployed. We propose a reference network architecture which acts as a test environment for the evaluation of our algorithm. During the measurements, we compare our results to the optimal solution provided by an ILP-based solver.
