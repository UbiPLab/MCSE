AB Transparent Computing (TC) is becoming a promising paradigm in network computing era. Although many researchers believe that TC model has a high requirement for the communication bandwidth, there is no research on the communication bandwidth boundary or resource allocation, which impedes the development of TC. This paper focuses on studying an efficient transparent computing resource allocation model in an economic view. First, under the quality of experiments (QoE) ensured, the utility function of clients and transparent computing providers (TCPs) is constructed. After that, the demand boundary of communication bandwidth is analyzed under the ideal transparent computing model. Based on the above analyses, a resource allocation scheme based on double-sided combinational auctions (DCA) is proposed so that the resource can be shared by both the service side and the client side with the welfare of the whole society being maximized. Afterward, the results scheduled in different experimental scenarios are given, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Overall, this work provides an effective resource allocation model for optimizing the performance of TC.
