AB Cloud computing delivers highly scalable and flexible computing and storage resources on pay-per-use policy. Cloud Computing's services for computation and storage are getting increasingly popular and many organizations are now moving their data from in-house data centers to the Cloud Storage Providers (CSPs). However, increasing user base and remote storage of data introduces challenges like inefficient usage of resources and insider threat to data at rest in the cloud storage. Time varying workload and data intensive applications are vulnerable to encounter such challenges while using cloud computing services. The consolidation of virtual machines to minimize the total number of active servers is a promising solution to conserve the energy but it requires efficient resource management strategies. Additionally, the encryption strategies and third party auditors to maintain data integrity are still in their developing stage and therefore the data at rest is still a concern for the cloud storage users. In this paper, we designed a distributed storage allocation architecture for fair utilization of storage resources and we also design an integrated end to end security framework for data at rest in cloud storage to eliminate insider threats.
