AB By using fog computing, cloud computing can be extended to the edge of the network. Generally, in the public cloud, fog computing comprises three components: terminal device, fog node and public cloud server (PCS). In this paper, we propose the concept of anonymous and secure aggregation scheme (ASAS) in fog-based public cloud computing. In the ASAS model, a fog node aggregates the data from terminal nodes and forwards the aggregated data to the public cloud server. By using the ASAS scheme, the fog node can help terminal devices upload their data to PCS. By using the data aggregation technique, our ASAS scheme can save bandwidth between the fog node and PCS. At the same time, our ASAS scheme not only protects the identities of terminal devices by using pseudonyms but it also guarantees data secrecy via a homomorphic encryption technique. In this paper, we design the first concrete ASAS scheme. We also examine the security and the performance of our proposal, which we show to be provably secure and efficient. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.
