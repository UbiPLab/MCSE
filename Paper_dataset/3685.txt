AB Storage as a service has become an important paradigm in cloud computing for its great flexibility and economic savings. However, the development is hampered by data privacy concerns: data owners no longer physically possess the storage of their data. In this work, we study the issue of privacy-preserving set-valued data publishing. Existing data privacy-preserving techniques (such as encryption, suppression, generalization) are not applicable in many real scenes, since they would incur large overhead for data query or high information loss. Motivated by this observation, we present a suite of new techniques that make privacy-aware set-valued data publishing feasible on hybrid cloud. On data publishing phase, we propose a data partition technique, named extended quasi-identifier-partitioning (EQI-partitioning), which disassociates record terms that participate in identifying combinations. This way the cloud server cannot associate with high probability a record with rare term combinations. We prove the privacy guarantee of our mechanism. On data querying phase, we adopt interactive differential privacy strategy to resist privacy breaches from statistical queries. We finally evaluate its performance using real-life data sets on our cloud test-bed. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the validity and practicality of the proposed scheme.
