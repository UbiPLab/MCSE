AB The use of resources has always been the focus of the study. Since that the tasks and data needed to be dealt with in cloud computing is enormous in amount, in order to better reasonably allocate cloud computing resources, scheduling tasks efficiently, and allowing the user to complete the target in a short time and with low cost, this paper presents a genetic algorithm based on the time and the cost. Through the analysis of four major factors, total task completion time, total cost and average task time and average cost, construct the corresponding fitness function. The improved algorithm can effectively solve the factors of time and cost for cloud computing. In the simulation experiments, by comparing with several other new improved cloud computing algorithms in recent years, this algorithm has higher scheduling efficiency.
