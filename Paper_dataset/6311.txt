AB The present research paper proposes and develops a Cloud computing based Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) Model named as CloudGanga for sharing, analysis and processing of geospatial data particularly in River Ganga Basin management in India. The main purpose of the CloudGanga is to integrate all the geospatial information such as dam location, well location, irrigation project, hydro power project, canal network and central Water Commission gauge stations locations related to River Ganga. CloudGanga can help the decision maker/planner or common users to get enough information for their further research and studies. The open source software (Quantum GIS) has been used for the development of geospatial database. QGIS Plugin has been linked with Quantum GIS for invoking cloud computing environment. It has also discussed about the various overlay analysis in CloudGanga environment. In the present research, machine learning approaches are also used in a R tool for well locations which are associated with the basin of River Ganga.
