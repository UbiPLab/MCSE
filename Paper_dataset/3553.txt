AB To fully realize future autonomous driving scenarios, Internet of Vehicles (lay) has attracted wide attention from both academia and industry. However, suitable cost and stable connectivity cannot be strongly guaranteed by existing architectures such as cellular networks, vehicular ad hoc networks, etc. With the prosperous development of artificial intelligence, cloud/edge computing and 5G network slicing, a more intelligent vehicular network is under deliberation. In this paper, an innovative paradigm called Cognitive Internet of Vehicles (CIoV) is proposed to help address the aforementioned challenge. Different from existing works, which mainly focus on communication technologies, CIoV enhances transportation safety and network security by mining effective information from both physical and network data space. We first present an overview of Cloy including its evolution, related technologies, and architecture. Then we highlight crucial cognitive design issues from three perspectives, namely, intra-vehicle network, inter-vehicle network and beyond-vehicle network. Simulations are then conducted to prove the effect of CIoV and finally some open issues will be further discussed. Our study explores this novel architecture of Cloy, as well as research opportunities in vehicular network.
