ID DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT
AB The last few years have witnessed a vast evolution in the communication and computational fields. The presence of social media makes data transferring more easier, which raises a flag of unauthorized usage and redistribution of digital contents. This copyright scenario is hardly affecting the publishing rights of authors and publishers. This paper presents a robust framework that protects the copyright property where only the authorized users legally use the data and prevents the illegal using or copying of data. The proposed framework is based on Digital Right Management (DRM) and includes two robust cryptosystems; Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithms. The multimedia contents are encrypted using the AES-256 algorithm, while the shared key is encrypted using the ECC algorithm. The authorized user can utilize the copyrighted contents if the authorization is not expired. The license generation is done by a lightweight data-interchange format JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), and the license is validated using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm. The evaluation of the system has shown that it is fulfilling all the requirements of DRM technology with low cost, availability, platform independently, reliability and scalability since it is implemented on a cloud platform.
