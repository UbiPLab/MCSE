AB The OpenNebula is an open source environment which provides cloud resources with the help of Haizea as a lease manager. The Haizea supports different types of leases from which deadline sensitive lease is one of them. In real time, most of the leases are deadline sensitive leases. These deadline sensitive leases are scheduled by using the backfilling algorithm. In the backfilling algorithm one of the lease is selected from the best effort queue which will provide the free resources to schedule the deadline sensitive lease. But in some scenario backfilling algorithm does not provide better scheduling if there is similar types of leases and must be in conjugative in sequence. This work aims to use AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) as a decision maker in the backfilling algorithm to choose the possible best lease from the given best effort queue in order to schedule the deadline sensitive lease. The proposed work improves the performance of the backfilling algorithm by scheduling more number of leases and minimizing the lease rejection using AHP.
