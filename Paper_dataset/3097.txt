AB Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPSs) are standalone complex hardware, expensive to purchase, change and manage. The emergence of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking (SDN) mitigates these challenges and delivers middlebox functions as virtual instances. Moreover, cloud computing has become a very cost-effective model for sharing large-scale services in recent years. Features such as portability, isolation, live migration, and customizability of virtual machines for high-performance computing have attracted enterprise customers to move their in-house IT data center to the cloud. In this paper, we formulate the placement of Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) and introduce a model called Incremental Mobile Facility Location Problem (IMFLP) to study the IDPP problem. Moreover, we propose a novel and efficient solution called Adaptive Facility Location (AFL) to efficiently solve the optimization problem introduced in the IMFLP model. The effectiveness of our solution is evaluated through realistic simulation studies compared with other popular online facility location algorithms.
