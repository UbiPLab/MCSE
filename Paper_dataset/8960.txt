AB This paper presents an effective mobile cloud-based interactive 3D rendering and streaming system with data-service cost constraints over heterogeneous wireless networks. The proposed system contains software-defined networking ( SDN)enabled adaptive cloud resource management module and context-aware 3D rendering and streaming module to enhance the quality-of-service of interactive 3D rendering and streaming services. The first module is designed to efficiently control the limited cloud resources, such as server computing power and available backbone link bandwidth, and the second module is implemented to pursue an effective tradeoff between 3D rendering quality and compressed image quality. The system is implemented using Mininet network emulator with an OpenDaylight SDN controller, and VirtualGL with an online open-source 3D game, PlaneShift. Finally, the system is examined at a mobile device connected to real long-term evolution and WiFi networks.
