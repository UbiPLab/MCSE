AB This article aims to examine the main factors that may hinder or facilitate the adoption of cloud computing (CC) services by higher educational institutions in developing countries, exemplified here by Oman. A conceptual model was developed through extending the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework. Data was collected from 387 IT decision makers working in four higher educational institutions in Oman using a cross-sectional survey. Data was analysed using structural equation modelling based on AMOS 22.0. The results show that behavioural intention (BI) towards adopting CC services in higher educational institutions was influenced by top management support, relative advantage, attitudes towards change, technology readiness, complexity, government regulation, peer pressure, and data concerns in their order of influencing power. These all together accounted for 58.3% of the variance in BI. However, compatibility, vendor lock-in and external expertise did not have an influence on BI. This research provides original insight for cloud computing adoption within Oman from a managerial and IT professional perspectives. Specifically, this research would be helpful for government agencies, cloud computing providers and policy makers at higher educational institutions. It will also explain the relatively low penetration rate of cloud computing services at present, which will help in formulating strategies to encourage the adoption and acceptance of CC services by Omani higher educational institutions, where CC is still considered an innovation.
