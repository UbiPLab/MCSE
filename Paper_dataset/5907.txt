ID ENCRYPTION
AB One of the major hurdles, in the way of cloud computing is data security. To triumph over this, many security mechanisms have been adopted. Cryptography is very beneficial among them because albeit the data can be accessed without authorization, it cannot be read. The Data owners must encrypt their data prior storing it on the cloud. This guarantees the secrecy of the crucial data which is accumulated on the public cloud storage. There are lots of cryptographic techniques that have been developed to ensure confidentiality but, most of them are based on complex mathematical calculations and equations. In this paper, a novel and unique encryption algorithm have been proposed which is inspired by DNA cryptography. The proposed algorithm is highly secure as it makes use of random encoding tables and it is very hard to speculate the original sequence. It provides multifold security. Certain transformations are applied over the encryption key before using it. Here, each character is encoded as a 7 bit character and further, as 5 bit character. The encoding is highly robust; therefore it is very difficult to break the ciphertext. The encryption process is highly dynamic. The same plaintext yields different ciphertext for every session.
