AB Service-level agreement (SLA) is a major issue in cloud computing because it defines important parameters such as quality of service, uptime, downtime, period of service, pricing, and security. However, the service may vary from one cloud service provider (CSP) to another. The collaboration of the CSPs in the heterogeneous multi-cloud environment is very challenging, and it is not well covered in the recent literatures. In this paper, we present two SLA-based task scheduling algorithms, namely SLA-MCT and SLA-Min-Min for heterogeneous multi-cloud environment. The former algorithm is a single-phase scheduling, whereas the latter one is a two-phase scheduling. The proposed algorithms support three levels of SLA determined by the customers. Furthermore, the algorithms incorporate the SLA gain cost for the successful completion of the service and SLA violation cost for the unsuccessful end of the service. We simulate the proposed algorithms using benchmark and synthetic datasets. The experimental results of the proposed SLA-MCT are compared with three single-phase task scheduling algorithms, namely CLS, Execution-MCT, and Profit-MCT, and the results of the proposed SLA-Min-Min are compared with two-phase scheduling algorithms, namely Execution-Min-Min and Profit-Min-Min in terms of four performance metrics, namely makespan, average cloud utilization, gain, and penalty cost of the services. The results clearly show that the proposed algorithms properly balance between makespan and gain cost of the services in comparison with other algorithms.
