AB The existing Internet of Things(IoT) uses cloud computing data access storage algorithms, that is, the hash algorithm has defects of low data processing efficiency and low fault tolerance rate. Therefore, HDFS is introduced to optimize cloud computing data access storage algorithms. HDFS is first used to optimize the data access storage architecture according to problems of data access storage architecture in the Internet of Things, in which factors of data access storage distribution in the IoT are fully considered, and hash values are used to optimize the configuration of data access information storage locations, so that data access storage distribution strategy can be optimized. Then, the topology of the IoT is optimized, and data block size is also optimized with effect algorithm. Finally, the design of file storage is optimized. Through simulation experiments, it is proved that the optimized cloud storage method has obvious performance advantages in file read and write speed as well as memory usage. Compared with the traditional hash algorithm, optimization algorithm proposed in the paper greatly improves file upload and download efficiency, data processing efficiency and fault tolerance rate, which fully demonstrates that the proposed cloud computing data access storage optimization algorithm is more superior.
