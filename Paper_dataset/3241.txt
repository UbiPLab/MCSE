AB The burgeoning capabilities of Web browsers to exploit full-featured devices can turn the huge pool of social connected users into a powerful network of processing assets. HTML5 and JavaScript stacks support the deployment of social client-side processing infrastructure, while WebGL and WebCL fill the gap to gain full GPU and multi-CPU performance. Mobile Grid and Mobile Cloud Computing solutions leverage smart devices to relieve the processing tasks to be performed by the service infrastructure. Motivated to gain cost-efficiency, a social network service provider can outsource the video analysis to elements of a mobile grid as an infrastructure to complement an elastic cloud service. As long as users access to videos, batch image analysis tasks are dispatched from the server, executed in the background of the client-side hardware, and finally, results are consolidated by the server. This paper presents SaW (Social at Work) to provide a pure Web-based solution as a mobile grid to complement a cloud media service for image analysis on videos.
