AB In recent years, a large number of edge computing devices have been used to monitor the operating state of industrial equipment and perform fault diagnosis analysis. Therefore, the fault diagnosis algorithm in the edge computing device is particularly important. With the increase in the number of device detection points and the sampling frequency, mechanical health monitoring has entered the era of big data. Edge computing can process and analyze data in real time or faster, making data processing closer to the source, rather than the external data center or cloud, which can shorten the delay time. After using 8 bits and 16 bits to quantify the deep measurement learning model, there is no obvious loss of accuracy compared with the original floating-point model, which shows that the model can be deployed and reasoned on the edge device, while ensuring real time. Compared with using servers for deployment, using edge devices not only reduces costs but also makes deployment more flexible.
