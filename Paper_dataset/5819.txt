AB Mobile-edge computation offloading (MECO) is a promising emerging technology for battery savings in mobile devices (MD) and/or in latency reduction in the execution of applications by (either total or partial) offloading highly demanding applications from MDs to nearby servers such as base stations. In this paper, we provide an offloading strategy for the joint optimization of the communication and computational resources by considering the blue trade-off between energy consumption and latency. The strategy is formulated as the solution to an optimization problem that minimizes the total energy consumption while satisfying the execution delay limit (or deadline). In the solution, the optimal transmission power and rate and the optimal fraction of the task to be offloaded are analytically derived to meet the optimization objective. We further establish the conditions under which the binary decisions (full-offloading and no offloading) are optimal. We also explore how such system parameters as the latency constraint, task complexity, and local computing power affect the offloading strategy. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the behavior of the proposed strategy and verify its energy efficiency.
