AB Cloud computing is the recent evolving arena, which offers more benefits to cloud service providers and online users, compared to the traditional architecture. In this paper, an efficient datahosting scheme with high availability for implementing over heterogeneous multi-cloud system is proposed. The proposed ROBUST CHARM (RCH) scheme is designed with data hosting, storage mode switching, speed mode and workload indicator modules. These modules process data with the support of heuristic and storage mode transition algorithm. The algorithm is proved efficient in identifying the apt cloud to store data. Storage transition is adopted by considering the cost and data access pattern of the data stored during any requirements. This evaluation enables efficient usage of cloud resources with high availability. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme works effectively without affecting the performance compared to the existing systems. The ability to utilize heterogeneous multi-cloud storage with the benefit of cost effectiveness is an added advantage to the cloud users.
