AB The intersection operation on multisets has many applications in different scenarios, such as data mining and pattern matching. This motivates us to study the problem that when users outsource their private encrypted sets and delegate the set-intersection operation on the corresponding plaintexts to the cloud, the cloud can manage to conduct the operation and make the result verifiable without the decryption capability. We formally introduced a model of Verifiable Intersection Operations on Encrypted Data in Cloud and presented the definitions of the correctness and security properties. We also proposed a concrete scheme basing on the bilinear-map accumulator and re-encryption. The scheme was proved secure under some cryptographic assumptions. And the experimental results of the algorithm implementation show the scheme is partly practical for real scenarios. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
