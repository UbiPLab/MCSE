AB Multi-access edge computing (MEC) is a new 5G enabling technology proposed to reduce latency by bringing cloud computing capability closer to IoT and mobile device users. MEC may be prone to unreliable communication as a result of deadlock during resource provisioning. Deadlock may occur due to a huge number of devices contending for a limited amount of resources if adequate measures are not put in place. It is crucial to eradicate deadlock while scheduling and provisioning of resources on MEC to achieve highly reliable and available system. In this paper, a deadlock avoidance resource provisioning algorithm is proposed for Industrial IoT devices using MEC platforms to ensure the higher reliability of network interactions. The proposed scheme incorporates a banker's resource-request algorithm using software-defined networking to reduce communication overhead. Simulation Results have shown that system deadlock can be prevented by applying the proposed algorithm which ultimately leads to a more reliable network interaction between mobile stations and MEC platforms.
