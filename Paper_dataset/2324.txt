AB Electronic signature is a quick and convenient tool, used for legal documents and payments since business practices revolutionized from traditional paper-based to computer-based systems. The growing use of electronic signature means they are used in many applications daily, both in government and private organizations such as financial services, where an electronic signature is taken from group of people at once to cash checks or perform a transaction approval. However, non-repudiation and authentication issues remain highlighted concerns for electronic signature. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a TokenSign system that uses revocable fingerprints biotokens with Secret Sharing as electronic signature. TokenSign maintains two layers of security. First, TokenSign scheme transforms and encrypts a user fingerprint data. Second, TokenSign embeds a shared secret inside the encrypted fingerprints. Then, TokenSign Scheme distributes all shares of electronic signatures over multiple clouds. During the matching/signing process, TokenSign utilizes threading to do parallel matching for the fingerprints in its secure encrypted form without decrypting the data. Finally, TokenSign scheme applies Secret Sharing scheme to compute the shared secret, producing an electronic signature. As a result, our experiments show that TokenSign scheme achieves comparable accuracy and improves performance comparing to the two baselines.
