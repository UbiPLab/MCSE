AB Recently, we introduced PLanetary Atmospheric Tool for Observer Noobs (PLATON), a Python package that calculates model transmission spectra for exoplanets and retrieves atmospheric characteristics based on observed spectra. We now expand its capabilities to include the ability to compute secondary eclipse depths. We have also added the option to calculate models using the correlated-kmethod for radiative transfer, which improves accuracy without sacrificing speed. Additionally, we update the opacities inPLATON-many of which were generated using old or proprietary line lists-using the most recent and complete public line lists. These opacities are made available atR = 1000 andR = 10,000 over the 0.3-30 mu m range, and atR = 375,000 in select near-IR bands, making it possible to utilizePLATONfor ground-based high-resolution cross-correlation studies. To demonstratePLATON's new capabilities, we perform a retrieval on published Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Spitzer transmission and emission spectra of the archetypal hot Jupiter HD 189733b. This is the first joint transit and secondary eclipse retrieval for this planet in the literature, as well as the most comprehensive set of both transit and eclipse data assembled for a retrieval to date. We find that these high signal-to-noise data are well matched by atmosphere models with a C/O ratio of 0.66(-0.09)(+0.05) and a metallicity of 12(-5)(+8) times solar where the terminator is dominated by extended nanometer-sized haze particles at optical wavelengths. These are among the smallest uncertainties reported to date for an exoplanet, demonstrating both the power and the limitations of HST and Spitzer exoplanet observations.
