AB In hybrid clouds, inter-cloud links play a key role in the execution of jobs with data dependencies. Insufficient available bandwidth in inter-cloud links can increase the makespan and the monetary cost to execute the application on public clouds. Imprecise information about the available bandwidth can lead to inefficient scheduling decisions. This paper attempts to evaluate the impact of imprecise information about the available bandwidth in inter-cloud links on workflow schedules, and it proposes a mechanism to cope with imprecise information about the available bandwidth and its impact on the makespan and cost estimates. The proposed mechanism applies a deflating factor on the available bandwidth value furnished as input to the scheduler. Simulation results showed that the mechanism is able to increase the number of solutions with makespans that are shorter than the defined deadline and reduce the underestimations of the makespan and cost provided by workflow schedulers.
