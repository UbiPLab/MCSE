AB This article argues that a big data network joint SDN, together with cloud and fog computing platforms, can build a service chain network. In SDN, the purpose is to reduce a large amount of redundant data and response time. We propose a novel Big Data Orchestration as a Service (BDOaaS) as the networking framework, which can dynamically orchestrate big data into services in SDN. In BDOaaS networking, the data center distributes software to all devices in the distributed network, which can orchestrate big data into services in the distributed network; the services-oriented network model is formed. Thus, the network load and response time is reduced. The BDOaaS framework and various components of BDOaaS as well as operation mechanisms are discussed in detail. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed BDOaaS framework. In addition, we discuss a number of challenges in implementing the proposed framework in next generation networks.
