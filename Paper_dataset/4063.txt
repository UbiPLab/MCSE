AB The use of emerging technologies such as cloud computing, Internet of Things, and Big Data, is increasing as tools to assist the management of data and information related to energy systems grow. This allows for greater flexibility, scalability of solutions, optimization of energy use, and management of energy devices. In this sense, the objective of this research is to present the basic elements and requirements for the energy cloud and its management and discuss the main management challenges and opportunities for the development and diffusion of the energy cloud. This study was based on a systematic review carried out to identify the elements that compose the energy cloud and what is necessary for its management, and to list the challenges and opportunities that may be explored by researchers and practitioners. The results show that the layout for the energy cloud and its management can be structured in layers and management support blocks' format. It was found that 70 basic elements make up the main layers and 36 basic elements make up the management support blocks. The findings of this article also provide insights into the technical, scientific, and management development necessary for the evolution of energy systems toward the cloud computing environment.
