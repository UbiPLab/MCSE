AB Benefiting from the real-time processing ability of edge computing, computing tasks requested by smart devices in the Internet of Things are offloaded to edge computing devices (ECDs) for implementation. However, ECDs are often overloaded or underloaded with disproportionate resource requests. In addition, during the process of task offloading, the transmitted information is vulnerable, which can result in data incompleteness. In view of this challenge, a blockchain-enabled computation offloading method, named BeCome, is proposed in this article. Blockchain technology is employed in edge computing to ensure data integrity. Then, the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III is adopted to generate strategies for balanced resource allocation. Furthermore, simple additive weighting and multicriteria decision making are utilized to identify the optimal offloading strategy. Finally, performance evaluations of BeCome are given through simulation experiments.
