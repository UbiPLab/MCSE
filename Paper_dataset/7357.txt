AB In this letter, we propose a Hadoop-based Video Transcoding System (HVTS), which is designed to run on all major cloud computing services. HVTS is highly adapted to the structure and policies of Hadoop, thus it has additional capacities for transcoding, task distribution, load balancing, and content replication and distribution. To evaluate, our proposed system, we carry out two performance tests on our local testbed, transcoding and robustness to data node and task failures. The results confirmed that our system delivers satisfactory performance in facilitating seamless streaming services in cloud computing environments.
