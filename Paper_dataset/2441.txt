AB Intelligent customized services are required to meet the needs of users. Data concerning the user's environment is needed more so the situation of the user can be determined for providing a highly reliable service. In order to collect a large amount of data, the Internet of Things (IoT), which connects numerous devices through the Internet, has been developed. Cloud computing is widely used for managing data efficiently, but can delay data transmission. Therefore, fog computing has been proposed. However, the method used to manage data securely in the cloud computing environment is not efficient in the fog computing environment. Moreover, data may contain personally sensitive information. Additionally, various stakeholders may exist in relation to the access authority of the information. In this respect, there can be many vulnerabilities and threats. In response, this study proposed a re-encryption technique for managing data securely in the fog computing environment. This technique allows a user to delegate the decryption authority to decrypt encrypted data using the re-encryption method in the proxy server for efficient communication.
