AB The results of the theoretical and experimental studies of the problems of designing, implementation and use of open cloud based learning and research environment in a higher education institution are covered in the article. The scientific and methodological foundations of the research, the conceptual and terminological apparatus, the methodological principles of environmental design are outlined, the general model and methodical system of its formation and development are substantiated. The model reflects the features of the process of formation and development of the environment, aimed at achieving the goals of the pedagogical system, among which there are the formation of an ICT-competent specialist; increasing access to ICT; use of modern tools and technologies in education and research. The methodological system encompasses a number of methods that are integrated on the system-forming factor of a cloud-based approach that relies on relevant baseline characteristics and service models. The system includes: the method of using a research-educational cloud of an institution, aimed at improving the organization and increasing the efficiency of scientific research, implementation of their results; the method of using the cloud learning components based on the AWS hybrid cloud as well as specialized domain-oriented services. The ways of methods selection within the proposed model in pedagogical systems of higher education are characterized, the ways of their use are determined. The experience of implementation and use of individual services and components of cloud-based learning and research environment in higher education institutions of Ukraine has been analyzed and evaluated. The results of experimental studies of the use of cloud-based services in the process of scientific, scientific-pedagogical and pedagogical personnel training are presented. The analysis and evaluation of the prospects for the development of the cloud-based learning and research university environment is presented basing on the proposed approaches.
