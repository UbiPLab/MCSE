AB In this work, the Dirac equation is studied in the z = 0 Lifshitz black hole (Z0LBH) spacetime. The set of equations representing the Dirac equation in the Newman-Penrose (NP) formalism is decoupled into a radial set and an angular set. The separation constant is obtained with the aid of the spin weighted spheroidal harmonics. The radial set of equations, which are independent of mass, is reduced to Zerilli equations (ZEs) with their associated potentials. In the near horizon (NH) region, these equations are solved in terms of the Bessel functions of the first and second kinds arising from the fermionic perturbation on the background geometry. For computing the boxed quasinormal modes (BQNMs) instead of the ordinary quasinormal modes (QNMs), we first impose the purely ingoing wave condition at the event horizon. Then, Dirichlet boundary condition (DBC) and Newmann boundary condition (NBC) are applied in order to get the resonance conditions. For solving the resonance conditions, we follow the Hod's iteration method. Finally, Maggiore's method (MM) is employed to derive the entropy/area spectra of the ZOLBH which are shown to he equidistant.
