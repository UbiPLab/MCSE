AB Cloud computing and big data provide rich data resources. The intelligent informationization has developed rapidly, promoting the intelligent development of college education. For the same educational methods and teaching modes, students have different cognitive functions. This paper studies the application of intelligent informatization in college teaching, and constructs a cognitive function model in education and teaching. The research results show that, with the intelligent informationization in college teaching, the interaction of teacher-student-machine three subject theory is achieved, providing an efficient, open and diverse learning environment. Cognitive function involves human brain activities and thoughts. The application of intelligent informatization in college education can realize the difference evaluation of students, greatly reduce the workload of teachers, and continuously improve students' cognitive ability. This paper provides a theoretical basis for the application of intelligent informatization in college education and the construction of students' cognitive functions.
