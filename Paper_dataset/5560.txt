AB Healthcare today is one of the most promising, prevailing, and sensitive sectors where patient information like prescriptions, health records, etc., are kept on the cloud to provide high quality on-demand services for enhancing e-health services by reducing the burden of data storage and maintenance to providing information independent of location and time. The major issue with healthcare organization is to provide protected sharing of healthcare data from the cloud to the decision makers, medical practitioners, data analysts, and insurance firms by maintaining confidentiality and integrity. This article proposes a novel and secure threshold based encryption scheme combined with homomorphic properties (TBHM) for accessing cloud based health information. Homomorphic encryption completely eliminates the possibility of any kind of attack as data cannot be accessed using any type of key. The experimental results report superiority of TBHM scheme over state of art in terms throughput, file encryption/decryption time, key generation time, error rate, latency time, and security overheads.
