AB Load balance plays an important role in the information acquisition system's performance. Especially in the state of cloud storage, the load balance is well done, which is conducive to the full utilization of computing resources and reduces the response time of distributed operations. The internal mechanism of original page load balance is given based on the analysis of the two recent commonly used dynamic load balance methods. Five original page oriented load balancing strategies are compared from the experimental and theoretical perspectives on the premise of calculating load index. Finally, the conclusion is drawn that date channel storage calculation sensitive partition is the most optimal load partition strategy.
