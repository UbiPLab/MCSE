AB To develop smart city and intelligent manufacturing, video cameras are being increasingly deployed. In order to achieve fast and accurate response to live video queries (e.g., license plate recording and object tracking), the real-time high-volume video streams should be delivered and analyzed efficiently. In this article, we introduce an end-edge-cloud coordination framework for low-latency and accurate live video analytics. Considering the locality of video queries, edge platform is designated as the system coordinator. It accepts live video queries and configures the related end cameras to generate video frames that meet quality requirements. By taking into account the latency constraint, edge computing resources are subtly distributed to process the live video frames from different sources such that the analytic accuracy of the accepted video queries can be maximized. Since the amount of required edge computing resource and video quality to accurately address different video queries are unknown in advance, we propose an online video quality and computing resource configuration algorithm to gradually learn the optimal configuration strategy. Extensive simulation results show that as compared to other benchmarks, the proposed configuration algorithm can effectively improve the analytic accuracy, while providing low-latency response.
