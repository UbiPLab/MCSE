AB Cloud computing is one of the most emerging technologies which has created a revolution in the High performance Computing (HPC) domain. The term Quality of Service (QoS) plays a vital role in the formation of more flexible integration of various technologies. The Waiting Time (WT), Turnaround Time (TAT), Context Switching (CS) and Makespan (MS) are the primary parameter that has great impact on the scheduling of cloudlets. The Proposed algorithm has improved the resource utilization system of the existing Round Robin Algorithm (RRA) and Improved Round Robin Cloudlet Scheduling Algorithm (IRRCSA) by introducing the concept of dynamically calculated Time Quantum (TQ) for each virtual machine (VM) according to the allocated cloudlets. This new approach in cloudlet scheduling drastically reduced average WT, average TAT and Number of CS of the VMs, which further enhanced the capability of cloud service providers (CSPs) to provide better QoS.
