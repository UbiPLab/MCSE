ID CLOUD COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT
AB Private set intersection (PSI) protocols enable 2 parties to compute the intersection of their inputs without compromising anything about the datasets beyond the intersection. With the advent of cloud computing, outsourcing computation has been attracted wide range of attention from research community and applied widely in the industry. The cloud computing allows resources restrained devices to outsource their expensive computation to the cloud. Based on Abadi's O-PSI, we present a variant of delegated private set intersection protocol secure in the semi-honest model under RSA assumption, and we also give an efficient and secure outsourcing computation algorithm for RSA cryptosystem. Depending on this algorithm, we transform a variant of delegated private set intersection protocol into an improved outsourced one. It enables the clients only to perform simple modular multiplication for computing what they want during the execution of protocol. Besides, the variant of delegated protocol can be easily extended to multiple clients. Compared with the state of the art, our proposed protocol has great advantage in efficiency. We finally evaluate these protocols and prove their security in the semi-honest model.
