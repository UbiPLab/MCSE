AB The growth in cloud computing adoption is phenomenal in organizations worldwide due mainly to its potential to increase productivity and enhance efficiency in business operations. However, cloud adoption is very low in many organizations in the developing countries. To gain insights into organizations' behavioral intention and usage behavior of cloud computing, based on the Extended Unified Technology Acceptance and Use Theory, the current study investigated the effects of technological, organizational, and environmental factors on cloud adoption in organizations. Using samples from five industry sectors and by employing the Structural Equation Model, the study found that facilitating conditions, habit, performance expectancy, and price value had positive and significant effect on behavioral intention to use cloud computing. But, effort expectancy, social influence, lack of motivation, and inadequate security were found to be barriers to cloud adoption. These findings could contribute toward better formulation of planning guidelines for successful adoption of cloud computing.
