ID ENCRYPTED DATA
AB With the rapid development of cloud computing, more and more data owners are motivated to outsource their data to cloud for various benefits. Due to serious privacy concerns, sensitive data should be encrypted before being outsourced to the cloud. However, this results that effective data utilization becomes a very challenging task, such as keyword search over ciphertexts. Although many searchable encryption methods have been proposed, they only support exact keyword search. Thus, misspelled keywords in the query will result in wrong or no matching. Very recently, a few methods extends the search capability to fuzzy keyword search. Some of them may result in inaccurate search results. The other methods need very large indexes which inevitably lead to low search efficiency. Additionally, the above fuzzy keyword search methods do not support access control. In our paper, we propose a searchable encryption method which achieves fuzzy search and access control through algorithm design and Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-based Encryption (CP-ABE). In our method, the index is small and the search results are accurate. We present word pattern which can be used to balance the search efficiency and privacy. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and analyze the security of the proposed method.
