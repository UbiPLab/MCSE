AB The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a vital role in the real world by providing autonomous support for communications and operations, thus enabling and promoting novel services that are commonly used in day-to-day life. It is important to do research on security frameworks for next-generation IoT and develop state-of-the-art confidentiality protection schemes to deal with various attacks on IoT networks. In order to offer prominent features like continuous confidentiality, authentication, and robustness, the blockchain technology comes out as a sustainable solution. A blockchain-enabled distributed security framework using edge cloud and software-defined networking (SDN) is presented in this article. The security attack detection is achieved at the cloud layer, and security attacks are consequently reduced at the edge layer of the IoT network. The SDN-enabled gateway offers dynamic network traffic flow management, which contributes to the security attack recognition through determining doubtful network traffic flows and diminishes security attacks through hindering doubtful flows. The results obtained show that the proposed security framework can efficiently and effectively meet the data confidentiality challenges introduced by the integration of blockchain, edge cloud, and SDN paradigm.
