ID SWARM OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM
AB Mobile cloud computing has become a research hotspot in the fields of cloud computing and mobile computing. At present, many researches on offloading computation to cloud resource and their related work have been done and some achievements have been obtained in the field of mobile cloud computing. However, some problems of the current researches have also been found such as the separation between computation and data, limited network resource, and lack of location-aware, etc. In this paper, we have presented a novel mobile cloud computing model and proposed a heuristic approach MCC-particle swarm optimization (PSO) of placement selection of mobile applications' partitions for minimizing the overall processing time and energy saving. The algorithm of the proposed MCC-PSO approach includes two parts. One is that it combines the PSO idea with the simulated annealing (SA) idea to achieve an improved PSO-based approach with the better global search's ability. The other one is that it uses the probability theory and mathematical statistics and once again utilizes the SA idea to deal with the data obtained from the improved PSO-based process to get the final solution. And thus the whole approach achieves a long-term optimization of mobile cloud computing. The experimental results demonstrate that MCC-PSO evidently reduces the overall processing time of mobile applications and energy consumption of mobile devices while better guaranteeing the performance of executing mobile applications. MCC-PSO better achieves the idea of mobile cloud computing and makes the mobile cloud computing model more high-effective and meaningful.
