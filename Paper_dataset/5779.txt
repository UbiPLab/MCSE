AB Purpose The article proposes a new method of strategic analysis. The method was called the grey portfolio analysis method. The presented method is complementary to the popular BCG matrix. The use of the grey portfolio analysis method enables to make a dynamic portfolio analysis for data with a high level of uncertainty. Design/methodology/approach First, the article presents current problems related to the application of portfolio methods in strategic management, in particular with reference to the BCG matrix. Second, the basics of grey numbers, operations with them and the way of acting in the grey portfolio analysis method are presented. Finally, the developed method is presented in a case study concerning an IT enterprise, whose portfolio includes cloud computing services. Findings In the article, a new method of a strategic analysis based on the BCG matrix was presented. It combines grey methodologies of decision making with a grey prognostic model in the context of a strategic analysis. Due to this fact, a dynamic approach to the issues of portfolio methods is possible. Practical implications The article fits the current need related to the development of new expert systems supporting strategic management in enterprises. Originality/value An introduced method is new and innovative in the area of portfolio methods. Its originality results from the fact that it eliminates a static nature of the BCG matrix through the use of grey prognostic models. What is more, when grey numbers are used, a problem of uncertainty of information, which appears, is solved at a methodological level.
