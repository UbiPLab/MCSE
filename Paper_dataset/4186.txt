AB Cumulus is a cloud-based framework enabling large-scale single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing data analysis.
   Massively parallel single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing has opened the way to systematic tissue atlases in health and disease, but as the scale of data generation is growing, so is the need for computational pipelines for scaled analysis. Here we developed Cumulus-a cloud-based framework for analyzing large-scale single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing datasets. Cumulus combines the power of cloud computing with improvements in algorithm and implementation to achieve high scalability, low cost, user-friendliness and integrated support for a comprehensive set of features. We benchmark Cumulus on the Human Cell Atlas Census of Immune Cells dataset of bone marrow cells and show that it substantially improves efficiency over conventional frameworks, while maintaining or improving the quality of results, enabling large-scale studies.
