AB Load imbalance is a problem faced by the distributed cloud computing platform. It often requires the information collaboration by each server in the cluster to carry out the container migration. Most of the algorithms which aim to reduce the downtime do not consider migration cost of the containers and perform some unnecessary migration. In this paper, with the aim to reduce the unnecessary migration of containers, an optimal minimum migration algorithm (OMNM) is proposed. By fitting the growth rate of Docker containers in the source server, the model can estimate the growth trend of each Docker container and determine which container needs to be migrated. While ensuring the load balancing of the cluster, the number of the migration is reduced, and the utilization ratio of the resource is improved. Experimental results show that the algorithm is effective to reduce the total number of live migration of Docker containers and reduce the workload of migration. Finally, it achieves the load balancing of cloud resources.
