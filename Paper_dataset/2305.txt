AB This paper proposes a context-aware museum-guide system, which is able to present information on exhibits in accordance with visitor needs. Other features of the system include planning and directing a visit as well as providing locations, facilities and additional services. The architecture is designed based on the attribute-driven design method. It consists of two components including mobile and server components. The server component is located in the cloud and is regarded as the backup for the mobile component. The software architecture analysis method is employed to evaluate the proposed architecture. To this end, some scenarios have been codified for system functionalities by consulting museum experts. The proposed architecture satisfies the scenarios by resolving the issues arisen in each one. The CIF-based questionnaire method indicates a high usability score for the proposed system. Finally, comparison of the capabilities of the proposed system with related research reveals that it benefits from a comprehensive design.
