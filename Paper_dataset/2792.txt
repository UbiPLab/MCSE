AB In the new era of the Internet of Things (IoT), all information related to the environment, things and humans is connected to networks. Humans, too, can be considered an integral part of the IoT ecosystem. The growing human-centricity of IoT applications raises the need greater dynamicity, heterogeneity, and scalability in future IoT systems. Recently, the IoT and cloud computing have both evolved as emerging technologies and have already become part of our daily life. The complementary features of the IoT and cloud are forming a new IT paradigm to meet current and future requirements. Due to the increased demand for and volume of IoT data, it has become a critical challenge to transfer data from the edge of the network to computing data centers due to the limitations of network bandwidth and higher latency delay. The emergence of the new paradigm of computing in the cloud computing architecture has made it necessary to overcome the inherent limitations of cloud computing, such as location awareness, scalability, energy efficiency, mobility, bandwidth bottlenecks, and latency delay. To address these issues, this paper proposes an efficient hybrid cloud architecture framework coupled with Li-Fi communication for a human-centric IoT network. It also introduces the architecture of the local cloud to reduce the latency delay and bandwidth cost and to improve efficiency, security, reliability and availability. Finally, the paper discusses the communication modulation schemes in the Li-Fi technique and presents scenarios involving the application of the proposed model in the real world.
