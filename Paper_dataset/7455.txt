AB Multilevel programming problems model a decision-making process with a hierarchy structure. Traditional solution methods including vertex enumeration algorithms and penalty function methods are not only inefficient,to obtain the solution of the multilevel programming problems, but also lead to a paradox that the follower's decision power dominates the leader's. In this paper, both multilevel programming and intuitionistic fuzzy set are used to model problems in hierarchy expert and intelligent systems. We first present a score function to objectively depict the satisfactory degrees of decision makers by virtue of the intuitionistic fuzzy set for solving multilevel programming problems. Then we develop three optimization models and three interactive intuitionistic fuzzy methods to consider different satisfactory solutions for the requirements of expert decision makers. Furthermore, a new distance function is proposed to measure the merits of a satisfactory solution. Finally, a case study for cloud computing pricing problems and several numerical examples are given to verify the applicability and the effectiveness of the proposed models and methods.
