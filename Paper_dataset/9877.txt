AB According to parallel computing technology, Cloud service is popular, and it is easy to use Cloud service at everywhere. Cloud means involving application systems that are executed within the cloud and operated via the internet enabled devices. Cloud computing does not rely on the use of cloud storage as it will be removed upon users download action. Clouds can be classified as public, private and hybrid. Cloud service comes up with Ubiquitous; Cloud service users can use their service at anywhere at any time. It is convenient. However, there is a tradeoff. If user's username and password are compromised, user's cloud system is in danger, and their confidential information will be in jeopardy. At anywhere and anytime with any device, Cloud user's credential could be in jeopardy. Security concerns in Cloud play a major role. It is the biggest obstacle to developing in Cloud. However, Cloud is still popular and vulnerability for hacking because of one channel user authentication. Therefore, this research proposes two-channel user authentication by using USB to emphasise security.
