AB With cloud storage and service sharing, cloud users in one group can easily read, compile and modify shared data. To guarantee correctness of the data blocks stored on the cloud server, the users need to generate signatures on all the stored data sharing among these users. Usually, once a user compiles a data block, he/she needs to regenerate a signature for the modified data. Considering the security of sharing information, when a user is removed from the group, the signatures which were generated by this user should be transformed to valid signature by the master user. In our paper, we construct a public verification scheme to check correctness of the shared data blocks with efficient user revocation. By blinding the shared data block, the cloud server cannot obtain any shared data information. Through security and experimental analysis, we demonstrate that our scheme is secure and efficient compared with its relevant schemes.
