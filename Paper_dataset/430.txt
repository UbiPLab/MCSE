AB Cloud computing, as a new computing paradigm, offers dynamically scalable and seemly unbounded storage and computation resources in a pay-as-you-go manner. In order to enjoy superior data services and reduce the local maintenance cost, more and more resource-constrained users prefer to outsource their data to the cloud server. However, outsourcing data to the remote server suffers from data security concerns, because the server may try to learn the information of the outsourced data as much as possible for commercial purpose. The traditional encryption technique can protect the confidentiality of users' data, however, it leads to the loss of search ability over the encrypted data. Fortunately, searchable encryption, as a promising solution, enables the server to perform keyword-based search over encrypted data. Recently, the design of searchable encryption scheme is becoming more and more diversified, aiming to improve the practicability of the scheme. This paper focuses on the current research for searchable encryption scheme in four aspects, including single keyword search, multi-modal search, forward/ backward secure search and verifiable search. This paper mainly introduces and analyzes the representative research results, summarizes the latest research progress and key technical difficulties, and finally prospects the future research direction.
