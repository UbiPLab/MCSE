AB Cloud computing offers a model in which the user has the idea of unlimited resources. Allied with this idea, cloud computing also provides another advantage that allows the user to pay only what is consumed, this model is also known as pay as you go. These and other factors led to a broad adoption of services offered by cloud computing. However, when the users migrates their applications to the cloud, they faced several possibilities of providers, resources, brokers, and services. Through a analysis of articles and books relevant to the subject, we propose a taxonomy in order to classify cloud brokers according to their main features. The references mention several features, but this work keeps focused in migration of virtual infrastructures between Infrastructureas-a-Service (IaaS) providers.
