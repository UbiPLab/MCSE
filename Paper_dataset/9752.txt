AB We focus on a cloud computing environment by using open source software such as OpenStack and Eucalyptus because of the unification management of data and low cost. A cloud computing is attracting attention as a network service to share the computing resources, i.e., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services. We propose jump diffusion models based on stochastic differential equations in order to consider the interesting aspect of the provisioning process. In particular, we propose an estimation method of the network traffic density in the cloud computing. Also, we analyze actual data to show numerical illustrations of application of the reliability-oriented network management considering the characteristics of cloud computing.
