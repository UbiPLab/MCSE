AB Cloud computing is an on-demand Internet-based computing service, where computing resources are shared among the users via the Internet and its usage based on the pay-for-use model. Virtualization of computing resources allows the system to use the resources efficiently. One of the challenging issues in virtualization is the placement of virtual machine (VM) on the physical machines (PMs) in order to utilize computing resources efficiently. Furthermore, imbalanced usage of resources also leads to overall resource wastage of an IaaS cloud. In this paper, we propose a new VM placement algorithm called RVMP for IaaS cloud. The first objective of the proposed algorithm is to minimize the power consumption of the IaaS cloud by reducing the number of active PMs. We devise a new technique called resource usage factor to place a VM on a suitable PM so that resources of the PM can utilize efficiently. The second objective is to minimize the unbalanced utilization of resources among the active PMs. We propose a new resource usage model by which one can successfully figure out unbalanced utilization of resources on the active PMs. By using the proposed model, we adopt a limited migration of VMs to minimize the unbalanced utilization of resources. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compared with the existing algorithms in terms of various performance metrics. The simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm.
