DE Cloud computing OpenStack Docker Virtualization
AB As an emerging technology in cloud computing Docker is becoming increasingly popular due to its high speed high efficiency and portability. The integration of Docker with OpenStack has been a hot topic in research and industrial areas e.g. as an emulation platform for evaluating cyberspace security technologies. This paper introduces a high-performance Docker integration scheme based on OpenStack that implements a container management service called Yun. Yun interacts with OpenStack's services and manages the lifecycle of the container through the Docker Engine to integrate OpenStack and Docker. Yun improves the container deployment and throughput as well as the system performance by optimizing the message transmission architecture between internal components the underlying network data transmission architecture between containers and the scheduling methods. Based on the Docker Engine API Yun provides users with interfaces for CPU memory and disk resource limits to satisfy precise resource limits. Regarding scheduling Yun introduces a new NUMA-aware and resource-utilization-aware scheduling model to improve the performance of containers under resource competition and to balance the load of computing resources. Simultaneously Yun decouples from OpenStack versions by isolating its own running environment from the running environment of OpenStack to achieve better compatibility. Experiments show that compared to traditional methods Yun not only achieves the integration of OpenStack and Docker but also exhibits high performance in terms of deployment efficiency container throughput and the container's system while also achieving load balancing.
