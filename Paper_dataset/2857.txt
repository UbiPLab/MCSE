DE Cloud computing; keyword search; proxy re-encryption; provable security
AB With the widespread use of cloud computing technology, more and more users and enterprises decide to store their data in a cloud server by outsourcing. However, these huge amounts of data may contain personal privacy, business secrets and other sensitive information of the users and enterprises. Thus, at present, how to protect, retrieve, and legally use the sensitive information while preventing illegal accesses are security challenges of data storage in the cloud environment. A new proxy re-encryption with keyword search scheme is proposed in this paper in order to solve the problem of the low retrieval efficiency of the encrypted data in the cloud server. In this scheme, the user data are divided into files, file indexes and the keyword corresponding to the files, which are respectively encrypted to store. The improved scheme does not need to re-encrypt partial file cipher-text as in traditional schemes, but re-encrypt the cipher-text of keywords corresponding to the files. Therefore the scheme can improve the computational efficiency as well as resist chosen keyword attack. And the scheme is proven to be indistinguishable under Hash Diffie-Hellman assumption. Furthermore, the scheme does not need to use any secure channels, making it more effective in the cloud environment.
