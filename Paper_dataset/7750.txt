AB The aim of this paper is to investigate the usability of high-frequency channels for deep-space (DS) transmissions exploiting radiometeorological forecast modeling. A previously developed model chain for DS link-budget optimization, based on numerical weather forecasts (WFs), is adopted. The latter, already tested at Ka-band, exploits the combination of a high-resolution mesoscale forecast model and a radiative transfer model to predict the atmospheric scenario and optimize received data volume (DV) during DS transmissions. To shift available Ka-band results to other frequencies, we apply frequency-scaling laws to extrapolate forecast path attenuation, link parameters, and maximum allowed bit-rate for data transmission. Exploiting the available WF-based methodology, we compute DV return for DS missions operating at X-, K-, Ka-, Q-, and W-bands in order to make a comparative study of the behavior of DS transmission-channels at these frequencies. Results show that, in terms of received DV, an innovative WF-based approach is more convenient than traditional methodologies and exhibits a trend similar to the benchmark (ideal case). Increasing link frequency, received DV increases up to Q-band. From Q-to W-band, despite received DV does not increase significantly, lost data remain under reasonable values, thus making the W-band suitable if coupled with a WF-based technique.
