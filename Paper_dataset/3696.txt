AB In spite of Cloud Computing services seem to be very attractive as an alternative to traditional on-premise data centers, there is still some concern about the providers availability. This article describes a solution that implements high availability Multi-Cloud through the distribution of DNS access and the use of reverse proxy. The results obtained, by means of simulations indicate that, in principle, one can obtain an arbitrary Multi-Cloud availability, by using Clouds of lower availability. Specifically, it was shown that, from two Clouds of 99.43% and 99.49% availability one can obtain a 99.9971% Multi-Cloud system. It is also shown that, in this particular case, the Multi-Cloud system costs 34% less than the solution with a single Cloud.
