AB Innovative digital technologies, such as cloud computing, big data, AI, and IoT are now familiar to us, and the digitalization of society is accelerating. A "connected society," formed by connecting all things such as people and things with data, is affecting the structure of social and economic systems and dramatically changing our daily lives. Digital innovation has brought us a "connected society" and is now advancing the digitalization of customers' business environments and businesses in an unstoppable manner. As these changes bring improved convenience, at the same time, we are confronted with emerging new threats, causing cybersecurity to become indispensable in protecting systems and data. Cybersecurity has now become the core foundation of Fujitsu's every business, and we recognize that is our mission to sustain our capability in cybersecurity to keep earning customer's trust. This paper describes Fujitsu's approach on cybersecurity in support of a connected society.
