AB OBJECTIVE: To maintain the stable operation of cloud computing-based power safety management software.
   METHODS: Through the analysis of cloud computing software, the paper proposes relevant improvement strategies based on the shortcomings of these software.
   RESULTS AND ANALYSIS: Through the TAO architecture for security services, safe communication is achieved to ensure stable operation.
   CONCLUSION: The security service structure designed in this paper has made two application modes possible, including the user-independent general security agent mode and the interface method-level fine security control mode, and the infrastructure improves the reliability of software operation and is worthy of promotion.
