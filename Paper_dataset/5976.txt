AB Appearance of highly intelligent and advanced robots that react and recognize to their environment has lead to the increment in the complexity of the embedded systems that govern their reaction. This developing multifaceted nature, over a timeframe, has influenced the general responsiveness and battery life of the robot. From controlling a drone to an internet controlled coffee maker, an on-board processor for the calculation of all control signs is required for setting off a reaction to the stimuli. At the point when the unpredictability of the embedded system rises, more convoluted computation is required to react to those inputs. This has not only reduced the general responsiveness and battery life of the robot but also has additionally prompted the need of overhauling the equipment to suit the upsurge in the calculation required. The solution to this problem is by offloading the critical tasks like control signal computation or image processing to a centralized server which would eliminate the requirement of complex on-board processors. A comprehensive analysis is presented on the feasibility of such code offloading in embedded robotic systems and its applicability to other domains is discussed. The obtained results will be compared to the results obtained in other domains involving code offloading and analysed to strike out any patterns in their results.
