AB Modern software development for services computing and cloud computing software systems is no longer based on a single database but on existing multidatabases and this convergence needs new software architecture and framework design. Most current popular frameworks are not designed for multidatabases, and many practical problems in development arise. This study designs and implements a software development framework called Java data access service (JDAS) for multidatabases using the object-oriented programming language Java. The JDAS framework solves related problems that arise when other frameworks are employed in practical software development with multidatabases by presenting and introducing design methods. JDAS consists of the modules of the database abstract, object relational mapping, connection pools management, configuration management, data access service, and inversion of control. Results and case study reveal that the JDAS framework effectively reduces development complexity and improves development efficiency of the software systems with multidatabases.
