AB Emerging technology applications such as mobile cloud computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and 5G promot Elastic Optical Network (EON) to play an important role in the backbone transmission network. Degraded Service (DS) technology can provide a new way to reduce traffic congestion and improve spectrum utilization in EON. Firstly, considering the problems of unfair resource allocation and neglecting the Quality of Experience (QoE) of low-priority services in existing DS algorithms, a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) model with the joint objective of minimizing downgrade frequency, downgrade level and Transmission Delay Loss (TDL) is established. A Delay-aware Degradation-Recovery Routing and Spectrum Assignment (DRR-RSA) algorithm for degraded recovery is proposed. In order to improve the QoE of downgraded services and the revenue of operators, the strategy of degradation recovery is integrated in the optimal DS-window selection phase of the algorithm. Under the premise of guaranteeing the transmission data quantity unchanged, the degradable services are restored to the free spectrum domain, so as to increase the spectrum efficiency, reduce degraded service TDL and maximize revenue. Finally, the simulation results tesfity that the proposed algorithm has advantages in terms of traffic congestion, revenue and degraded service success-rate.
