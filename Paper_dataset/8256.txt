AB Air pollution has emerged as a major threat to public health. Due to vehicular pollution and industries, the exposure to toxic particulate matter pollution (PM2.5 and PM10) is alarmingly high in major cities. Silver birch trees are good in absorbing the PM in the air. The characteristics of silver birch trees are briefed in this paper. The present study analyses the air quality standards and compares it with various pollutant parameters and health inferences. The PM values are also analysed globally and nationally. In this paper, we have analysed and then suggested to monitor and minimize air pollution parameter especially particulate matter by planting silver birch trees in urban cities. Reducing emissions of particulate matter not only has an instant effect on air quality, but also moderates climate change. By controlling the environmental pollution, the cities are devoid of health issues and other harmful effects. Further by using the technologies of Internet of Things and cloud computing, the measured sensor values are suggested to store in cloud storage and communicated to the authorities. Hence, it will be monitored continuously and helps to save the environment.
