AB Digital innovative technologies have enabled organisations to create opportunities to support their competitive advantage. In this regard, realising the dynamics influencing the adoption of these technologies becomes critical to their success. While much attention has been focused on the technological development, implementation and employees' adoption, little has been done to examine the specifics of digital innovation influencing technology uptake in organisations. Drawing from Technology Organisation and Environment framework, this paper examines the factors affecting innovation dynamics adoption in the context of cloud computing for SMEs. The findings obtained from IT and senior managers highlight that while innovative IT capabilities, organisational innovativeness, perceived innovation risk, perceived innovation barriers influence the likelihood for SMEs adopting cloud computing as an innovative solution, IT innovation-driven competitiveness has limited influence. As such, this demonstrates how understating the specifics of innovation dynamics can help in offering the required support for SMEs in sustaining success.
