AB Mobile cloud computing (MCC) is an emerging technology that is introduced to combat the existing limitations in mobile computing such as constrained energy and storage. MCC enables mobile users to perform their tasks in the operator cloud and benefit from the offered services. On the other hand, operators are required to decrease their costs to stay in the competitive market. In this paper, we propose a method to reduce the cost of power consumption and increase the profit of 4G/5G network operators delivering MCC services. We propose an online method that is based on dynamic processing of mobile users' demands based on their power consumption in the cloud, called Dyn-PDPC. In this algorithm, the power consumption of demands is estimated based on event counters, and demands are classified and processed accordingly. Unlike the offline methods, the proposed online method can be implemented with the existing information and there is no need for prior knowledge. We also present an extended version of Dyn-SP algorithm, in which we had an unrealistic assumption about the energy consumption of demands. In Dyn-PDPC, by using control parameters, when the electricity price is low, demands with high power consumption are processed, and then the low power-consumption demands are processed. Similarly, when the electricity price is high, demands with low power consumption are processed at first. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has more accuracy, and more reduction in long-term cost compared to other online methods in MCC networks.
