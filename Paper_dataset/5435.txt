ID DATA-ACQUISITION SYSTEM
AB In this project we propose, describe, implement and test the Renewable Energy Monitoring System (REMS), a new concept on data acquisition and transmission systems (DATS) applied to real-time cloud monitoring of a decentralized photovoltaic (PV) plant. To achieve this latest design, we went through various systems projects alongside the evolution of technology. From this practical experience and in agreement with Brazil's policy of diversifying the electricity generation matrix, our proposal focuses on a multi-user remote system using Raspberry Pi and Internet of Things (IoT) concept. REMS is capable of sensing and modifying monitoring process management via remote firmware update through the developed Analog/Digital Converter Embedded System (ADCES) as well as communicating with a personal developed cloud server profile via RPi Embedded Linux System (ELS), thus not requiring a dedicated PC. The measured variables are PV voltage and current, ambient and PV module temperature, solar irradiance, and relative humidity.
