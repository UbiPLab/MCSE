AB Cloud technology is emerging as a widely accepted technology in the recent years due to its robust nature. Cloud computation is basically developed on the fact that the resources can be shared between numerous devices to achieve efficient network operation among devices with minimized computation expenses. However, the sharing nature poses a security risk for the devices whose resources are being shared. Almost in all the existing works on cloud security, a single trusted third party (TTP) is used for key issue and authorization. However, using a single TTP may results in single-point failure and security risks. Most of the previous works on cloud security focus on storage security rather than considering the computation security. In order to solve these issues, in this paper, multi-authority-based file hierarchy hidden CP-ABE scheme for cloud security is proposed. In this scheme, the files are arranged in hierarchical order based on their attribute weights. Then when a cloud user needs certain resources, it requests the cloud service provider (CSP). The CSP links with the cloud owner to provide the requested file after encrypting it. The cloud server encrypts and places the encrypted file in CSP, which is later retrieved by cloud user. In this way, all the files that are being used are encrypted along with strict authentication to ensure cloud security.
