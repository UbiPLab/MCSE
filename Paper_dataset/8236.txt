AB Next generation communication relies on standardized protocols, heterogeneous architectures and advanced technologies that are envisioned to bring ubiquitous and seamless connectivity. This evolution of communication will not only improve the performance of the existing networks, but will also enable various applications in other fields while integrating different heterogeneous systems. This massive scaling of mobile communication requires higher bandwidth to operate. 5G promises a robust solution by offering ultra-low latency and high bandwidth for data transmission. To provide individuals and companies with a real-time, social, and all connected experience, an end-to-end coordinated architecture which is agile and intelligent has to be designed at each stage. As FPGA has the potential to be resource/power efficient, it can be used for building up constituents of 5G infrastructure. It can accelerate network performance without making a large investment in new hardware. Dynamic reconfigurability and in-field programming features of FPGAs compared to fixed function ASICs help in developing better wireless systems. This article presents various application areas of FPGAs for the upcoming 5G network planning.
