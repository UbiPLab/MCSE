AB The Cloud Computing Paradigm's Private Cloud deployment model for the majority of Small and Medium Enterprises is a cost, effective and secure solution for achieving nimbly the computation infrastructure demand. Nowadays it's adoption has been hindered due to the lack of methods that allow facing the design of Private Clouds from a business perspective; and because of the high compute requirements that impose the commercial solutions with greater presence in the market in relation to the low requirements of compute resources that these enterprises demand for supporting their Information and Communication Services. The present work exposes a study of the state of the art that shows the problematic situation afore mentioned, and proposes a general framework that lays the foundations for developing a Private Cloud method design with the necessary procedures, instruments and design principles for designing from the perspective of the business and with a top-down philosophy.
