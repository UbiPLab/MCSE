AB Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) consist of numerous sensors which lack capacities in computing, storage and communication. With the development of Cloud Computing, sensor networks can be combined with the cloud to extend its computation and storage abilities. In this paper, we overviewed the current sensor-cloud literature and found that the existing sensor-cloud still has several problems, such as high timelag, weak dependability, security risks and so on. According to our investigation, Fog Computing, as a new computing architecture, can address the above problems by introducing elastic resources and local services to the underlying sensors. We also studied the fog computing features specifically in WSNs, and then proposed a new fog computing framework where multiple mobile elements are used to bridge WSNs and Cloud. We further presented some typical applications in forest monitoring, airplane condition monitoring and disaster detection. Finally, we summarized several open issues for future research.
