AB Recent advances in communications, controls, and embedded systems have changed the perception of a car. A vehicle has been the extension of the man's ambulatory system, docile to the driver's commands. It is now a formidable sensor platform, absorbing information from the environment (and from other cars) and feeding it to drivers and infrastructure to assist in safe navigation, pollution control, and traffic management. The next step in this evolution is just around the corner: the Internet of Autonomous Vehicles. Pioneered by the Google car, the Internet of Vehicles will be a distributed transport fabric capable of making its own decisions about driving customers to their destinations. Like other important instantiations of the Internet of Things (e.g. the smart building), the Internet of Vehicles will have communications, storage, intelligence, and learning capabilities to anticipate the customers' intentions. The concept that will help transition to the Internet of Vehicles is the vehicular fog, the equivalent of instantaneous Internet cloud for vehicles, providing all the services required by the autonomous vehicles. In this article, we discuss the evolution from intelligent vehicle grid to autonomous, Internet-connected vehicles, and vehicular fog.
