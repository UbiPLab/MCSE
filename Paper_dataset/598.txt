ID OPTIMIZATION
AB With the continuous integration of cloud computing, edge computing, and Internet of things (IoT), various mobile applications will emerge in future 6G network. Driven by real-time response and low energy consumption requirements, mobile edge-cloud computing (MECC) will play an important role to improve user experience and reduce costs. However, due to the complexity of applications, the computing capacity of devices cannot meet the low-latency and low energy consumption requirement. Meanwhile, subject to the limited supplement of power and energy system, the heterogeneous multilayer mobile edge-cloud computing (HetMECC) is proposed to join cloud server, edge server, and terminal devices for data calculation and transmission. By dividing computing tasks, terminal applications can receive reliable and efficient computing services. The simulation results show that the proposed model can achieve the low-latency requirement of data calculation and transmission and improve the robustness of architecture.
