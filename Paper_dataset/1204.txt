AB Internet of Things (IoT) as a concept wasn 't officially named until 1999 where it still used by big computer and communication companies. It is the connection objects with each other anywhere, anytime, via internet communication without human intervention. Communication is the main part of IoT. With the development of technology and the revolution in a smart cell phone, the connected devices reach billions which lead to a fast increase in the transmitted data through the network. This rapid increase results in a heavy load on servers which need more processing and routing time. Fog Computing and Cloud computing paradigm extend the edge of the network, thus enabling a new variety of applications and services. In this paper, we focus on the modeling of the fog computing architecture and compare its performance with the traditional model. We present a comparative study with traditional IoT architecture based on classifying applications, define a priority for each application, and use the cell operator as the main fog center to store data. Then we give a solution to decrease data transmission time, reduce routing processes, increase response speed, reduce internet usages, and enhance the overall performance of IoT systems.
