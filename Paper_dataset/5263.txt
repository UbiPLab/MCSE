AB Wind climate, wave climate and current pattern numerical modeling studies that are crucial in the determination of hydromorphological properties of coastal waters, have been performed. Modeling system has been applied to Samsun Bay coastal waters. In the study, hourly wind measurements of Samsun Regional Meteorological Station between 1970-2016; measurements of Marine Automatic Meteorological Observation Station between January 2014-March 2016; measurements of wave buoy located at deep coastal waters of the bay between August 2015-March 2016; predictions with six hours interval of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) operational archive at the coordinates of 41.3 degrees N-36.4 degrees E, 41.4 degrees N-36.4 degrees E and 41.5 degrees N-36.4 degrees E between 2000-2016; regular monthly measurements carried out for the physical parameters and currents in Samsun Bay coastal waters between May 2015-May 2016; and geographic information system (GIS) and cloud computing based, three dimensional hydrodynamic, turbulence and transport model system HYDROTAM-3D predictions, have been used. The verification studies performed by the comparisons of predictions and measurements have proved the success of modeling for the wind climate, wave climate and current patterns in the Samsun Bay coastal waters and have shown that model system can be used as a powerful coastal areas management tool.
