AB The purpose of this article is to develop a cloud computing adoption scale for Indian manufacturing, service, and process Industries. The scale development procedure has been followed from the previous studies and is refined further for clear understanding to adopt easily. In the first step, we have conducted a qualitative study for item selection. The second step includes pilot testing of 110 responses for measurement scale purification and finally, we are validating the scale with 660 sample respondents through convergent validity and discriminant validity. The initial result showed very poor threshold values for the items "Top management support" and "Marketplace establishment" which are having a strong literature support. This measurement scale will help managers to evaluate the level of cloud adoption to increase the business performance. The study is a first time attempt to develop a validated scale for cloud adoption that can be used in Indian Industries.
