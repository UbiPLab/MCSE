AB With the development of modern science and technology as well as the steady advancement of urbanization, intelligent networks have emerged and are replacing traditional networks with the identity of next-generation networks. And information security is one of the most important research directions in the intelligent network construction. In order to resist the threat of privacy leakage during the data transmission of intelligent terminal, an original four-layer fog computing system which is suitable for intelligent network data collection, transmission, and processing structure is established in the paper. With the help of the Paillier algorithm for encryption and fine-grained aggregation, the fine-grained aggregated data as coefficients are embed in the cloud node, and Horner's rule is conformed for unary polynomials, which further aggregates to reduce the amount of transmitted data, so that communication overhead is reduced as well. Meanwhile, the resolvability of Horner's rules allows EPSI to finally obtain the subregional information plain text, and it is summed up to obtain cloud-level information data. Therefore, the comparative analysis of simulation experiments with other algorithms proves that the rational optimization of the research content in this paper plays a higher security role.
