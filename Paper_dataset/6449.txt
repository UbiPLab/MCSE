AB Data management is the core module of cloud storage system. Constructed network topology of data center, the data management model of Recursion-based N-regular Polygon Topology (RNPT) was established referring to file systems as Google File System (GFS) and Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). The model uses central server mode as well as RNPT network structure to ensure system scalability. In addition to achieve high replica availability and reliability, the replica is reasonably allocated to reduce user access time, decrease communication delay as well as effectively cooperative load balancing strategy. The system resource is adequately used in the model to improve cloud storage performance and service quality. Comparison to HDFS by simulation experiments using CloudSim shows that the RNPT-based data management model can improve data access performance and reasonably utilize network bandwidth so that load balancing is achieved.
