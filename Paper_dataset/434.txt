AB Purpose: (1) To compare the acetabular coverage between dysplasia, borderline dysplasia, and control acetabulum in a quantitative 3-dimensional manner; and (2) to evaluate correlations between the radiologic parameters and the 3-dimensional zonal-acetabular coverage. Methods: We reviewed contralateral hip computed tomography images of patients 16 to 60 years of age who underwent 1 of 3 types of surgeries: eccentric rotational acetabular osteotomy, curved intertrochanteric varus osteotomy, and total hip replacement with minimum 1-year follow-up from January 2013 to April 2018. A point-cloud model of the acetabulum created from computed tomography was divided into 6 zones. Threedimensional acetabular coverage was measured radially at intervals of 1 degrees. Mean radial acetabular coverage for each zone was named ZAC (zonal acetabular coverage) and was compared among the 3 subgroups (control: 25 degrees <= lateral center-edge angle [LCEA] <40 degrees; borderline: 20 degrees <= LCEA <25 degrees; and dysplasia: LCEA <= 20 degrees) statistically. Further, the correlations between the ZAC in each zone and the LCEA were analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Results: One-hundred fifteen hips were categorized as control (36 hips), borderline (32 hips), and dysplasia (47 hips). The mean anterocranial ZAC in the borderline (87.5 +/- 5.7 degrees) was smaller than that in the control (92.6 +/- 5.9 degrees, P = .005) but did not differ compared with the dysplasia (84.5 +/- 7.6 degrees, P = .131). In contrast, the anterocaudal (71.2 +/- 5.0 degrees), posterocranial (85.0 +/- 6.4 degrees), and posterocaudal (82.4 +/- 4.5 degrees) mean ZACs in the borderline were not different from those in the control (anterocaudal, 74.3 +/- 4.6 degrees, P = = .090; posterocranial, 87.9 +/- 4.3 degrees, P = .082; posterocaudal, 85.1 +/- 5.0 degrees, P = .069) respectively. Although there was a very strong positive correlation with supra-anterior ZAC and LCEA (r = 0.750, P <.001), the correlation between the anterocranial ZAC and LCEA was relatively weak (r = 0.574, P <.001). Conclusions: The anterosuperior acetabular coverage in the borderline dysplastic acetabulum is more similar to the dysplastic acetabulum than to the normal acetabulum.
