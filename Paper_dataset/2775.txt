AB Cloud computing (CC) systems are the most popular computational environments for providing elastic and scalable services on a massive scale. The nature of such systems often results in energy-related problems that have to be solved for sustainability, cost reduction, and environment protection.
   In this paper we defined and developed a set of performance and energy-aware strategies for resource allocation, task scheduling, and for the hibernation of virtual machines. The idea behind this model is to combine energy and performance-aware scheduling policies in order to hibernate those virtual machines that operate in idle state. The efficiency achieved by applying the proposed models has been tested using a realistic large-scale CC system simulator. Obtained results show that a balance between low energy consumption and short makespan can be achieved.
   Several security constraints may be considered in this model. Each security constraint is characterized by: (a) Security Demands (SD) of tasks; and (b) Trust Levels (TL) provided by virtual machines. SD and TL are computed during the scheduling process in order to provide proper security services.
   Experimental results show that the proposed solution reduces up to 45% of the energy consumption of the CC system. Such significant improvement was achieved by the combination of an energy-aware scheduler with energy-efficiency policies focused on the hibernation of VMs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
