AB With the development of China's economy, the fierce market competition, and the expansion of the enterprise scale, determining how to retain and manage outstanding talents has a significant function in enterprise development in our country. Compared with large enterprises in Europe and America, the human resource management (HRM) system in our country has various hardware and software logic problems because of its late start. Cloud computing is a new technology where a large amount of information can be stored in the cloud, which provides users with unlimited storage space and super computing power. The application of cloud computing technology in an HRM system can improve the operating efficiency of businesses, reduce operating costs, reasonably allocate resources, and promote the development of enterprise information technology. Importantly, with the help of cloud computing technology, small businesses can achieve the same level of management as large enterprises. Therefore, this paper focuses on the application of cloud computing in an HRM system and hopes to provide a new idea for expanding the enterprise management mode.
