AB The applications that are being installed and run on the mobile devices need a platform of services offered on-demand and be reliable. These services are promised by cloud computing, where resource allocation plays a major role in providing the services and delivering the quality of service (QoS) to the cloud users. The task of provisioning the resources to the cloud users becomes challenging considering the proliferation in the number of users using the cloud on every day basis. The users in this context of proliferation can be considered as mobile nodes that need faster access to communicate among different devices and services. In this paper, the resource allocation on cloud is considered as a game between the clients or the users of the cloud submitting their tasks onto the cloud. Further, a utility maximisation approach as a game theoretic model for an efficient resource allocation in cloud computing is explored in this paper.
