AB The Internet of things (IoT) in the cloud has been increasingly utilized in recent years as more and more network data are being processed. It plays an important role in the distributed processing of networks by applying fog computing to process huge volumes of data. Distributed fog computing has the advantage of distributed processing, but a new architecture is required to ensure the high performance and simple management of distributed networks. CF-CloudOrch needs to solve many problems, including security, flexibility, high performance, scalability, and efficiency, which are IoT and distributed fog computing. This paper proposes a new container fog node-based cloud orchestration that meets the requirements. The proposed CF-CloudOrch is a prototype of a network management with a lighter container technology than virtualization. CF-CloudOrch understands flow diagrams through prototype implementation and service scenarios and presents a comparative analysis with other environments. Finally, the IoT network contributes to future IT research through efficient and simple management.
