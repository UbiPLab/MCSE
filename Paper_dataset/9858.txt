AB Aim: Cloud computing [11] is a tremendous growth in every years and it can be utility the computing and large storage capability to the public users. The data owner can store the data in the cloud server is called data outsourcing and then the cloud data access for public users through the cloud server. The outsourced data are contains sensitive privacy information and it can be encrypted before uploaded to the cloud server and then the search user can access to the data through the cloud server is some difficulty of searching over the encrypted data in cloud. In this paper address this problem by developed the fine-grained multi-keyword search scheme over encrypted data in the cloud. There are three contribution of this paper. First one is, to provided relevance scores and preference factors upon keywords which enabled the precise keyword search. Second one is, to developed a complicated logic search the mixed AND, OR and NO operations of multi-keyword search scheme. And finally, auxiliary employ the classified sub-dictionaries technique to accomplish the index building, trapdoor generating and query. By using this experiments to the real-world dataset, so easily retrieve the result from dataset.
