AB Due to advantages such as flexibility, mobility and cost-saving, the pushing of data storage and processing into the cloud has been a key trend in many enterprises. Recently, researchers have found that there is a growing limitation in the meeting of the computing and network bandwidths for the cloud when supported systems such as the Internet of Things (IoT) are used. Instead of establishing channels for the cloud storage and utilisation, edge-centric computing places some of the processes and resources near to the users; however, its utilisation has raised security concerns about the data usage, and the existing secure mechanisms in the cloud are no longer suitable for data protection at the edge. In this paper, the security issues of cloud data at the edge are studied. We present several challenges and opportunities for edge computing and demonstrate the impact of privacy leakage in IoT applications.
