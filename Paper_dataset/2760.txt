AB Hybrid clouds are increasingly used to outsource non-critical applications to public clouds. However, the main challenge within such environments, is to ensure a cost-efficient distribution of the systems between the resources that are on/off premises. For Multi Agent Systems (MAS), this challenge is deepened due to irregular workload progress and intensive communication between the agents, which may result in high computing and data transfer costs. Thus, in this paper we propose a generic framework for adaptive cost-efficient deployment of MAS with a special focus on hybrid clouds. The framework is based mainly on the use of a performance evaluation process that consists of simulating various partitioning options to estimate and optimize the overall deployment costs. Further, to cope with the irregular workload changes within a MAS and dynamically adapt its initial deployment, we propose an extended version of the Fiduccia-Mattheyses algorithm (E-FM). The experimental results highlight the efficiency of E-FM and show that an efficient MAS deployment to hybrid clouds depends on various factors such as the cloud providers and their different cost-models, the network state, the used partitioning algorithm, and the initial deployment.
