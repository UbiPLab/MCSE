AB As a key technology of cloud computing, virtualization technology enables multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a host to meet the operational needs and environmental requirements of different applications, improving the efficiency of the host. However, the resource of the hosts is limited. When the VMs runs too many tasks, the host will be overloaded and exception occurs. Regarding the issue above, this paper considers the communication cost of virtual machine (VM) migration and proposes a VM Migration Algorithm based on Gene Aggregation Genetic Algorithm (VMM-GAGA). VMM-GAGA mainly solves the problem of allocation between VMs which to be migrated and underutilized hosts. In VMM-GAGA, a novel genetic coding method based on gene aggregation algorithm is proposed. The algorithm performs gene aggregation operations on VMs that have more communication and meet the conditions, which effectively reduces the number of genes in the chromosome., Experiments show that compared with the traditional genetic algorithm, VMM-GAGA reduces search time and communication costs.
