ID SECURITY; NETWORKS
AB VCC leverages the underutilized storage and computing resources of vehicles to collaboratively provide traffic management, road safety, and infotainment services to end users, such as drivers and passengers. It is a hybrid technology that improves the resource utilization on vehicles and is able to perform complex computing tasks that cannot be handled by a single vehicle. Despite the appealing advantages, security and privacy threats are severe in VCC due to the sharing of resources among unfamiliar vehicles. In this article, we identify security goals for the interoperability with VCC and provide an AKA framework for VCC. Specifically, we first present the research challenges and open problems for designing a reliable AKA with strong security guarantees for VCC. Then we propose an integrated AKA framework that integrates the single-server 3-factor AKA protocol and the non-interactive identity-based key establishment protocol, and evaluate its performance based on a simulated experimental platform. Finally, several interesting issues are discussed to light up the further research directions on AKA for VCC.
