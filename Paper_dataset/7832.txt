AB In recent years, the number of tourists of domestic travel as well as travel route recommendations on the travel websites are growing fast. Tourists have difficulty in choosing optimal travel route. To solve this problem, we offer a decision model about optimal travel route based on Analytic Hierarchy Process(AHP). By collecting and analyzing the existing data from various travel websites, this model can recommend the optimal travel route to the users, offering them convenience when making choices. In this model, multiple selection factors (decision criterion), which were concerned by consumer; are taken into account and then decision criterions will be ranked synthetically by establishing the hierarchy model of these factors. Finally, judgement and sort for travel route are made based on the decision criterions, and then the final results could be obtained by means of conformance testing. Based on above work, the optimal travel route could be decided and given out.
