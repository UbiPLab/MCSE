AB With the rapid growth in connected vehicles, FoG-assisted vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is an emerging and novel field of research. For information sharing, a number of messages are exchanged in various applications, including traffic monitoring and area-specific live weather and social aspects monitoring. It is quite challenging where vehicles' speed, direction, and density of neighbors on the move are not consistent. In this scenario, congestion avoidance is also quite challenging to avoid communication loss during busy hours or in emergency cases. This paper presents emergency message dissemination schemes that are based on congestion avoidance scenario in VANET and vehicular FoG computing. In the similar vein, FoG-assisted VANET architecture is explored that can efficiently manage the message congestion scenarios. We present a taxonomy of schemes that address message congestion avoidance. Next, we have included a discussion about comparison of congestion avoidance schemes to highlight the strengths and weaknesses. We have also identified that FoG servers help to reduce the accessibility delays and congestion as compared to directly approaching cloud for all requests in linkage with big data repositories. For the dependable applicability of FoG in VANET, we have identified a number of open research challenges.
