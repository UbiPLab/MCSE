AB We report on a study comparing coronal flux ropes inferred from eruption data with their interplanetary counterparts constructed from in situ data. The eruption data include the source-region magnetic field, post-eruption arcades, and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Flux ropes were fit to the interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs) considered for the 2011 and 2012 Coordinated Data Analysis Workshops (CDAWs). We computed the total reconnected flux involved in each of the associated solar eruptions and found it to be closely related to flare properties, CME kinematics, and ICME properties. By fitting flux ropes to the white-light coronagraph data, we obtained the geometric properties of the flux ropes and added magnetic properties derived from the reconnected flux. We found that the CME magnetic field in the corona is significantly higher than the ambient magnetic field at a given heliocentric distance. The radial dependence of the flux-rope magnetic field strength is faster than that of the ambient magnetic field. The magnetic field strength of the coronal flux ropes is also correlated with that in interplanetary flux ropes constructed from in situ data, and with the observed peak magnetic field strength in ICMEs. The physical reason for the observed correlation between the peak field strength in ICMEs is the higher magnetic field content in faster coronal flux ropes and ultimately the higher reconnected flux in the eruption region. The magnetic flux ropes constructed from the eruption data and coronagraph observations provide a realistic input that can be used by various models to predict the magnetic properties of ICMEs at Earth and other destination in the heliosphere.
