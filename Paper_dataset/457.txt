AB Internet-of-Things (IoT) environment has a dynamic nature with high risks of confidentiality, integrity, and availability violations. The loss of information, denial of access, information leakage, collusion, technical failures, and data security breaches are difficult to predict and anticipate in advance. These types of nonstationarity are one of the main issues in the design of the reliable IoT infrastructure capable of mitigating their consequences. It is not sufficient to propose solutions for a given scenario, but mechanisms to adapt the current solution to changes in the environment. In this article, we present a multicloud storage architecture called WA-MRC-RRNS that combines the weighted access scheme, threshold secret sharing, and redundant residue number system with multiple failure detection/recovery mechanisms and homomorphic ciphers. We provide a theoretical analysis of the probability of information loss, data redundancy, speed of encoding/decoding, and show how to dynamically configure parameters to cope with different objective preferences, workloads, and cloud properties. We propose a multiobjective optimization mechanism to adjust redundancy, encryption-decryption speed, and data loss probability. Comprehensive experimental analysis with real data shows that our approach provides a secure way to mitigate the uncertainty of the use of untrusted and not reliable IoT infrastructure.
