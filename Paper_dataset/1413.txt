AB In order to enhance the efficiency and safety of production and management of modern agriculture in China, problems, such as the quality and safety of agricultural products and the pollution of the environment from agricultural activities, should be unraveled. Based on the new generation of information technology (IT), an integrated framework system platform incorporating the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, data mining, and other technologies is investigated and a new proposal for its application in the field of modern agriculture is offered. The experimental framework and simulation design suggest that the basic functions of the monitoring system of the IoT for agriculture can be realized. In addition, the innovation derived from integrating different technologies plays an important role in reducing the cost of system development and ensuring its reliability as well as security.
