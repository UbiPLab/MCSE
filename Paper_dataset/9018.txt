AB In recent years, due to rapid technological advancements such as big data utilization, cloud computing, mobile communications/devices, and social media, business owners have been urged to transform their information and communications technology (ICT) systems. However, many companies hesitate to embrace the ICT innovation because they have been incurring a lot of cost with the systems virtualization and integration they have carried out so far. To resolve this situation, Fujitsu proposes FUJITSU Integrated System PRIMEFLEX for Cloud K5 (hereafter, PFC-K5), an integrated private cloud solution. This solution is also one of the private cloud solutions of FUJITSU Digital Business Platform MetaArc. PFC-K5 provides an optimal combination of hardware and software for business operations on the cloud, and this solution is delivered to the business owners in a ready-to-use condition. PFC-K5 not only supports business operation lifecycle by providing optimal ICT systems, but also enables business owners to introduce the latest cloud technology to their ICT systems at low cost. Moreover, through infrastructure standardization and automation, business owners can use this solution to reduce their operational cost, and hence move forward with transforming their ICT system. This solution is based on the same technology as FUJITSU Cloud Service K5, making it possible to build a hybrid cloud environment. This paper describes an overview and the features of PFC-K5.
