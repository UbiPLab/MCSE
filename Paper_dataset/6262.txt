AB Key revocation and ciphertext update are two critical issues for identity-based encryption schemes. Designing an identity-based encryption scheme with key revocation and ciphertext update functionalities simultaneously is still a tricky challenge. Recently, Liang et al. introduce the notion of cloud-based revocable identity-based proxy re-encryption scheme and present a concrete scheme with aim to solve the challenge. In this paper, we first showed the scheme of Liang et al. cannot resist re-encryption key forgery attack and collusion attack. We then introduced a new cryptographic primitive, named cloud-aided revocable identity-based encryption scheme with ciphertext update (CA-RIBE-CU), to achieve both ciphertext update and key revocation for identity-based encryption schemes. We also defined the syntax and security model of CA-RIBE- CU scheme and proposed a CA-RIBE-CU scheme from bilinear pairings. Compared with the scheme of Liang et al., our proposed scheme is collusion resistant, takes lower decryption computation, and achieves constant size re-encrypted ciphertext. Finally, we proved the proposed scheme is adaptively secure under the decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption in the standard model. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
