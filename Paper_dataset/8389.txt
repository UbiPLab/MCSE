AB Here we present a cloud platform for e-health analysis. The goal of this research is to offers a standardized way to secure registry and share biometric impedance data from many volunteers of distinct locations. We perform the corporal analysis of a dataset from elderly volunteers who perform regular gym exercises. Our goal is to follow the evolution of health quality according to the percentage of body fat, hydration, and corporal lean mass. These factors can potentially indicate how physical exercises can contribute to improving the health quality of this population. Our result is two-fold: (a) a qualitative overview of the development of an open-source system for e-health analysis has many issues to host a useful large biometric dataset and (b) our preliminary analysis indicates that regular physical exercises contribute reducing corporal body fat, and improve the quality of health.
