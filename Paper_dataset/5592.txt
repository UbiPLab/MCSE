AB Fog computing is an emerging paradigm in provisioning computing and storage resources for the Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. In a fog computing system, all devices can offload their data or computationally intensive tasks to nearby fog nodes, instead of to the distant cloud. As compared with cloud computing, fog computing can significantly reduce the transmission delay between IoT devices and computing servers. However, the current fog system is rather susceptible to malicious attacks. To increase the security level, we propose to partition the fog system into fog node clusters (FNCs), with fog nodes (FNs) in one cluster sharing the same access control list (ACL) which is protected by a blockchain. Generating blockchains requires tremendous computing power and can rapidly drain the computing capacities of FNs. In this article, we first customize the blockchain for FNC to reduce the required computing power consumption and storage spaces. Second, a new scheme is designed for the blockchain-based FNC (BFNC) to recover ACL automatically. In addition, we propose a heuristic algorithm to reduce the time to acquire hash values of blocks by computing cooperatively with all available devices. The simulation results have demonstrated that using the cooperative computing strategy can reduce the time of computing a block hash than noncooperative strategies.
