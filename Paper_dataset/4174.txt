AB Since its inception, Blockchain has drawn lots of attention to the next generation of decentralized economies due to its structure that suits the digital transformation era. It has successfully changed many financial transaction systems in different organizations and has the potential to innovate current business models across different industries. One of blockchain important building blocks is the activity of applying transparency and security with cryptography and authentication of distributed peers. In this work, an overview of current blockchain protocols is demonstrated along with how it can potentially tackle current security and transparency concerns in cloud storage services. Further, a novel TSS Model of applying blockchain to cloud services to address transparency and secure access issues is presented and suggest future directions to advance research efforts into this field.
