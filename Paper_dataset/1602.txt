AB Code offloading is a promising way to accelerate mobile applications and reduce the energy consumption of mobile devices by shifting some computation to the cloud. However, existing code offloading systems suffer from a long communication delay between mobile devices and the cloud. To address this challenge, in this paper, we consider to deploy edge nodes in close proximity to mobile devices and study how they benefit code offloading. We design an edge-centric code offloading system, called Echo, over a three-layer computing hierarchy consisting of mobile devices, the edge, and the cloud. A critical problem needs to be addressed by Echo is to decide which methods should be offloaded to which computing platform (the edge or the cloud). Different from existing offloading systems that let mobile devices individually make offloading decisions, Echo implements a centralized decision engine at the edge. This edge-centric design can fully exploit limited hardware resources at the edge to provide offloading services with the quality-of-service guarantee. Furthermore, we propose some novel mechanisms, e.g., lazy object transmission and differential object update, to further improve system performance. The results of a small-scale real deployment and trace-driven simulations show that Echo significantly outperforms existing code offloading systems at both execution time and energy consumption.
