AB Cloud computing is a flexible, cost effective and proven delivery platform for providing business or consumer services over the Internet. Cloud computing supports distributed service over the Internet as service oriented architecture, multi-user, and multi-domain administrative infrasfructure, hence it is more easily affected by security threats and vulnerabilities. Cloud computing acts as a new paradigm where it provides a dynamic environment for end users and also guarantees Quality of Service (QoS) on data confidentiality. Trusted Third Party ensures the authentication, integrity and confidentiality of involved data and communications but fails on maintain the higher percentage of confidential rate on the horizontal level of privacy cloud services. TrustedDB on the cloud privacy preservation fails to secure the query parsers result for generating efficient query plans. To generate efficient privacy preserving query plans on the cloud data, we propose Shamir's Key Distribution based Confidentiality (SKDC) Scheme to achieve a higher percentage of confidentiality by residing the cloud data with polynomial interpolation. The SKDC scheme creates a polynomial of degree with the secret as the first coefficient and the remaining coefficients picked up at random to improve the privacy preserving level on the cloud infrasfructure. The experimental evaluation using SKDC is carried out on the factors such as system execution time, confidentiality rate and query processing rate, which improves the efficiency of confidentiality rate and query processing while storing and retrieving in cloud.
