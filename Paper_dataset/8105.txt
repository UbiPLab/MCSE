AB Nowadays, videos are extensively used in different aspects of our lives, thus, it is important to measure the quality of services offered by cloud providers. Therefore, we aim to study the impact of distance on the quality of video streaming services based on response time, packet end to end delay, and throughput. This study is conducted using simulation methodology and distance is specified by the propagation delay in public cloud environment. The results show that distance has significant impact on response time and packet end to end variation. However, throughput is not affected by long distances. In addition to that, the impact percentage varies for each kilometre from one application to another, as well for the same application. This study helps cloud providers to offer their services based on targeted consumers geographical locations in order to ensure high quality of service.
