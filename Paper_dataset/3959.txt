DE all-path query; graph encryption; searchable encryption
AB Since cloud computing and cloud storage have become a common practice in our daily life, people are paying more attention on protecting the privacy of their sensitive data. In this paper, we consider the problem of graph encryption in such a way that one can perform all-path queries over an encrypted graph in a privacy-preserving manner. A solution for such problem has many potential applications in network virtualization since graph data structures are commonly used to represent the topology of substrate and virtual networks. We propose a searchable symmetric encryption scheme for graph data that support all-path queries. The scheme allows a client to encrypt a sensitive graph and outsource it to an untrusted server for storage. After that, the client can perform arbitrary all-path queries between a source and a destination. For each query, the server computes and returns all the paths that satisfied the query. We prove that our scheme is secure against adaptive chosen-query attacks in the semi-honest setting.
