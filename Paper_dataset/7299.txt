AB In this paper, we applied an early developed statistic approach, based on mutual information namely "Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC)", to come up with a stable pattern, which is a roughly constant snapshot of interrelationships between all parametric sensors planted in different corners of the mechanic. That unaltered pattern reflects usual flawless condition that should be based on to decide the fault occurrence upon unconformity of further measurements. Secondly, we conducted a survey on exhaust gas temperatures via information entropy under its Kernel-extended version to select a subset of more informative features constructed to all the fault hints and C4.5 decision tree to flag data samples according to fault classes by means of selected features' partitioning rules. Data analyses revealed that outcomes from those two Shannon information theory derivatives are trustworthy and deserve more furtherance focus for the mechanical to be safely and effectively operated. The experiment result and data analysis shows the proposed method can improve the overall performance of the system substantially.
