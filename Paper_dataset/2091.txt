AB Cloud computing plays a major role in addressing the challenges of healthcare services such as diagnosis of diseases, telemedicine, maximize utilization of medical resources, etc. Early detection of chronic kidney disease on cloud environment is a big challenge that healthcare providers are facing. This paper concentrates on the using of intelligent techniques such as Decision Tree, Clustering, Linear Regression, Modular Neural Network, and Back Propagation Neural Network to address this challenge. In this paper, the researchers propose a hybrid intelligent model based on cloud computing for early revealing of chronic kidney disease. Two intelligent techniques were used: linear regression and neural network. Linear regression was used to define crucial factors that have an impact on chronic kidney disease. The proposed model for early revealing of chronic kidney disease was built using Neural Network. The accuracy of proposed model is 97.8%. This model outperforms on the other models existed in the previous works in terms of the accuracy and precision, recall and F1 score.
