AB Cloud computing has been established as a remarkable business model that allows the outsourcing of processing, memory, storage, and networking provided by cloud infrastructures. Cloud applications require computing resources being promptly available to serve the on-demand load. If resources are not available to meet user requests, service dependability and performance may be considerably impacted. Thus redundancy mechanisms are a suitable solution for rapidly providing resources to recover the failure in service delivery. However, one of the main difficulties in cloud infrastructures are related to the selection of redundancy mechanisms that can provide a high availability with acceptable costs. This paper provides a methodology, stochastic models and an optimization approach for assisting the planning of private cloud infrastructures, which are selected according to the availability, downtime and cost constraints. Two case studies based on cloud platform are adopted to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed work.
