AB To support multimedia applications, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) servers offer storage and computing ca-pacities to handle videos close to end-users. However, the high load in peak hours consumes the limited available bandwidth of existing cellular and backhaul links leading to low network performance. Hence, an elastic system model is required to maintain the high Quality of Experience (QoE) as the resource demands increase. Caching popular videos at mobile devices is considered a promising technique for content delivery. Yet, mobile users offer small capacities that are not adequate for large-sized video sharing. In this paper, we extend the collaborative caching and processing framework in edge networks (Collaborative Edge CE) to include the users' mobile video sharing (Device-to-Device D2D). We propose a caching strategy to cache only the chunks of videos to be watched and instead of offloading one video content by one edge node, helpers (MEC servers and users) will collaborate to store and share different chunks to optimize the storage/transmission resources usage. To only cache popular contents, we designed a D2D-aware proactive chunks caching on users' devices based on our chunks popularity model. Next, we formulate this CE-D2D collaborative problem as a linear program. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we introduce a sub-optimal relaxation and an online heuristic using the proactive caching and presenting a near optimal data offloading and a profitable payment determination, with polynomial time complexity. The simulation results show that our policies and heuristics outperform other edge caching approaches by more than 10% in terms of hit ratio, average delay, and cost.
