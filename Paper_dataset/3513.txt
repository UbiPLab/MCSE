AB Learning (and self-learning) is one of the most important activities in human professional and personal life. Over the past several years, there has been a very strong tendency to emphasize the electronic form of education. The aim is the students to have access to learning materials anytime, anywhere and through various types of electronic devices connected to Internet (desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, phablets, tablets, etc.). With the increasingly strong use of cloud technologies, many solutions have been provided for flexible planning and implementation of e-learning. The necessary knowledge is given in a modern, cheap and easily accessible way.
   This article overviews the concept and the services provided by cloud technologies. An example is presented for the use of cloud computing during the students' education at the Plovdiv University "Paisii Hilendarski" within the "Web programming" course realized on the base of WordPress and using the cloud platform CloudAccess.
