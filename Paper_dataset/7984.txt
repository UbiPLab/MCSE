AB Survivable design of cross-layer networks, such as the cloud computing infrastructure, lies in its resource deployment and allocation and mapping of the logical (virtual datacenter/IP) network into the physical infrastructure [cloud backbone/wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)] such that link or node failure(s) in the physical infrastructure would not result in cascading failures in the logical network. Most of the prior approaches for survivable cross-layer network design aim at single-link failure scenario, which are not applicable to the more challenging multifailure scenarios. Also, as many of these approaches use the cross-layer cut concept, enumeration of all cuts in the network is required and thus introducing exponential number of constraints. To overcome these difficulties, we investigate, in this paper, survivable mapping approaches against multiple physical link failures and its special case, shared risk link group (SRLG) failure. We present the necessary and sufficient conditions based on both cross-layer spanning trees and cutsets to guarantee a survivable mapping when multiple physical link failures occur. Based on the necessary and sufficient conditions, we propose to solve the problem through: mixed-integer linear programs that avoid enumerating all combinations of link failures; and an algorithm that generates/adds logical spanning trees sequentially. Our simulation results show that the proposed approaches can produce survivable mappings effectively against both k- and SRLG-failures.
