AB A process for designing an inverter-fed motor while taking into account the performance of the inverter is proposed. To draw a comparison, the classical approach to machine sizing is discussed and its shortcomings in achieving a more optimal solution to the motor-drive system design problem are pointed out. The results prove that designing the motor as an independent system may give less optimal solutions compared to the case where an integrated system is considered. Therefore, the machines and the inverters should be designed simultaneously. An inverterfed interior permanent magnet motor is investigated, and the corresponding design guidelines are presented. These guidelines are based on the knowledge extracted from an inclusively modeled, sampled, and simulated design space. The reliability of the design, the inverter efficiency, and the priorities of the transient, rated and flux weakening operations are assigned as the selection criteria. Moreover, various user-package interfaces are proposed to show how the designer should be guided towards a more realistic design choice. Finally, four different design cases are presented and compared to the output of the classical machine sizing process. The proposed approach serves as a proposal for the next generation of processes implemented with the aid of a high-performance cloud-computing service.
