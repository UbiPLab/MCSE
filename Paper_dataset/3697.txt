AB Data outsourcing has become an important application of cloud computing. Driven by the growing security demands of data outsourcing applications, sensitive data have to be encrypted before outsourcing. Therefore, how to properly encrypt data in a way that the encrypted and remotely stored data can still be queried has become a challenging issue. Searchable encryption scheme is proposed to allow users to search over encrypted data. However, most searchable encryption schemes do not consider search result diversification, resulting in information redundancy. In this paper, a verifiable diversity ranking search scheme over encrypted outsourced data is proposed while preserving privacy in cloud computing, which also supports search results verification. The goal is that the ranked documents concerning diversification instead of reading relevant documents that only deliver redundant information. Extensive experiments on real-world dataset validate our analysis and show that our proposed solution is effective for the diversification of documents and verification.
