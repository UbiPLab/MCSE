AB Sensor networks are evolving from simple applications to integrated infrastructure that can be shared by several applications, an essential characteristic of shared sensor and actuator networks (SSANs). In this context, there is a need to facilitate the use of the SSANs, besides managing and making available the data collected from sensor nodes. Here we present the INOSHARE framework, which provides the best use of existing resources on a shared sensor and actuator network, and enables users to create and supervise their applications remotely. Thus, it facilitates the management of their applications and availability of data that can be performed on cloud computing. We developed a Petri network to validate our proposal, and we also present a case study.
