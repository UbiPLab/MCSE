AB The purpose of this study is to develop a better understanding of the factors motivating individuals who use cloud-based services despite the privacy and security risks associated with it. The authors developed a research model that incorporates the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and constructs from previous research to explain individuals' intentions to use cloud-based services. Our analysis shows support for the relationships among predictor variables (attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and information privacy) and the outcome variable (behavioral intention). Additionally, our analysis shows IT leadership and trust as moderating variables between the TPB predictor variables (attitude and perceived behavioral control), but not subjective norm. The results indicate that IT leadership support of cloud-based systems can have a positive effect on cloud adoption and individuals are likely to continue their use of cloud computing despite the privacy and security risks associated with it.
