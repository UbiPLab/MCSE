AB This paper proposes An Architecture of IPTV Services based on PVR-Micro Data Center and PMIPv6 in Cloud Computing. The proposed architecture addresses important problems exist in normal PMIPv6 (Proxy mobile IPv6) environment which is not today addressed by normal PMIPv6. The first issue is user devices secure authentication, registration and fast handover in both inter-domain/intra-domain of PMIPv6. The second issues is multimedia delivery in inter-domain/intra-domain of PMIPv6. The third issue is tunneling overhead in inter-domain/intra. Today smart devices are mobile and user use them to access the internet from anywhere at any time using different connection method while they are traveling. Providing security measures such as user device authentication, registration as well as hand over requires different security measures and configuration in inter-domain/intra-domain of PMIPv6. Furthermore we provide new method to reduce tunneling overhead by allowing multimedia content to be delivered from many different Micro data center as well as Mega data center by using their own unique addresses to create tunneling to transfer multimedia content. Our goal is not only to reduce authentication delay, handover delay and reduce signaling cost using the intelligent utilization of AAA server (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting Server), binding cache entry (BCE), and proxy notification update (PNU) and proxy notification acknowledgment (PNA) but also to provide fast delivery of multimedia content. Our result shows better performance when compare with normal PMIPv6. We used network simulator 3 (NS3) to generate our experiment result.
