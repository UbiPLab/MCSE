AB In order to solve a series of problems such as the high degree of heterogeneity and the lack of scalability in the traditional vehicle networking due to the increase of the scale of vehicles and the variety of vehicle applications, this study proposes to research and develop an innovative vehicle network; first, by introducing the architecture, technology, and problems encountered in the traditional car networking, the detailed analysis of the cloud and fog-based software-defined vehicles networking is carried out, and the problem of performance optimization of the vehicle's network is discussed and studied to establish a fog server to make it play a coordinating role, so that the central fog servers can complete the load and deliver them to each other, and then load and unload based on the cloud computing service. Finally, based on the technologies of controller and virtualization, the quality of service and the consumption of energy are optimized from the aspects of system and equipment. Based on this, a two-way constrained particle swarm optimization algorithm can be adopted to mitigate these difficulties. Finally, the experiment and simulation analysis of the proposed algorithm shows that the proposed algorithm has the performance advantages and can help improve the communication delay and energy consumption. Therefore, research and discussion on this aspect are of great significance to the development of future vehicle networking technologies.
