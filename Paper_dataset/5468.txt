AB Access management poses a significant challenge within the Internet of Things (IoT) given the constrained capabilities in terms of computing, memory, storage, bandwidth and energy available for most of the low-cost devices and things embedded in the physical world. In this scenario, Edge Computing can be considered a powerful opportunity to solve authorization issues, deploying edge devices near IoT constrained things capable of performing as logical intermediaries or brokers between them and cloud resources, services or applications. This work proposes an edge-centric delegation of authorization for constrained devices (without cryptographic capabilities) based on well-known and extensively used specifications and protocols such as OAuth 2.0 and CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol). The proposed solution is based on three different roles allowing constrained devices automated enrolment, authorized access to resources deployed in the cloud and roaming. Furthermore, the proposed solution is validated and assessed using a real smart farming case study.
