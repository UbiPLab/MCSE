AB The rapid development of cloud storage has caused a wave of research craze. To improve cloud user experience, a large number of schemes are proposed with various practical performances, like long-term correct ensurence and dynamic support. In most works, however, authors seem to completely ignore that data owner alone could not have enough energy to discover and correct all inappropriate data outsourced. Others considered it and gave more than one user both read and write permissions, leading to chaotic management of multiusers. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, where data owner and authenticated assistants form a team to support data dynamics. Assistants are in charge of detecting problems of data and discussing a corresponding modification suggestion, while data owner is responsible for the implementation of the modification. Additionally, our algorithm supports identity authentication, malicious assistant revocation, and lazy update. Sufficient numerical analysis validates the performance of our algorithm.
