AB Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud providers typically offer multiple service classes to satisfy users with different requirements and budgets. Cloud providers are faced with the challenge of estimating the minimum resource capacity required to meet Service Level Objectives (SLOs) defined for all service classes. This paper proposes a capacity planning method that is combined with an admission control mechanism to address this challenge. The capacity planning method uses analytical models to estimate the output of a quota-based admission control mechanism and find the minimum capacity required to meet availability SLOs and admission rate targets for all classes. An evaluation using trace-driven simulations shows that our method estimates the best cloud capacity with a mean relative error of 2.5% with respect to the simulation, compared to a 36% relative error achieved by a single-class baseline method that does not consider admission control mechanisms. Moreover, our method exhibited a high SLO fulfillment for both availability and admission rates, and obtained mean CPU utilization over 91%, while the single-class baseline method had values not greater than 78%. 2017 Elsevier B.V.
