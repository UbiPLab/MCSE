AB Cloud computing has evolved as one of the next generation structural design of the IT endeavors in the recent years. It enables to function like the Internet through the process of accessing and sharing computing resources as virtual resources in a protected and scalable way, thereby obtaining huge influence in corporate data centers. Even as remotely hosted, governed services have long been a component of the IT landscape, an enhanced awareness in cloud computing has been powered by ubiquitous networks, maturing standards, the increase of hardware and software virtualization, and the drive to bring about IT costs flexible and obvious. Several schemes have been provided in cloud computing for enhancing the security, however most of them sustain from leakage of data. This leads to a greater issue while sharing the data in the cloud computing environment. In order to realize the leakage of data in the cloud, we address the construction of an efficient technique, Instance Communication Channel Key Organizer (ICCKO) model to support the security and data confidentiality in a secure manner. We formally prove the data security of ICCKO model based on client and server and analyze its performance and computational complexity. Performance of ICCKO model is evaluated in terms of communication overhead, log creation time, data transfer rate and channel disturbance level for sharing the data securely. Extensive security and performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme is tremendously efficient and provides with provable secure data sharing.
