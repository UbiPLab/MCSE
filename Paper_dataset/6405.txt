AB Intellectualization has become a new trend for telecom industry, driven by intelligent technology including cloud computing, big data, and Internet of things. In order to satisfy the service demand of intelligent logistics, this paper designed an intelligent logistics platform containing the main applications such as e-commerce, self-service transceiver, big data analysis, path location and distribution optimization. The intelligent logistics service platform has been built based on cloud computing to collect, store and handling multi-source heterogeneous mass data from sensors, RFID electronic tag, vehicle terminals and APP, so that the open-access cloud services including distribution, positioning, navigation, scheduling and other data services can be provided for the logistics distribution applications. And then the architecture of intelligent logistics cloud platform containing software layer (SaaS), platform layer (PaaS) and infrastructure (IaaS) has been constructed accordance with the core technology relative high concurrent processing technique, heterogeneous terminal data access, encapsulation and data mining. Therefore, intelligent logistics cloud platform can be carried out by the service mode for implementation to accelerate the construction of the symbiotic win-win logistics ecological system and the benign development of the ICT industry in the trend of intellectualization in China.
