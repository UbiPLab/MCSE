ID HANBURY BROWN; COHERENCE
AB We investigate the position- and momentum-space two-body correlations in a weakly interacting, harmonically trapped atomic Bose-Einstein condensed gas at low temperatures. The two-body correlations are computed within the Bogoliubov approximation and the consequences of the finite system size are highlighted in contrast to the spatially homogeneous case. In the position space, we recover the antibunching induced by the repulsive interatomic interaction in the condensed fraction localized around the trap center and the bunching in the outer thermal cloud. In the momentum space, bunching signatures appear for either equal or opposite values of the momentum and display peculiar features as a function of the momentum and the temperature. In analogy to the optical Hanbury-Brown and Twiss effect, the amplitude of the bunching signal at closeby momenta is fixed by the chaotic nature of the matter field state and its linewidth is shown to be set by the (inverse of the) finite spatial size of the associated in-trap momentum components. In contrast, the linewidth of the bunching signal at opposite momenta is only determined by the condensate size.
