AB Cloud robotics is the application of cloud computing concepts to robotic systems. It utilizes modern cloud computing infrastructure to distribute computing resources and datasets. Cloud-based real-time outsourcing localization architecture is proposed in this paper to allow a ground mobile robot to identify its location relative to a road network map and reference images in the cloud. An update of the road network map is executed in the cloud, as is the extraction of the robot-terrain inclination (RTI) model as well as reference image matching. A particle filter with a network-delay-compensation localization algorithm is executed on the mobile robot based on the local RTI model and the recognized location both of which are sent from the cloud. The proposed methods are tested in different challenging outdoor scenarios with a ground mobile robot equipped with minimal onboard hardware, where the longest trajectory was 13.1 km. Experimental results show that this method could be applicable to large-scale outdoor environments for autonomous robots in real time. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
