AB Indian farming sector is mainly occupied by marginal, small, medium and large landholding farmers. These farmers are working consistently on their own or contract farm for financial sustainability, and to feed themselves and the nation; simultaneously they are also geared up for healthy food access and food production. Though food traceability of agriculture products in India is at the initial stage, many public and private enterprises have taken initiatives to establish the best agro-food produce traceability system in the country. This paper focuses on smart phone and other devices that provide Indian farmers a new identity and an easy platform to access domestic and international market. In addition, this paper presents the way of collecting information through web-based traceability portal from government databases like UIDAI, APEDA, GS1 India, Soil Health, InfoLNet, and AGMARK to mitigate the food fraud vulnerability, consumer health risk hazards, and recall issues. Furthermore, this paper aims to create a compatible one-touch secure remote access, which would give third-party services to consumer, retailer, exporter, and food business, and ultimately it would help the farmers to raise their income (earning) level and provide them the best market valuation through the online cloud-based web portal.
