AB With the development of cloud services, many network fraudulent incidents have damaged the interests of transaction subjects and brought a great crisis to online service. To analyze and solve the key conditions for different participants to achieve mutual trust and win-win situations in the cloud computing, we propose a trust prediction game model composed of the supervisor, cloud service provider (CSP), and user. Firstly, we use the Bayesian formula to predict the behavior trust attribute and propose the trust service map function and weight algorithm by the principle of maximum dispersion. Secondly, based on the perspective of the user, we establish a two-party dynamic game model and discuss the existence possibility of game equilibrium. Thirdly, based on the perspective of CSP, we establish a tripartite game model, analyze several possible equilibria, and obtain the equilibrium strategy from a mixed perspective. Finally, the experimental results show that the supervision has a significant impact on the strategy selection of the players, verify the correctness and effectiveness of various game parameters, exhibition the better advantage than several articles under some different standards, and make a useful exploration for building a secure and trusted cloud service environment.
