AB Geo-based application services linked with the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Web Processing Service (WPS) protocol have been regarded as an important standardized framework for of digital earth building in the web environments. The WPS protocol provides interface standards for analysis functionalities within geo-spatial processing in web-based service systems. Despite its significance, there is few performance tests of WPS applications. The main motivation in this study is to perform the comparative performance test on WPS standards. Test system, which was composed of WPS servers, WPS framework, data management module, geo-based data processing module and client-sided system, was implemented by fully open source stack. In this system, two kinds of geo-based image processing functions such as cloud detection and gradient magnitude computation were applied. The performance test of different server environments of non-WPS, synchronous WPS 1.0 and asynchronous WPS 2.0 was carried out using 100 threads and 400 threads corresponds client users on a web-based application service. As the result, at 100 threads, performance of three environments was within an adjacent range in the average response time to complete the processing of each thread. At 400 threads, the application case of WPS 2.0 showed the distinguished characteristics for higher performance in the response time than the small threads cases. It is thought that WPS 2.0 contributes to settlement of without performance problems such as time delay or thread accumulation.
