AB Internet of Things (IoT) related applications have emerged as an important field for both engineers and researchers, reflecting the magnitude and impact of data-related problems to be solved in contemporary business organizations especially in cloud computing. This paper first provides a functional framework that identifies the acquisition, management, processing and mining areas of IoT big data, and several associated technical modules are defined and described in terms of their key characteristics and capabilities. Then current research in IoT application is analyzed, moreover, the challenges and opportunities associated with IoT big data research are identified. We also report a study of critical IoT application publications and research topics based on related academic and industry publications. Finally, some open issues and some typical examples are given under the proposed IoT-related research framework.
