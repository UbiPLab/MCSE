DE Cloud Computing; Data Encryption; Query Processing over Encrypted Data
AB As cloud computing has become a widespread technology, malicious attackers can obtain the private information of users that has leaked from the service provider in the outsourced databases. To resolve the problem, it is necessary to encrypt the database prior to outsourcing it to the service provider. However, the most existing data encryption schemes cannot process a query without decrypting the encrypted databases. Moreover, because the amount of the data is large, it takes too much time to decrypt all the data. For this, Programmable Order-Preserving Secure Index Scheme (POPIS) was proposed to hide the original data while performing query processing without decryption. However, POPIS is weak to both order matching attacks and data count attacks. To overcome the limitations, we propose a group order-preserving data encryption scheme (GOPES) that can support efficient query processing over the encrypted data. Since GOPES can preserve the order of each data group by generating the signatures of the encrypted data, it can provide a high degree of data privacy protection. Finally, it is shown that GOPES is better than the existing POPIS, with respect to both order matching attacks and data count attacks.
