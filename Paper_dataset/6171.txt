AB Offloading in cloud computing is a way to execute big files in short times due to the available processing resources on core computers. However in some cases it is vital to execute the file locally on the node if the file size is less than a threshold size. There is a trade off in this issue due to the limited power of the node, therefore, in this paper a novel algorithm is proposed where the file size in each case is measured and then a decision is taken to either execute the file on the node or to send the file to be processed in the core cloud. The main reason is to save time of the execution of the file. However, the second and important reason, is to save the limited node energy in some large file, where the power consumption of the node will be very high. The measurement of the file size and the execution time and the power consumption for the local node and the core cloud is measured to represent an input to the execution decision.
