AB With advances in fog and edge computing, various problems such as data processing for large Internet of Things (IoT) systems can be solved in an efficient manner. One such problem for the next generation smart grid (SG) IoT system comprising of millions of smart devices is the data aggregation problem. Traditional data aggregation schemes for SGs incur high computation and communication costs, and in recent years, there have been efforts to leverage fog computing with SGs to overcome these limitations. In this article, a new fog-enabled privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme (FESDA) is proposed. Unlike existing schemes, the proposed scheme is resilient to false data injection attacks by filtering out the inserted values from external attackers. To achieve privacy, a modified version of the Paillier cryptosystem is used to encrypt the consumption data of the smart meter (SM) users. In addition, FESDA is fault-tolerant, which means, the collection of data from other devices will not be affected even if some of the SMs malfunction. We evaluate its performance along with three other competing schemes in terms of aggregation, decryption, and communication costs. The findings demonstrate that FESDA reduces the communication cost by 50%, when compared with the privacy-preserving fog-enabled data aggregation scheme.
