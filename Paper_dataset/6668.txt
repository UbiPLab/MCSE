AB This paper presents preliminary results for the determinants of Cloud Computing (CC) adoption by Tunisian firms. Based on the responses to a face-to-face questionnaire administered to a random sample of 350 Tunisian firms, and using a Logit model, our empirical study provides four preliminary results. Firstly, the adoption of CC depends firm size and firm employees skilled in working with information and communication technologies. Secondly, we find that there is a competition effect. The more that competitors adopt this innovation, the more that the firm adopts it. Thirdly, adoption of CC is pushed by the perceived cost reducing aspect of CC technology. Our study confirms that this cost reducing aspect is important in the case of Tunisia. Fourthly, the main disadvantage of CC is its perceived complexity. CC is a new technology and there is little information on its uses and benefits; most Tunisian firms perceive it to be a complex technology. We also offer some implications for policy and managers.
