AB With the development of big data and network technology, there are more use cases, such as edge computing, that require more secure and efficient multimedia big data transmission. Data compression methods can help achieving many tasks like providing data integrity, protection, as well as efficient transmission. Classical multimedia big data compression relies on methods like the spatial-frequency transformation for compressing with loss. Recent approaches use deep learning to further explore the limit of the data compression methods in communication constrained use cases like the Internet of Things (IoT). In this article, we propose a novel method to significantly enhance the transformation-based compression standards like JPEG by transmitting much fewer data of one image at the sender's end. At the receiver's end, we propose a two-step method by combining the state-of-the-art signal processing based recovery method with a deep residual learning model to recover the original data. Therefore, in the IoT use cases, the sender like edge device can transmit only 60% data of the original JPEG image without any additional calculation steps but the image quality can still be recovered at the receiver's end like cloud servers with peak signal-to-noise ratio over 31 dB.
