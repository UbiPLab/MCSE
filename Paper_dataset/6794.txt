AB The interplay between cloud and fog computing is crucial for the evolution of IoT, but the reach and specification of such interplay is an open problem. Meanwhile, the advances made in managing hyper-distributed infrastructures involving the cloud and the network edge are leading to the convergence of NFV and 5G, supported mainly by ETSI's MANO architecture. This article argues that fog computing will become part of that convergence, and introduces an open and converged architecture based on MANO that offers uniform management of IoT services spanning the continuum from the cloud to the edge. More specifically, we created the first YANG models for fog nodes, for IoT services involving cloud, network, and/or fog, and expanded the concept of "orchestrated assurance" to provision carrier-grade service assurance in IoT. The article also discusses the application of our model in a flagship pilot in the city of Barcelona.
