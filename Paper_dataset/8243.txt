AB In this study we analyze the access to the defendant's information in electronic devices (online and offline). The Spanish Criminal Procedure Act (LECRIM) bases this procedure in two main axes. On the one hand, the need for reasoned consent or judicial authorization, prior or ex post facto in case of emergency (whether it occurs on the occasion of a home registration or independently of this); on the other hand, the distinction as the information contained in an electronic device is accessed directly or through a communication network (cloud computing), regardless of the class or designation of the device or support.
