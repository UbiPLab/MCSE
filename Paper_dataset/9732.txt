DE Virtualization; live migration; delay; bandwidth guarantee
AB The proliferation of cloud services makes virtualization technology more important. One important feature of virtualization is live Virtual Machine (VM) migration. Two main metrics of evaluating a live VM migration mechanism are total migration time and downtime. Most existing literature on live VM migration focus on designing migration mechanisms to shorten the two metrics or making a tradeoff between them. Few of them can be applied to applications with delay requirements, such as a VM backup process that needs to be done in a specific time. This will negatively impact the user experiences and reduce the profit of cloud service providers. Besides, the frequently varied bandwidth required by the widely used pre-copy mechanism is difficult to be provided by current network technologies. In this work, we theoretically analyze how much bandwidth is required to guarantee the total migration time and downtime of a live VM migration, and then propose a novel transport control mechanism to guarantee the computed bandwidth. The experimental results demonstrate that the bandwidth obtained from the proposed reciprocal-based model guarantees the expected total migration time and downtime, and the proposed transport control mechanism ensures that the live VM migration flow obtains the expected bandwidth even if there are background flows.
