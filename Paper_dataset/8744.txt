AB As a new software paradigm, cloud computing provides services dynamically according to user requirements. However, it tends to disclose personal information due to collaborative computing and transparent interactions among software as a service (SaaS) services. We propose a private data disclosure checking method that can be applied to the collaboration interaction process. First, we describe the privacy requirement with ontology and description logic. Second, with dynamic description logic, we validate whether SaaS services are authorized to obtain a user's privacy attributes, to prevent unauthorized services from obtaining their private data. Third, we monitor authorized SaaS services to guarantee privacy requirements. Therefore, we can prevent users' private data from being used and propagated illegally. Finally, we propose privacy disclosure checking algorithms, and demonstrate their correctness and feasibility by experiments.
