ID COMPUTING ADOPTION
AB The desirous benefits of cloud computing such as high return on investment through efficient resource management, high application throughput and on-demand capabilities have resulted in the unprecedented global acceptance of the computing paradigm. However, research on cloud adoption indicates that fewer organisations in the African states are adopting cloud services. Thus, the purview of the paper is to examine the factors responsible for the poor adoption of cloud computing in most African enterprises using Nigeria as a case study. The study focus on the perception of IT and non-IT employees towards cloud computing. Moreover, the paper reviews the literature on cloud adoption in organisations and from scholars to identify the motivating factors of cloud computing. A proposed 3AI model was conceptualised for analysing the processes involved in adopting cloud services. Research finding identifies employee misconception of job loss, cyber threat, privacy issue and data theft as strong delimitative factors.
