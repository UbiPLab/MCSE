ID INTRUSION DETECTION; GAME; FRAMEWORK; STRATEGY
AB Sensor-cloud computing is envisioned as a promising technology that can integrate various services by extending the computational capabilities of physical sensor nodes. It is prone to attack because of special characteristics of physical sensor nodes and virtual sensor-service nodes. Considering the intrusion detection threshold, false alarm probability of the intrusion detection system (IDS), and three different attacked scenarios, we devise a physical IDS (PIDS)-to-gateway and virtual IDS (VIDS)-to-gateway detection model for Sensor-Cloud. We formulate a two-layer gateway-assisted detection and defense decision problem involving multiple IDSs using an evolutionary game in order to optimize the intrusion detection strategy for lowering energy consumption and reducing alarm messages. We derive an evolutionary stable strategy and prove that the proposed mechanism achieves Nash equilibrium, such that each IDS completes cooperatively defense tasks. We propose a game-theoretic approach to achieve an energy-efficient cooperative defense scheme for sensor-cloud computing environments. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism achieves energy-efficient defense and increases security of data in the Sensor-Cloud.
