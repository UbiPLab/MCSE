AB As the demand for cloud computing environment is increasing, new techniques for making cloud computing more environment-friendly are being proposed with an aim to convert traditional cloud computing into green cloud computing. A standout amongst the most imperative complications in cloud computing is streamlining of energy utilization because its importance is increasing rapidly. There are numerous strategies and algorithms used to limit the energy utilization in the cloud. Methods incorporate DVFS, UP-VMC, Utility based MFF, HCT, AVVMC, ACO, and ESWCT. In this survey, a review of energy-aware techniques is presented for making virtual machines more energy efficient in a cloud computing. Working on each technique is briefly explained. A comparative analysis is also given for comparing multiple efficient techniques with respect to performance metrics.
