AB Scheduling a large scale of concurrent jobs is important for managing cloud computing systems. Existing works often use queue-based models to achieve a single goal, which cannot adapt to various applications and changing scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a novel scheduling framework-BGScheduler for concurrent tasks in cloud computing, which flexibly schedules tasks for various optimized goals to deal with changing requirements of applications. First, we use a bipartite graph model to present tasks' requirements and physical resources. Second, we choose fairness, constraints and priority as goals to match requirements and resources with a minimum cost maximum flow algorithm. Third, we propose an incremental optimization method to speed up the procedure of online solving a bipartite graph. Finally, we have implemented BGScheduler, and the experimental results demonstrate that BGScheduler has well flexibility to achieve various scheduling goals in a real scenario, and has decreased the scheduling delay in a simulated scenario.
