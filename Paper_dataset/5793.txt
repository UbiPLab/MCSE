AB With passage of time, technology is rapidly growing. People and daily life processes are highly dependent on internet. The Internet of Things (IoT) is an area of magnificent impact, growth and potential with the advent and rapid growth of smart homes, smart agriculture, smart cities and smart everything. Internet of Things (IoT) construct an environment in which everything is integrated and digitalized. People depend on smart phones and want to do their daily routine tasks in easy and quick way. Ordinary homes consist of multiple digital appliances that are controlled or managed by individual remote systems. It's very hectic to use multiple individual remotes to control various component of homes. In current technological era, rather than home appliances, almost all type of home components available in digital forms. Various home automation systems with different specifications and implementations were proposed in literature. This research objective is to introduce an IoT based approach for efficient home automation system using Arduino and ThingSpeak. We have automated almost all essential aspects of smart home. Proposed system is efficient in terms of low power consumption, green building and increases the life of digital appliances. ThingSpeak cloud platform is used to integrate the home components; analyze and process the data. State of the art MQTT protocol is implemented for LAN communication. This paper will provide a path to IoT developers and researchers to sense, digitalize and control the homes in perspective of future IoT. Moreover, this work is serving as an instance of how life will be easier with the help of IOT applications.
