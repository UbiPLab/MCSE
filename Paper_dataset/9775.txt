AB Distance learning is gradually relocating from Internet-based e-learning platforms to a mobile cloud-based environment. Cloud is a technology which allows the delivery of teaching material, shared learning experience, and exchanges of knowledge with great proficiency. In this paper, we design a mobile cloud-based learning platform adapted to the needs of practice-oriented education, such as teaching of various sports. The platform enables sport students not only to learn skills, but also to view and analyze learning outcomes anytime and anywhere. It is just as easy for teachers because, first, they can share the online learning activities with students and, second, can provide instant assessments of outcomes. The paper explains how the environment can help sport teaching in higher education and how students can use it to improve skills. A specially developed table tennis course employing the cloud environment is the subject for investigating via a questionnaire what students think about it. Their responses, compiled from the questionnaire and follow-up interviews, are statistically analyzed. The results indicate that, overall, experience with the environment agrees with the top four reasons that Jelavic (2014) lists in support of the role of e-learning in sport education and reveals that it is viewed as a fit and useful platform for the purpose.
