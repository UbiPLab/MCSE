AB Cloud resources and their loads possess dynamic characteristics. Current research methods have utilized certain physical indicators and fixed thresholds to evaluate cloud resources, which cannot meet the dynamic needs of cloud resources or accurately reflect their resource states. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a Self-adaptive threshold based Dynamically Weighted load evaluation Method (termed SDWM). It evaluates the load state of the resource through a dynamically weighted evaluation method. First, the work proposes some dynamic evaluation indicators in order to evaluate the resource state more accurately. Second, SDWM divided the resource load into three states, including O v e r l o a d, N o r m a l and I d l e using the self-adaptive threshold. It then migrated those overload resources to a balance load, and releases the idle resources whose idle times exceeded a threshold to save energy, which could effectively improve system utilization. Finally, SDWM leveraged an energy evaluation model to describe energy quantitatively using the migration amount of the resource request. The parameters of the energy model were obtained from a linear regression model according to the actual experimental environment. Experimental results showed that SDWM is superior to other methods in energy conservation, task response time, and resource utilization, and the improvements are 31.5 %, 50 %, 50.8 %, respectively. These results demonstrate the positive effect of the dynamic self-adaptive threshold. More specially, SDWM shows great adaptability when resources dynamically join or exit.
