   GDPR
AB Currently, there are several challenges that cloud-based healthcare systems around the world are facing. The most important issue is to ensure security and privacy, or in other words, to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data. Although the main provisions for data security and privacy were present in the former legal framework for the protection of personal data, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) introduces new concepts and new requirements. In this paper, we present the main changes and the key challenges of the GDPR and, at the same time, we present how a cloud-based security policy could be modified in order to be compliant with the GDPR, as well as how cloud environments can assist developers to build secure and GDPR compliant cloud-based healthcare systems. The major concept of this paper is dual-purpose; primarily, to facilitate cloud providers in comprehending the framework of the new GDPR and secondly, to identify security measures and security policy rules, for the protection of sensitive data in a cloud-based healthcare system, following our risk-based security policy methodology that assesses the associated security risks and takes into account different requirements from patients, hospitals, and various other professional and organizational actors.
