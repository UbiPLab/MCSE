AB Cloud computing, emerged as a commercial service model, has been widely concerned in both industry and academia. Massive workflow applications could be performed simultaneously on the cloud platforms, which significantly benefits from the elasticity and convenience of cloud computing. However, it is still a challenge to schedule virtualized resources for the concurrent workflows in cloud environment, with limited high-performance resources in a timesaving and efficient manner. In view of this challenge, a dynamic scheduling method for concurrent workflows, named as DSM, in cloud environment is proposed to satisfy the various resource requirements of the workflows. Technically, a time overhead model for the workflows and a resource utilization model for cloud datacenter are presented. Then a relevant dynamic scheduling method is designed based on critical path lookup, which aims at minimizing the makespan of workflows, and maximizing the resource utilization of the datacenter during the execution of the workflows. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed method.
