ID GRAPHICAL PASSWORD
AB SDN has provided significant convenience for network providers and operators in cloud computing. Such a great advantage is extending to the Internet of Things network. However, it also increases the risk if the security of an SDN network is compromised. For example, if the network operator's permission is illegally obtained by a hacker, he/she can control the entry of the SDN network. Therefore, an effective authentication scheme is needed to fit various application scenarios with high-security requirements. In this article, we design, implement, and evaluate a new authentication scheme called the hidden pattern (THP), which combines graphics password and digital challenge value to prevent multiple types of authentication attacks at the same time. We examined THP in the perspectives of both security and usability, with a total number of 694 participants in 63 days. Our evaluation shows that THP can provide better performance than the existing schemes in terms of security and usability.
