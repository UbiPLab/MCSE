AB The variety of offerings of online Geographical Information Science (GIS) programs has been extensively reported in the literature, which describes various types of degrees and certificates offered by institutions all over the world. Most online courses have merely focused on delivering lectures, for which standard presentation tools such as PowerPoint are sufficient to fulfil this task. It is imperative for GIS online courses to deliver instruction as a series of interactive steps. This paper presents how an integrated virtual system based on cloud computing can be developed to enhance GIS online courses, and how such an approach provides an interactive teaching method to improve the quality of communication between students and teachers.
