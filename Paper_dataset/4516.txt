AB The digitization of the construction industry is well under way. New technologies and processes are opening various opportunities, and at the same time, the steel construction industry is facing changing requirements and challenges. With a long digital background behind it, steel construction has great potential to help shape these changes and reinvent itself entirely. From the multitude of possibilities, we will focus on five important trends that are shaping the digitization of the industry and influencing the competitiveness of German steel construction: a clear commitment to open data formats, seamless automation of production, assembly and site logistics, decentralized working and cloud computing, as well as the new role of the steel fabricator as BIM (Building Information Modeling) manager.
