AB Electronic health (e-health) information systems rely on cloud computing technologies to provide massive medical data storage services. Particularly, to ensure the confidentiality of diagnostic results, sensitive diagnostic data need to be encrypted before being uploaded to a cloud server. Hence, enabling encrypted diagnostic data sharing efficiently is a demanding issue. To this end, we propose an identity-based authorized searchable encryption scheme (IBASE), without incurring substantial certificate management costs. IBASE enables a doctor to authorize an assistant to handle the tricky encrypted diagnostic data sharing with patients in cloud-assisted e-health information systems, by using identity-based encryption with keyword search, which dramatically alleviates the work intensity of the doctor. As a consequence, any patient could retrieve his/her diagnostic reports in a confidential way, by submitting a trapdoor of the corresponding keyword. We formally prove the security of IBASE, and IBASE resists inside keyword guessing attacks (IKGA), any shared encrypted diagnostic data cannot be leaked to the cloud server. The performance comparison demonstrates that IBASE is practical for mobile cloud-assisted e-health information systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
