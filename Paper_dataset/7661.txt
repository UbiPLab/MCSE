AB The problem ofcloud data retrieval for the periods between the fixed terms ofobservations from geostationary satellites is solved using the differential methods for the optical flow. To solve the problem, the possibility of using different methods for computing cloud motion vectors is investigated. The estimates of the accuracy of computed vectors based on artificially generated test sequences are presented. The test results reveal that the accuracy of the optical flow calculation with the modt fied Brox's method excels the other mentioned methods. The software is implemented for creating the smooth animation of cloud movement using the modified Brox's method.
