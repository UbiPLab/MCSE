AB Cloud computing based on OpenStack is widely used as a distributed computing platform. OpenStack has progressed at a rapid pace, incorporating a variety of service modules; it is supported by many companies, has a community of active developers, and a diverse user base. OpenStack uses message queue to coordinate and exchange operation and status information between services. OpenStack supports various message queue services including RabbitMQ, Qpid, and ZeroMQ, whereas its distribution architecture uses RabbitMQ. As an OpenStack's message queue service, RabbitMQ runs on a controller node as a centralized service. In case of the centralized service, increased usage may cause slowed response times and security vulnerability. This paper proposes a Hybrid decentralized Practical byzantine fault tolerance Blockchain Framework with two-step verification for OpenStack message queue service. When compared to existing OpenStack message queue service, OpenStack with the proposed framework demonstrates identical reliability a faster response time by approximately 46.75% with a two-step verification process and decentralization approach. Additionally, a reduction in the security vulnerability in the OpenStack message queue information with saving the message queue information into each node by blockchain-based decentralized data duplication approach.
