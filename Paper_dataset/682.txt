AB Featured Application Aims to execute novel optimisation algorithms such as whale optimisation and lion optimisation to find the optimal Virtual_Ms on cloud environment as well as executing our model in different applications. Cloud computing has a significant role in healthcare services, especially in medical applications. In cloud computing, the best choice of virtual machines (Virtual_Ms) has an essential role in the quality improvement of cloud computing by minimising the execution time of medical queries from stakeholders and maximising utilisation of medicinal resources. Besides, the best choice of Virtual_Ms assists the stakeholders to reduce the total execution time of medical requests through turnaround time and maximise CPU utilisation and waiting time. For that, this paper introduces an optimisation model for medical applications using two distinct intelligent algorithms: genetic algorithm (GA) and parallel particle swarm optimisation (PPSO). In addition, a set of experiments was conducted to provide a competitive study between those two algorithms regarding the execution time, the data processing speed, and the system efficiency. The PPSO algorithm was implemented using the MATLAB tool. The results showed that the PPSO algorithm gives accurate outcomes better than the GA in terms of the execution time of medical queries and efficiency by 3.02% and 37.7%, respectively. Also, the PPSO algorithm has been implemented on the CloudSim package. The results displayed that the PPSO algorithm gives accurate outcomes better than default CloudSim in terms of final implementation time of medicinal queries by 33.3%. Finally, the proposed model outperformed the state-of-the-art methods in the literature review by a range from 13% to 67%.
