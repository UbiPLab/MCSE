DE survey; E-learning; mobile cloud computing
AB Recently, Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) is emerging as an advanced technology among all the mobile services available and hence the research in MCC is becoming an urgent necessity. This is a simple logic of integration of mobile environment with cloud and so there is a need to overcome the mobile constraints such as power back up, storage unit, heterogeneity, availability as well as bandwidth. In order to match up with these applications, various architectures and frameworks are developed with the view of utilizing cloud on resource constrained devices like mobile. In this paper, a survey is done on application of E-learning under mobile cloud computing environment.
