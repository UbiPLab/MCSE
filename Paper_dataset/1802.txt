AB For the time being, the educational institutions are keen to use e-learning in their educational environment. This, in turn, will support their learning process and allow the learners to access any service or learning material or information at any time they need it. With all the pros by the e-learning, it still suffers from many problems that are explained clearly in this paper. In contrast, along with the innovation of cloud computing technology as a new paradigm in the IT world. With the establishment of cloud computing, numerous services for numerous fields (e.g., education, business, and government) have been introduced that have greatly facilitated the e-learning. In this paper, it demonstrates how the inclusion of the cloud computing paradigm in the e-learning environment assist positively. A lot of obstacles that are introduced by e-learning have been remedied. It combines the cloud computing in the e-learning system, thus, the proposed E-learning Embracing Cloud Computing Model (ELECCM) has completely developed and performed with all the essential components that are needed for their architecture. The study presents all the procedures that are run in order by the proposed system. Then, a fully functional e-learning system based on cloud computing; with low cost and low technical barriers, is demonstrated and explained clearly.
