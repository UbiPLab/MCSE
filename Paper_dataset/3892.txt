AB Fog computing has emerged as a complementary solution to address the issues faced in cloud computing. While fog computing allows us to better handle time/delay-sensitive Internet of Everything (IoE) applications (e.g. smart grids and adversarial environment), there are a number of operational challenges. For example, the resource-constrained nature of fog-nodes and heterogeneity of IoE jobs complicate efforts to schedule tasks efficiently. Thus, to better streamline time/delay-sensitive varied IoE requests, the authors contributes by introducing a smart layer between IoE devices and fog nodes to incorporate an intelligent and adaptive learning based task scheduling technique. Specifically, our approach analyzes the various service type of IoE requests and presents an optimal strategy to allocate the most suitable available fog resource accordingly. We rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed approach using simulation, as well as its correctness using formal verification. The evaluation findings are promising, both in terms of energy consumption and Quality of Service (QoS).
