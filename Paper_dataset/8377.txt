AB Cloud computing technologies have been prospering in recent years and have opened an avenue for a wide variety of forms of adaptable data sharing. Taking advantage of these state-of-the-art innovations, the cloud storage data owner must, however, use a suitable identity-based cryptographic mechanism to ensure the safety prerequisites while sharing data to large numbers of cloud data users with fuzzy identities. As a successful way to guarantee secure fuzzy sharing of cloud data, the identity-based cryptographic technology still faces an effectiveness problem under multireceiver configurations. The chaos theory is considered a reasonable strategy for reducing computational complexity while meeting the cryptographic protocol's security needs. In an identity-based cryptographic protocol, public keys for individual clients are distributed, allowing the clients to separately select their own network identities or names as their public keys. In fact, in a public-key cryptographic protocol, it is for the best that the confirmation of the public key is done in a safe, private manner, because this way the load of storage on the server's side can be considerably relieved. The objective of this paper is to outline and examine a conversion process that can transfer cryptosystems using Chebyshev's chaotic maps over the Galois field to a subtree-based protocol in the cloud computing setting for fuzzy user data sharing, as opposed to reconcocting a different structure. Furthermore, in the design of our conversion process, no adjustment of the original cryptosystem based on chaotic maps is needed.
