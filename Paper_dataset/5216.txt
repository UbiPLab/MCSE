AB Cloud computing is a promising information technique (IT) that can organize a large amount of IT resources in an efficient and flexible manner. Increasingly numerous companies plan to move their local data management systems to the cloud and store and manage their product information on cloud servers. An accompanying challenge is how to protect the security of the commercially confidential data, while maintaining the ability to search the data. In this paper, a privacy-preserving data search scheme is proposed, that can support both the identifier-based and feature-based product searches. Specifically, two novel index trees are constructed and encrypted, that can be searched without knowing the plaintext data. Analysis and simulation results demonstrate the security and efficiency of our scheme.
