AB Ocean big data is distributed, which has the characteristics of integrated application. In the distributed network environment, one must avoid information barriers, which will avoid the repeated construction of ocean big data service technology. Therefore, based on the construction of marine information infrastructure and demand orientation, the relationship between marine data sharing and information services can be demonstrated. Through the construction of the framework of ocean big data platform, this article develops ocean big data under the distributed network environment, which is very helpful for the application of ocean data. Through diversified ocean big data, this article establishes an efficient distributed computing ocean big data cloud platform, which is an important development direction of intelligent ocean construction. Through technical support, massive data resources can be used, which will tap the potential value of ocean data.
