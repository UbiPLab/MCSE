AB We numerically simulate gravity-assisted loading of laser-cooled atoms into a hollow-core fiber. For this, we compute the trajectories of falling atoms and test the success or failure of loading with a range of atoms' initial positions and velocities. By overlapping these results with the position and velocity distribution of the trapped atomic cloud, the number of loaded atoms is estimated without a random sampling process. We present our predictions for the atomic cloud's loading efficiency into a photonic-bandgap fiber with a 7.5 mu m-diameter hollow core for various experimental conditions, such as the initial temperature, the cloud position and size, and the dipole trap power, and compare the predictions to experimental data. Our approach reduces the computational resources and time compared to the Monte-Carlo approach used in previously reported works.
