   SHUFFLED FROG LEAPING ALGORITHM (SFLA)
AB A memetic meta-heuristic based shuffled frog-leaping algorithm (SFLA) has mainly developed to solve combinatorial optimization problems. The main objective of proposed approach parameters are CPU Utilization Rate and Memory Rate. Cloud maintaining large numbers of applications, at a time but some limitation have load balancing of data and hosting of cloud data centers, occurs large network latency. Newly introduced Fog computing is located at network edge in cloud environment. Using SFLA algorithm to solve load balancing problem in a Fog based cloud computing. Based on the computational results benchmark problems are compared with existing algorithms demonstrate the proposed SFLA algorithm effectiveness.
