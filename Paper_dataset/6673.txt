AB End-to-End delay is an important performance metric to evaluate the performance of many Internet multimedia applications such as, Voice Over IP (VOIP), online gaming, cloud computing etc. Especially, the delays at some bottleneck-links of a path account for a large proportion of the End-to-End delay. To accurately identify the delays at bottleneck-links is a fundamental approach to study the delay feature of Internet, and is beneficial to the design of some efficient distributed algorithms. In this paper, we utilize real measured probing data to conduct a statistical analysis of the relationship between one-way delay and bottleneck-delay, and demonstrate that bottleneck-delay appears in 70 % of the paths in Internet. In order to further study the features of bottleneck-delay, we propose an IP united mapping scheme which combines the IP centralized mapping with the IP geographic mapping. Experiment results show that two ends of a bottleneck-link are usually located in the same country, and the links with a large number of entrances (in-degrees) and few number of exits (out-degrees) or the average shallower links are prone to leading to bottleneck-delays. Based on the structural properties of the bottleneck-links, we also give a deep discussion about the factors of bottleneck-delays at last, which demonstrates queuing delay is a key factor of bottleneck-delay.
