AB In 5G networks, the spectrum allocation techniques play a very important part of the quality of content delivery services. The processes of channelling and device selection are important in the 5G technology and beyond with many access devices in networks to improve the quality of services. In this paper, we propose a method based on Fuzzy Logic, Game Theory, and Smart Method (which is a combination of Fuzzy Logic and Game Theory). These methods are suitable to improve the speed and quality of links of data routing in networks. The paper shows that effective spectrum allocation to devices is not an option but a requirement in a huge data flow environment of the wireless communications, if one wants to ensure acceptable speed and quality of the connection and to provide adequate quality of the services. Each of the selected methods for radio resource management has some advantages and disadvantages in the evaluation of results. The paper describes the process of channel allocation with different methods for IEEE 802.11xx networks that are in the focus of our research in the sphere of wireless communication. Companies use cloud computing to provide services and to share information, but there needs to be some radio resource management to effectively use the services in the wireless mobile environment because the number of different types of devices being connected to the wireless networks to create smart homes and smart cities is growing.
