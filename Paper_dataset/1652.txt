AB Cloud Computing has become the dominant technology to offer unlimited computing for various social and commercial applications. Cloud computing is also being adopted at the rapid pace for e-Learning. This paper has illustrated upon the phenomenon of Cloud based e-Learning adoption in the institutes of universities and institutes of higher education. Critical success factors for the effective implementing of Cloud Based e-Learning have been identified through systematic literature review using framework of Denyer and Tranfield (2009). Further they are clustered into four dimensions namely cloud service resilience, university technological maturity, university organizational readiness and Cloud Based e-Learning imperatives. The results of this research will be helpful for policymakers and practitioners of e-Learning in implementing Cloud Based e-Learning Platform.
