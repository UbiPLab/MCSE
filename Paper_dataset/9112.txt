AB With the development of cloud computing technology, more and more users have outsourced their data to cloud platform. To protect the safety of these data, some encryption methods are usually used. But it is very difficult question that how to effective retrieval and to use the encrypted data, we propose a multi-attribute keyword retrieval mechanism for encrypted cloud data. In this mechanism, we first define the local feature attributes of the keywords and the global feature attributes of the document. Then, we construct the mapping relationship between keywords and document attributes according to the basic principle of inverted index algorithm and establish the security index. Based on the above steps, we improve the weight of the key words and calculate the similarity score of the document by combining the multi-attribute score function. Experiments show that this mechanism not only can effectively improve the accuracy of the data retrieval, but also can greatly reduce the bandwidth consumption of system.
