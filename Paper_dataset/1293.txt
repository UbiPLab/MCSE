AB The study is to propose the structural equation model for sustainability in higher education about the use of cloud learning based on the technology acceptance model. Also, this well-known implemented-model was developed by Davis et al.'s technology acceptance model (TAM). The researchers instituted the hypothesized internal hierarchy among content quality, cloud computing, and social cloud for sustainability usage. The informed hypothesis was obtained from a scientific method known as the systematic literature review. After that, the higher education institute in Thailand has given attention to the burgeoning of cloud learning due to the additional demand in line with technology development for tertiary instruction in the country.
   Nevertheless, the strength of its usage is not very outstanding, and there is a need to understand the student's attitude on the sustainability usage of cloud learning from the perspectives of the technology acceptance model. This study indicated that sustainability usage was a significant predictor towards student to use cloud learning. As a result, it is seen that pupils' attitude plays a vital role in contributing to the sustainability to use cloud learning. The consequence of this study is expected to improve and upgraded cloud learning to be beneficial according to the needs of the students.
