AB Outsourcing jobs to a public cloud is a cost-effective way to address the problem of satisfying the peak resource demand when the local cloud has insufficient resources. In this paper, we studied the management of deadline-constrained bag-of-tasks jobs on hybrid clouds. We presented a binary nonlinear programming (BNP) problem to model the hybrid cloud management which minimizes rent cost from the public cloud while completes the jobs within their respective deadlines. To solve this BNP problem in polynomial time, we proposed a heuristic algorithm. The main idea is assigning the task closest to its deadline to current core until the core cannot finish any task within its deadline. When there is no available core, the algorithm adds an available physical machine (PM) with most capacity or rents a new virtual machine (VM) with highest cost-performance ratio. As there may be a workload imbalance between/among cores on a PM/VM after task assigning, we propose a task reassigning algorithm to balance them. Extensive experimental results show that our heuristic algorithm saves 16.2%-76% rent cost and improves 47.3%-182.8% resource utilizations satisfying deadline constraints, compared with first fit decreasing algorithm, and that our task reassigning algorithm improves the makespan of tasks up to 47.6%.
