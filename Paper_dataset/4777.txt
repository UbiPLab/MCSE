AB The development of intelligent traffic systems can benefit from the pervasiveness of IoT technologies. In recent years, increasing numbers of devices are connected to the IoT, and new kinds of heterogeneous data sources have been generated. This leads to traffic systems that exist in extended dimensions of data space. Although cloud computing can provide essential services that reduce the computational load on IoT devices, it has its limitations: high network bandwidth consumption, high latency, and high privacy risks. To alleviate these problems, edge computing has emerged to reduce the computational load for achieving TDaaS in a dynamic way. However, how to drive all edge servers' work and meet data service requirements is still a key issue. To address this challenge, this article proposes a novel three-level transparency-of-traffic-data service framework, that is, a KID-driven TEC computing paradigm. Its aim is to enable edge servers to cooperatively work with a cloud server. A case study is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed new computing paradigm with associated mechanisms. The performance of the proposed system is also compared to other methods.
