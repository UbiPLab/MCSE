ID PUBLIC-KEY ENCRYPTION; CREDENTIALS; SECURE
AB For a smart healthcare system, a cloud based paradigm with numerous user terminals is to support and improve more reliable, convenient, and intelligent services. Considering the resource limitation of terminals and communication overhead in cloud paradigm, we propose a hybrid IoT-Fog-Cloud framework. In this framework, we deploy a geo-distributed fog layer at the edge of networks. The fogs can provide the local storage, sufficient processing power, and appropriate network functions. For the fog-based healthcare system, data confidentiality, access control, and secure searching over ciphertext are the key issues in sensitive data. Furthermore, how to adjust the storage and computing requirements to meet the limited resource is also a great challenge for data management. To address these, we design a lightweight keyword searchable encryption scheme with fine-grained access control for our proposed healthcare related IoT-Fog-Cloud framework. Through our design, the users can achieve a fast and efficient service by delegating a majority part of the workloads and storage requirements to fogs and the cloud without extra privacy leakage. We prove our scheme satisfies the security requirements and demonstrate the excellent efficiency through experimental evaluation.
