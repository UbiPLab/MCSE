AB Fog computing is an encouraging technology in the coming generation to pipeline the breach between cloud data centers and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Fog computing is not a counterfeit for cloud computing but a persuasive counterpart. It also accredits by utilizing the edge of the network while still rendering the possibility to interact with the cloud. Nevertheless, the features of fog computing are encountering novel security challenges. The security of end users and/or fog nodes brings a major dilemma in the implementation of real life scenario. Although there are several works investigated in the security challenges, physical layer security (PLS) in fog computing is not investigated in the above. The distinctive and evolving IoT applications necessitate new security regulations, models, and evaluations disseminated at the network edge. Notwithstanding, the achievement of the current cryptographic solutions in the customary way, many aspects, i.e., system imperfections, hacking skills, and augmented attack, has upheld the inexorableness of the detection techniques. Hence, we investigate PLS that exploits the properties of channel between end user and fog node to detect the impersonation attack in fog computing network. Moreover, it is also challenging to achieve the accurate channel constraints between end user and fog node. Therefore, we propose Q-learning algorithm to attain the optimum value of test threshold in the impersonation attack. The performance of the propose scheme validates and guarantees to detect the impersonation attack accurately in fog computing networks.
