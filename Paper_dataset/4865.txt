AB To explore the wireless sensor network (WSN) structure, the cooperative WSN architecture of mass data processing based on cloud computing is studied. The technology of WSN and cloud computing is deeply discussed. The system and node structure of WSN are studied by theoretical analysis method, and the performance of the WSN is studied by using the numerical simulation method. The mass data processing technology based on Map Reduce and its application in WSN are discussed. The numerical simulation method is used to experiment on the architecture of SVC4WSN and MD4LWSN. The relationship between the optimal network number and the node communication radius at different node density is verified. Moreover, the energy and time delay Reduce path is compared with three protocols of LEACH, PEGASIS and PEDAP. The results show that the two Reduce paths have better performance in both network survival time and the total time slot of data acquisition.
