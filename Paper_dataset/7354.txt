AB Ciphertext Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) is a well-known access control technique, where the data content shared by a single user is accessed by several authorized entities with distinct data access rights, which forms the basis of the point to multi-point communication systems. In such type of systems, the process of user attributes management and user access policy specifications are found to be the challenging tasks. This work introduces an enhanced CP-ABE based access control algorithm, which extracts meaningful user attributes from a set of the user given attributes and stores it over a separate database system. Based upon the extracted attributes, a complete user attribute hierarchical access structure is framed. The user access is provided only when the user attributes hierarchical access structure satisfies the user access policy defined by the data owner. In this manner, the proposed system better solves the drawbacks of existing systems. Experiments show that our proposed algorithm provides comparatively efficient user access than existing CP-ABE techniques and it has lesser computational complexity.
