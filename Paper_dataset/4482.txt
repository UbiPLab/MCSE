AB The survey shows that most of the potential cloud users worry about the trustworthiness problem of cloud computing service, and this problem has become one of the most important reasons to hinder development of cloud computing. Therefore, it is very necessary to measure and evaluate the trustworthy degree of cloud service provider (CSP). In consideration of lacking the trustworthiness evaluation and measurement studies for CSP, besides this, a few research results have not considered uncertainty and relevance among trustworthiness factors in the measuring process. So, this paper summarizes factors affecting cloud service trustworthiness in terms of six aspects: controllability, visualization, security, reliability, provider viability and user satisfaction, constructs the trustworthy cloud service attribute model, based on this model, proposes to use the Information Entropy and Markov Chain as the trustworthiness evaluation method to establish a model and proves the scientificity and rationality of this method, as well as verifies the feasibility through case analysis.
