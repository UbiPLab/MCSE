AB The scheduling of load balanced transactions is an emerging problem in on-demand computing system. This problem can be studied considering several parameters such as resource availability, performance, and reliability. The existing approaches to find the exact solutions for this problem are limited. This paper presents a Honey Bee Optimization (HBO)-based method to solve the mentioned problem. In this method, first, the load of the system is balanced and then the transactions are scheduled using foraging behavior of honey bees to find the optimal solutions. We also modify four known scheduling algorithms such as Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Hierarchical Load Balanced Algorithm (HLBA), Dynamic and Decentralized Load Balancing (DLB), and Randomized to obtain transaction scheduling algorithms for the purpose of comparison with our proposed algorithm. The compared results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than the modified existing algorithms.
