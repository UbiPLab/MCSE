AB Numerical simulation of the motion and deformation of a tumor embedded into the liver during respiration can help locate a tumor for radiotherapy. Here, a 3D Finite Element (FE) model is presented to simulate the behavior of the human liver during respiration. First, the point cloud data according to Computed Tomography (CT) image data was imported into CATIA software. Then, a spherical tumor was embedded into different segments of liver tissue in ABAQUS. A quasi-linear hyper-viscoelastic constitutive model and elastic behavior were considered to define the liver and tumor properties, respectively. Boundary conditions were defined based on the difference between end-exhale and end-inhale states of liver tissue. The deformation and motion of the liver tumor were then determined in the intermediate states of breathing. Finally, the new position and the deformed shape of the tumor were investigated, considering the increase of tumor stiffness. The results showed that the tumor located in the segment VII experienced maximum displacement in the y-direction. Similarly, maximum z-displacement was observed for the tumor embedded into segment VI, while the tumor embedded into segments II and V experienced maximum displacement in the x-direction. Moreover, the maximum motion took place for the tumor in segment VI. (C) 2020 Sharif University of Technology. All rights reserved.
