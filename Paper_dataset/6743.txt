AB Mobile edge computing has risen as a promising technology for augmenting the computational capabilities of mobile devices. Meanwhile, in-network caching has become a natural trend of the solution of handling exponentially increasing Internet traffic. The important issues in these two networking paradigms are computation offloading and content caching strategies, respectively. In order to jointly tackle these issues in wireless cellular networks with mobile edge computing, we formulate the computation offloading decision, resource allocation and content caching strategy as an optimization problem, considering the total revenue of the network. Furthermore, we transform the original problem into a convex problem and then decompose it in order to solve it in a distributed and efficient way. Finally, with recent advances in distributed convex optimization, we develop an alternating direction method of multipliers-based algorithm to solve the optimization problem. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by simulation results with different system parameters.
