AB RFID and Cloud computing are widely used in the IoT (Internet of Things). However, there are few research works which combine RFID ownership transfer schemes with Cloud computing. Subsequently, this paper points out the weaknesses in two protocols proposed by Xie et al. (2013) [3] and Doss et al. (2013) [9]. To solve the security issues of these protocols, we present a provably secure RFID ownership transfer protocol which achieves the security and privacy requirements for cloud-based applications. To be more specific, the communication channels among the tags, mobile readers and the cloud database are insecure. Besides, an encrypted hash table is used in the cloud database. Next, the presented protocol not only meets backward untraceability and the proposed strong forward untraceability, but also resists against replay attacks, tracing attacks, inner reader malicious impersonation attacks, tag impersonation attacks and desynchronization attacks. The comparisons of security and performance properties show that the proposed protocol has more security, higher efficiency and better scalability compared with other schemes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.
