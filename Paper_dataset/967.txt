AB Recently, the variety of cloud technologies and applications has been increasing significantly. With the popularity of cloud applications, the number of business and personal needs is also increasing rapidly. Meanwhile, the industrial development process with cloud technology costs so much that performance will be essential in employing the cloud infrastructure in a large-scale environment. In this paper, OpenStack is first implemented as a heterogeneous cloud storage environment to increase the availability and efficiency of the cloud system. Secondly, Ceph, HDFS, and Swift as a storage service are integrated into the environment based on a proportion-based file distribution mechanism. In this case, the sub-files are distributed to different storage services. Additionally, a user-friendly web interface is developed for the administrator and regular users. Finally, the performance analysis is presented to evaluate the proposed system.
