AB With the increasing adoption of cloud computing, a growing number of users outsource their datasets to cloud. To preserve privacy, the datasets are usually encrypted before outsourcing. However, the common practice of encryption makes the effective utilization of the data difficult. For example, it is difficult to search the given keywords in encrypted datasets. Many schemes are proposed to make encrypted data searchable based on keywords. However, keyword-based search schemes ignore the semantic representation information of users' retrieval, and cannot completely meet with users search intention. Therefore, how to design a content-based search scheme and make semantic search more effective and context-aware is a difficult challenge. In this paper, we propose ECSED, a novel semantic search scheme based on the concept hierarchy and the semantic relationship between concepts in the encrypted datasets. ECSED uses two cloud servers. One is used to store the outsourced datasets and return the ranked results to data users. The other one is used to compute the similarity scores between the documents and the query and send the scores to the first server. To further improve the search efficiency, we utilize a tree-based index structure to organize all the document index vectors. We employ the multi-keyword ranked search over encrypted cloud data as our basic frame to propose two secure schemes. The experiment results based on the real world datasets show that the scheme is more efficient than previous schemes. We also prove that our schemes are secure under the known ciphertext model and the known background model.
