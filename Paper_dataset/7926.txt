AB The expected stringent requirements of future 5G networks such as ultra-low latency, user experience continuity, and high reliability will drive the need for highly localized services within RANs in close proximity to mobile subscribers. In light of this, the mobile edge computing (MEC) concept has emerged, which aims to unite telco, IT, and cloud computing to deliver cloud services directly from the network edge. To facilitate better understanding of MEC, this article first discusses its potential service scenarios and identifies design challenges of MEC-enabled networks. Given the importance of scaling up research in the area of network integration and convergence in support of MEC toward 5G, the article explores the possibilities of empowering integrated fiber-wireless (FiWi) access networks to offer MEC capabilities. More specifically, envisioned design scenarios of MEC over FiWi networks for typical RAN technologies (i.e., WLAN, 4G LTE, ETE-A l letNets) are investigated, accounting for both network architecture and enhanced resource management. The performance of MEC over Ethernet-based FiWi networks in terms of delay, response time efficiency, and battery life of edge devices is then analyzed. The obtained results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed MEC over FiWi concept.
