AB The virtualized resource allocation (mapping) algorithm is the core issue of network virtualization technology. Universal and excellent resource allocation algorithms not only provide efficient and reliable network resources sharing for systems and users, but also simplify the complexity of resource scheduling and management, improve the utilization of basic resources, balance network load and optimize network performance. Based on the application of wireless sensor network, this paper proposes a wireless sensor network architecture based on cloud computing. The WSN hardware resources are mapped into resources in cloud computing through virtualization technology, and the resource allocation strategy of the network architecture is proposed. The experiment evaluates the performance of the resource allocation strategy. The proposed heuristic algorithm is a distributed algorithm. The complexity of centralized algorithms is high, distributed algorithms can handle problems in parallel, and reduce the time required to get a good solution with limited traffic.
