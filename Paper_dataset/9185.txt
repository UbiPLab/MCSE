AB This paper presents a nature-inspired service composition framework for mobile cloud media services, which attempts to solve the mismatch between resource-hungry rich media content and power-limited smart phones used by healthcare professionals. Our objective was to design and develop on-demand and optimal media service composition schemes (combining various individual services such as media streaming services, transcoding services, and payment services). The technique considers the users' quality of service (QoS) requirements and is self-optimizing, self-healing, self-configuring, and self-protecting on a mobile media cloud platform. Media cloud services provide similar functionality but different QoS and can dynamically join or leave the cloud. We propose an approach for choosing an optimal service composition path is to formulate an optimization problem that considers the QoS criteria, and then solve the problem using a nature-inspired technique such as the bee-based algorithm. We evaluated the suitability of this framework through simulations and a test-bed.
