AB At present, cloud computing technology has developed rapidly, which has gradually integrated into the IoT (Internet of things) data mining technology and formed a new model. Based on this, the construction of IoT data mining mode is studied based on cloud computing technology. As an example, a new data mining model is designed. An optimization and update scheme is proposed from the algorithm flow and evaluation model. By effectively evaluating the state of the data mining model, an effective evaluation model is established, and the corresponding evaluation results are given. The structure of the IoT cloud platform is first designed, and then the database module of the information sharing platform is designed, the web interface of the IoT cloud platform is standardized, and finally the mode is tested. The application of the platform is tested to test the accuracy of the data so that it can accurately obtain information.
