AB Cloud computing is one of the great tasks in the business world nowadays, which provides shared processing resources. In cloud area network, security is the main challenge faced by cloud providers and their customers. The advantage of cloud computing includes reduced cost, re-provisioning of resources etc. The cloud network makes use of standard encryption method to secure documents while storing in online. In this paper, we have depicted two efficient encryption algorithms that meet security demand in cloud. Probabilistic encryption, one of these algorithms may be used to produce randomness of text encryption. With this algorithm, if the same message is encrypted twice it should yield different secret coded texts on both calculations. Another crucial algorithm is homomorphic encryption, is a cryptographic method to define the sample system and to provide a software implementation. In order to maintain quality of service (QoS) and improve customer satisfaction, we are going to propose an efficient algorithm which combines the characteristics of both probabilistic and homomorphic encryption techniques, to provide high level of security. Our proposed scheme will yield better encryption techniques reduce security attacks, increased throughput and improve the QoS.
