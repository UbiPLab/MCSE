AB Three-dimensional feature descriptors are heavily employed in various 3-D perception applications to find keypoint correspondences between two point clouds. The availability of mobile devices equipped with depth sensors compels the developed applications to be both memory and computationally efficient. Toward this, in this letter, we present 3DHoPD, a new low-dimensional 3-D feature descriptor that is extremely fast to compute. The novelty lies in compactly encoding the "3-D" keypoint position by transforming it to a new 3-D space, where the keypoints arising from similar 3-D surface patches lie close to each other. Then, we propose histograms of point distributions (HoPD) to capture the neighborhood structure, thus forming 3DHoPD (3D+HoPD). We propose a tailored feature descriptor matching technique, wherein the "3-D" keypoint position in the new 3-D space is used to remove false positive matches, effectively reducing the search space by 90%, and then, the exact match is found using the "HoPD" descriptor. Experimental evaluation on multiple publicly available datasets shows that 3DHoPD is robust to noise and offers stable and competitive keypoint matching performance to the existing state-of-the-art 3-D descriptors with similar dimensionality across datasets, while requiring dramatically low-computational time (10x faster).
