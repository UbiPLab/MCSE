AB SSL/TLS validations such as certificate and public key pinning can reinforce the security of encrypted communications between Internet-of-Things devices and remote servers, and ensure the privacy of users. However, such implementations complicate forensic analysis and detection of information disclosure; say, when a mobile app breaches user's privacy by sending sensitive information to third parties. Therefore, it is crucial to develop the capacity to vet mobile apps augmenting the security of SSL/TLS traffic. In this paper, we propose a technique to bypass the system's default certificate validation as well as built-in SSL/TLS validations performed in iOS apps. We then demonstrate its utility by analysing 40 popular iOS social networking, electronic payment, banking, and cloud computing apps. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
