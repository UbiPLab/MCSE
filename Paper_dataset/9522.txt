AB Virtualization is critical to cloud computing and is possible through hypervisors, which maps the Virtual machines((VMs) to physical resources but poses security concerns as users relinquish physical possession of their computation and data. Good amount of research is initiated for resource provisioning on hypervisors, still many issues need to be addressed for security demanding and real time VMs. First work SRT-CreditScheduler (Secured and Real-time), maximizes the success rate by dynamically prioritizing the urgency and the workload of VMs but ensures highest security for all. Another work, SA-RT-CreditScheduler (Security-aware and Real-time) is a dual objective scheduler, which maximizes the success rate of VMs in best possible security range as specified by the VM owner. Though the algorithms can be used by any hypervisor, for the current work they have been implemented on Xen hypervisor. Their effectiveness is validated by comparing it with Xen's, Credit and SEDF scheduler, for security demanding tasks with stringent deadline constraints.
