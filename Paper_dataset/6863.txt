AB With the rise of cloud computing, thousands of users and multiple applications have sought to communicate with each other, exchanging sensitive data. Thus, for effectively managing applications and resources, the use of models and tools is essential for the secure management of identities and to avoid compromising data privacy. There are models and tools that address federated identity management, and it is important that they use privacy mechanisms to assist in compliance with current legislation. Therefore, this article aims to present a survey of privacy in cloud identity management, presenting and comparing main features and challenges described in the literature. At the end of this work there is a discussion of the use of privacy and future research directions. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
