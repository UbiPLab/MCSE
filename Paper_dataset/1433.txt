AB Recently, reversible data hiding in encrypted image (RDHEI) has attracted extensive attention, which can be used in secure cloud computing and privacy protection effectively. In this paper, a novel RDHEI scheme based on block classification and permutation is proposed. Content owner first divides original image into non-overlapping blocks and then set a threshold to classify these blocks into smooth and non-smooth blocks respectively. After block classification, content owner utilizes a specific encryption method, including stream cipher encryption and block permutation to protect image content securely. For the encrypted image, data hider embeds additional secret information in the most significant bits (MSB) of the encrypted pixels in smooth blocks and the final marked image can be obtained. At the receiver side, secret data will be extracted correctly with data-hiding key. When receiver only has encryption key, after stream cipher decryption, block scrambling decryption and MSB error prediction with threshold, decrypted image will be achieved. When data hiding key and encryption key are both obtained, receiver can find the smooth and non-smooth blocks correctly and MSB in smooth blocks will be predicted correctly, hence, receiver can recover marked image losslessly. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can achieve better rate-distortion performance than some of state-of-the-art schemes.
