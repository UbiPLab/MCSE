DE Cloud computing; workload generator; cluster computing
AB Cloud computing has currently permeated all walks of life. It has proven extremely useful for organizations and individual users to save costs by leasing compute resources that they need. This has led to an exponential growth in cloud computing based research and development. A substantial number of frameworks, approaches and techniques are being proposed to enhance various aspects of clouds, and add new features. One of the constant concerns in this scenario is creating a testbed that successfully reflects a real-world cloud datacenter. It is vital to simulate realistic, repeatable, standardized CPU and memory workloads to compare and evaluate the impact of the different approaches in a cloud environment. This paper introduces Cloudy, which is an open-source workload generator that can be used within cloud instances, Virtual Machines (VM), containers, or local hosts. Cloudy utilizes resource usage traces of machines from Google and Alibaba clusters to simulate up to 16000 different, real-world CPU and memory load patterns. The tool also provides a variety of machine metrics for each run, that can be used to evaluate and compare the performance of the VM, container or host. Additionally, it includes a web-based visualization component that offers a number of realtime statistics, as well as overall statistics of the workload such as seasonal trends, and autocorrelation. These statistics can be used to further analyze the real-world traces, and enhance the understanding of workloads in the cloud.
