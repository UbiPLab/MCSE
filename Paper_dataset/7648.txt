AB Electrical safety monitoring System (ESMS) is a critical component in modern power systems, which is characterized by large-scale access points, massive users and versatile requirements. For convenience of the information integration and analysis, the software development, maintenance, and application in the system, the cloud platform based ESMS is established and assessed in this paper. Firstly the framework of the system is proposed, and then the assessment scheme with a set of evaluation indices are presented, by which the appropriate cloud product can be chosen to meet the requirements of a specific application. Moreover, to calculate the weights of the evaluation indices under uncertainty, an improved interval AHP method is adopted to take into consideration of the fuzziness of expert scoring, the qualitative consistency test, and the two normalizations in the process of eigenvectors. Case studies have been made to verify the feasibility of the assessment approach for ESMS.
