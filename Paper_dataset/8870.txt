AB In recent years, the increase in commercial traffic, specifically in food industry, has a negative impact on the cost of logistics and environment. In other words, it has also an increased risk on quality, safety and food traceability. The development of traceability systems permits to reduce logistical risks in the food supply chains, given that identification, tracking and real-time monitoring in supply chains were always difficult tasks due to the heterogeneity of platforms and technologies. The advent of Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing has brought new approaches to collect, transfer, store and share information through improved cooperation and interoperability between logistics actors. In this work, an approach is proposed for the development of a food traceability system based on IoT technologies, cloud and fog computing to collect information and record events related to products anywhere in the supply chain. The goal is to satisfy users' requests in terms of condition, quality, and position of their products. Finally, a case study for a food contamination scenario is presented to illustrate the usefulness of our approach.
