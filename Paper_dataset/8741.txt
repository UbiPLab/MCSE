AB The article describes how the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method can be used to calculate the volume of anthropogenic microtopography. In the proposed work-flow, data is obtained using mass-market devices such as a compact camera (Canon G9) and a smartphone (iPhone5). The volume is computed using free open source software (VisualSFMv0.5.23, CMPMVSv0.6.0., MeshLab) on a PC-class computer. The input data is acquired from video frames. To verify the method laboratory tests on the embankment of a known volume has been carried out. Models of the test embankment were built using two independent measurements made with those two devices. No significant differences were found between the models in a comparative analysis. The volumes of the models differed from the actual volume just by 0.7% and 2%. After a successful laboratory verification, field measurements were carried out in the same way. While building the model from the data acquired with a smartphone, it was observed that a series of frames, approximately 14% of all the frames, was rejected. The missing frames caused the point cloud to be less dense in the place where they had been rejected. This affected the model's volume differed from the volume acquired with a camera by 7%. In order to improve the homogeneity, the frame extraction frequency was increased in the place where frames have been previously missing. A uniform model was thereby obtained with point cloud density evenly distributed. There was a 1.5% difference between the embankment's volume and the volume calculated from the camera-recorded video. The presented method permits the number of input frames to be increased and the model's accuracy to be enhanced without making an additional measurement, which may not be possible in the case of temporary features.
