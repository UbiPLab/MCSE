AB Cloudlet provides services with low latency and high bandwidth. Some research addresses the resource allocation problem in the cloudlet-based mobile cloud computing environment. However, there are few works considering how to optimize resource allocation while satisfying users' requirements in multicloudlet situations. To solve this problem, a two-stage optimization strategy is proposed. First, a cloudlet selection model based on mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is proposed to obtain the cloudlet for mobile users by optimizing latency and mean reward. Second, a resource allocation model based on MILP is presented to allocate resources in the selected cloudlet by optimizing reward and mean resource usage. A comparison of resource allocation is analyzed with a cloudlet selection model based on MILP and an existing cloudlet selection strategy in the multi-cloudlet environment. From the simulation, our proposed strategy has better performance in terms of the access latency, the system reward and the resource usage.
