ID REDACTABLE SIGNATURES
AB Data authentication primarily serves as a tool to achieve data integrity and source authentication. However, traditional data authentication does not fit well where an intermediate entity (editor) is required to modify the authenticated data provided by the source/data owner before sending the data to other recipients. To ask the data owner for authenticating each modified data can lead to higher communication overhead. In this article, we introduce the notion of editing-enabled signatures where the data owner can choose any set of modification operations applicable on the data and still can restrict any possibly untrusted editor to authenticate the data modified using an operation from this set only. Moreover, the editor does not need to interact with the data owner in order to authenticate the data every time it is modified. We construct an editing-enabled signature (EES) scheme that derives its efficiency from mostly lightweight cryptographic primitives. We formalize the security model for editing-enabled signatures and analyze the security of our EES scheme. Editing-enabled signatures can find numerous applications that involve generic editing tasks and privacy-preserving operations. We demonstrate how our EES scheme can be applied in two privacy-preserving applications.
