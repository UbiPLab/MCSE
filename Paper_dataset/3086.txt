AB Attribute-based encryption can be used to realize fine-grained data sharing in open networks. However, in practical applications, we have to address further challenging issues, such as attribute revocation and data search. How do data users search for the data they need in massive amounts of data? When users leave the system, they lose the right to decrypt the shared data. In this case, how do we ensure that revoked users cannot decrypt shared data? In this paper, we successfully address these issues by proposing a hidden policy attribute-based data sharing scheme with direct revocation and keyword search. In the proposed scheme, the direct revocation of attributes does not need to update the private key of non-revoked users during revocation. In addition, a keyword search is realized in our scheme, and the search time is constant with the increase in attributes. In particular, the policy is hidden in our scheme, and hence, users' privacy is protected. Our security and performance analyses show that the proposed scheme can tackle the security and efficiency concerns in cloud computing.
