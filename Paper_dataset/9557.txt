AB It is said that the evolution of information and communications technology (ICT), such as downsizing and power saving design of sensors, diversification of networks and spread of cloud computing, will cause the number of things connected to the Internet to increase from 10 billion in 2013 to 50 billion in 2020. The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to lead to the creation of new value in combination with big data analysis technology, and have a significant and positive influence on people's lives and the economy. To that end, it is essential to have continuous evolution and innovation of both wired and wireless network technologies, while developing input/output terminals and cloud computing. Wireless networks, in particular, have been driving progress in our lifestyles and business styles by once-a-decade technological revolution since the emergence of mobile phones. This paper first describes the state of technological studies with particular focus on the vision of the fifth-generation mobile communication system (5G), which is the next-generation technology of mobile communication networks, standardization trends, and Fujitsu's activities. It also discusses the usability of the Fujitsu Intelligent Networking and Computing Architecture (FINCA) concept for ICT virtualization and flexibility improvement proposed by Fujitsu, and themes for future network studies to realize wireless access technologies for 5G.
