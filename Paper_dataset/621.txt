AB The final fate of gravitational collapse of massive stars has been a subject of interest for a long time since such a collapse may lead to black holes and naked singularities alike. Since, the formation of naked singularities is forbidden by the cosmic censorship conjecture, exploring their observational differences from black holes may be a possible avenue to search for these exotic objects. The simplest possible naked singularity spacetime emerges from the Einstein massless scalar field theory with the advantage that it smoothly translates to the Schwarzschild solution by the variation of the scalar charge. This background, known as the Janis-Newman-Winicour spacetime is the subject of interest in this work. We explore electromagnetic observations around this metric which involves investigating the characteristics of black hole accretion and shadow. We compute the shadow radius in this spacetime and compare it with the image of M87*, recently released by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration. Similarly, we derive the expression for the luminosity from the accretion disk and compare it with the observed optical luminosity of eleven Palomar Green quasars. Our analysis indicates that the shadow of M87* and the quasar optical data consistently favor the Schwarzschild background over the Janis-Newman-Winicour spacetime. The implications of this result are discussed.
