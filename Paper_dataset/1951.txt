AB Modeling and simulation (M&S) is a promising solution for manufacturers to verify and resolve errors in advance. Recently, M&S using high-performance computing has attracted attention as a technology trend for its efficiency in terms of the time and the cost. However, a huge amount of computing resources is still required to perform an M&S analysis workflow within a short time. For the resolution of this issue, we organize a heterogeneous cluster environment with individual nodes of the diverse performance and OS. An open source-based task scheduler named Son of Grid Engine is used for managing the heterogeneous resources for the experiment. To verify the efficiency and validity of the organization scheme, we have developed an environment for analyzing products and monitoring work through CalculiX, an open source-based finite element analysis solver.
