AB This paper investigates the adaptive barrier coverage system in wireless sensor networks, where multiple mobile sensor nodes collaboratively move based on cloud computing. This system aims to adaptively maintain a barrier coverage surrounding a dynamic zone, such as nuclear leakage area and toxic gas area. Since such a zone is usually dangerous and invisible, it is necessary to monitor and track its boundary for detecting unwanted people nearby and warning them. Existing studies on mobile barrier coverage mainly focus on static zones, which cannot directly apply into dynamic zones because their movement strategies are not flexible with dynamics. To address such a problem, we propose a novel adaptive barrier coverage system. The challenge is to effectively maintain the barrier when the change of dynamic zone is unpredictable. The proposed system leverages the software defined concept, in which the mobile sensor nodes execute the local sensing tasks and the cloud computes the real-time optimal strategy to control the movements of nodes. Extensive simulations based on large-scale real trace demonstrate the efficiency and the efficacy of the proposed system.
