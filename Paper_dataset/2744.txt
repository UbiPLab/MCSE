AB The ability to quickly and accurately forecast flooding is increasingly important as extreme weather events become more common. This work focuses on designing a cloud-based real-time modeling system for supporting decision makers in assessing flood risk. The system, built using Amazon Web Services (AWS), automates access and pre-processing of forecast data, execution of a computationally expensive and high-resolution 2D hydrodynamic model, Two-dimensional Unsteady Flow (TUFLOW), and map-based visualization of model outputs. A graphical processing unit (GPU) version of TUFLOW was used, resulting in an 80x execution time speed-up compared to the central processing unit (CPU) version. The system is designed to run automatically to produce near real-time results and consume minimal computational resources until triggered by an extreme weather event. The system is demonstrated for a case study in the coastal plain of Virginia to forecast flooding vulnerability of transportation infrastructure during extreme weather events.
