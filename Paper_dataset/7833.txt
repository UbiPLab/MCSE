AB In order to solve the competition allocation problem of divisible cloud resource among multi-tenant, an optimal resource allocation strategy based on utility function is proposed in cloud computing. Through defining the evaluation function and the cost function of resource allocation among competing tenants, a utility optimization model is established. The affect of different cost functions on the optimal allocation results is focused, and we have proved that there exists a unique Nash equilibrium solution of resource allocation in our utility model. Experimantal results show that all of the linear cost function and convex cost function can converge to a unique solution, and the linear cost function can bring an optimal system efficiency for a single tenant and maximize the overall social welfare of multi-tenant in the process of social welfare maximization.
