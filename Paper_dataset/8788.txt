AB In this study, the Organizational Project Management Maturity Model (OPM3) is applied to solve the low efficacy and low accuracy of the internal control over an accounting information system in cloud computing. OPM3 is first introduced and then used to establish a 2D framework for the internal control of an accounting information system. The representative key indicators are identified using a specific enterprise as a case and applying a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method for analysis and evaluation to calculate the judgment matrix of various elements. The level of the internal control of the accounting information system of the enterprise is calculated by combining the judgment matrices of OPM3. On the basis of the calculation results, we provide some suggestions on how to improve internal control and to render evaluation results reliable.
