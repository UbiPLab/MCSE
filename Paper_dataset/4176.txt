AB Computing laboratories of universities face a crucial challenge due to technology upgradation. Generally, hardware and software have a few years of lifetime and get outdated after a certain period of time. Especially, the hardware lifespan is too short. Moreover, the maintenance and usage efficiency of the university laboratory is not up to the mark due to resource constraints. To cope up with the software and hardware upgradations, investing again and again for the same laboratory is very tedious and cost inefficient, especially for a developing country like Bangladesh. This paper recommends utilization of Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) under a cloud-based environment to improve the efficiency and maintenance of a computing laboratory. In this paper, we propose a cloud-based network map for the university computing laboratory alongside with its implementation. Several experiments were conducted to identify the energy efficiency, cost, and performance parameters statistics of the proposed solution. The experimental result establishes the proposed recommendation as a cost effective and efficient approach to tackle the aforementioned challenges as well as it increases the versatility of computing in university laboratories.
