AB Nowadays, large volumes of multimedia data are outsourced to the cloud to better serve mobile applications. Along with this trend, highly correlated datasets can occur commonly, where the rich information buried in correlated data is useful for many cloud data generation/dissemination services. In light of this, we propose to enable a secure and efficient cloud-assisted image sharing architecture for mobile devices, by leveraging outsourced encrypted image datasets with privacy assurance. Different from traditional image sharing, we aim to provide a mobile-friendly design that saves the transmission cost for mobile clients, by directly utilizing outsourced correlated images to reproduce the image of interest inside the cloud for immediate dissemination. First, we propose a secure and efficient index design that allows the mobile client to securely find from encrypted image datasets the candidate selection pertaining to the image of interest for sharing. We then design two specialized encryption mechanisms that support secure image reproduction from encrypted candidate selection. We formally analyze the security strength of the design. Our experiments explicitly show that both the bandwidth and energy consumptions at the mobile client can be saved, while achieving all service requirements and security guarantees.
