AB A quality management process plays a vital role in the success of engineering and construction projects. The management process needs to be effective and efficient if projects are to be completed on time and within the project's budget. Many construction projects' quality management processes are paper-based, which makes them time-consuming and inefficient. The next generation of Building Information Modeling (BIM) is the BIM-cloud. The BIM-cloud can help to enhance the effectiveness of a quality management process; it can also save an organization time and money. This paper proposes a quality management model based on cloud computing, mobile devices, and the Autodesk BIM 360 Field software. This software functions as a platform for gathering, managing and controlling the quality of the management data. The process is then applied to a real project in Vietnam to verify the benefits and barriers of using the BIM 360 Field for a construction project.
