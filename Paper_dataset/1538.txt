AB In recent years, cloud computing has motivated new learning tools based on the cloud to collaborate and share content with a large number of students. Thus, the main objective of this paper is to propose structural equation modeling explaining the educational usage of cloud-based tools (CBTs) in terms of their adoption and application in learning activities within a virtual course. The data analysis used a representative sample from Galileo University, Guatemala. The results of the study revealed that usefulness is one of the main reasons for the rapid adoption of CBTs. The study also showed that in terms of educational usage, there is a greater correlation with lower order thinking skills than that with higher order thinking skills of Bloom's taxonomy. Finally, the evidence from this study suggests that from a student perception, peer-to-peer communication and collaboration can be a strong motivation to use CBTs on learning activities.
