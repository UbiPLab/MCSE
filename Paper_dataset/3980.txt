AB Nowadays, security and data access control are some of the major concerns in the cloud storage unit, especially in the medical field. Therefore, a security-aware mechanism and ontology-based data access control (SA-ODAC) has been developed to improve security and access control in cloud computing. The model proposed in this research work is based on two operational methods, namely, secure awareness technique (SAT) and ontology-based data access control (ODAC), to improve security and data access control in cloud computing. The SAT technique is developed to provide security for medical data in cloud computing, based on encryption, splitting and adding files, and decryption. The ODAC ontology is launched to control unauthorized persons accessing data from storage and create owner and administrator rules to allow access to data and is proposed to improve security and restrict access to data. To manage the key of the SAT technique, the secret sharing scheme is introduced in the proposed framework. The implementation of the algorithm is performed by MATLAB, and its performance is verified in terms of delay, encryption time, encryption time, and ontology processing time and is compared with role-based access control (RBAC), context-aware RBAC and context-aware task RBAC, and security analysis of advanced encryption standard and data encryption standard. Ultimately, the proposed data access control and security scheme in SA-ODAC have achieved better performance and outperform the conventional technique.
