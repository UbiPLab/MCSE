AB Cloud storage provides tremendous storage resources for both individual and enterprise users. In a cloud storage system, the data owned by a user are no longer possessed locally. Hence, it is not competent to ensure the integrity of the outsourced data using traditional data integrity checking methods. A privacy-preserving public auditing protocol allows a third party auditor to check the integrity of the outsourced data on behalf of the users without violating the privacy of the data. However, existing privacy-preserving public auditing protocols assume that the end devices of users are powerful enough to compute all costly operations in real time when the data to be outsourced are given. In fact, the end devices may also be those with low computation capabilities. In this paper, we propose two lightweight privacy-preserving public auditing protocols. Our protocols are based on online/offline signatures, by which an end device only needs to perform lightweight computations when a file to be outsourced is available. Besides, our proposals support batch auditing and data dynamics. Experiments show that our protocols are hundreds of times more efficient than a recent proposal regarding to the computational overhead on user side.
