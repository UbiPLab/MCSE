AB This paper proposes an advanced routing method in the purpose of increasing IoT routing device's power-efficiency, which allows to centralize routing tables computing as well as to push loading, related to routing tables computation, towards the Cloud environment at all. We introduced a phased solution for the formulated task. Generally, next steps were performed: stated requirements for the system with Cloud routing, proposed possible solution, and developed the whole system's structure. For a proper study of the efficiency, the experiment was conducted using the developed system's prototype for real-life cases, each represents own cluster size (several topologies by each size), used sizes are: 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27 and 29. Expectable results for this research - decrease the time of cluster's reaction on topology changes (delay, needed to renew routing tables), which improves system's adaptivity.
