AB In recent years, information technology has become a focus of attention. All hardware, software, and communication technologies are growing rapidly. Nowadays, we can't live without technology. We use technology anywhere and anytime, and enjoy the convenience of technology. In particular, all kinds of network services and applications. These communication technologies and services constitute the concept of cloud computing. Cloud computing involves virtualization of service resources on the network; the entire service resources include scheduling, management, maintenance, and so on, which are carried out by specialized personnel. The goal of cloud computing is enabling users to use virtual resource pools maximally and handle large-scale computing problems anytime and anywhere via the network. Robotics is one of the rapidly developing technologies. Although there are numerous research teams working on cloud robots, research on cloud robot systems is still in its infancy and many problems have not yet been considered, such as the issues of robot privatization and communication security. Therefore, we propose a robot cloud service system and focus on four crucial issues: cloud platform central control, robot intelligence technology, robot privatization, and communication security. Finally, we use BAN logic to prove that the proposed scheme achieves mutual authentication and user anonymity. The proposed scheme can also defend against several kinds of attacks, like eavesdropping attack, impersonation attack, parallel session attack, man-in-the-middle attack, and replay attack.
