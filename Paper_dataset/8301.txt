AB The massive growth of cloud computing has led to huge amounts of energy consumption and carbon emissions by a large number of servers. One of the major aspects of cloud computing is its scheduling of many task requests submitted by users. Minimizing energy consumption while ensuring the user's QoS preferences is very important to achieving profit maximization for the cloud service providers and ensuring the user's service level agreement (SLA). Therefore, in addition to implementing user's tasks, cloud data centers should meet the different criteria in applying the cloud resources by considering the multiple requirements of different users. Mapping of user requests to cloud resources for processing in a distributed environment is a well-known NP-hard problem. To resolve this problem, this paper proposes an energy-efficient task-scheduling algorithm based on best-worst (BWM) and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methodology. The main objective of this paper is to determine which cloud scheduling solution is more important to select. First, a decision-making group identify the evaluation criteria. After that, a BWM process is applied to assign the importance weights for each criterion, because the selected criteria have varied importance. Then, TOPSIS uses these weighted criteria as inputs to evaluate and measure the performance of each alternative. The performance of the proposed and existing algorithms is evaluated using several benchmarks in the CloudSim toolkit and statistical testing through ANOVA, where the evaluation metrics include the makespan, energy consumption, and resource utilization.
