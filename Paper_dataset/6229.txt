AB The paper proposes a hybrid mobile cloud computing system, in which mobile applications can use different resources or services in local cloud and remote public cloud such as computation, storage and bandwidth. The cross-layer load-balancing based mobile cloud resource allocation optimization is proposed. The proposed approach augments local cloud service pools with public cloud to increase the probability of meeting the service level agreements. Our problem is divided by public cloud service allocation and local cloud service allocation, which is achieved by public cloud supplier, local cloud agent and the mobile user. The system status information is used in the hybrid mobile cloud computing system such as the preferences of mobile applications, energy, server load in cloud datacenter to improve resource utilization and quality of experience of mobile user. Therefore, the system status of hybrid mobile cloud is monitored continuously. The mathematical model of the system and optimization problem is given. The system design of load-balancing based cross-layer mobile cloud resource allocation is also proposed. Through extensive experiments, this paper evaluates our algorithm and other approaches from the literature under different conditions. The results of the experiments show a performance improvement when compared to the approaches from the literature.
