AB Cloud computing is the future generation of computational services delivered over the Internet. As cloud infrastructure expands, resource management in such a large heterogeneous and distributed environment is a challenging task. In a cloud environment, uncertainty and dispersion of resources encounters problems of allocation of resources. Unfortunately, existing resource management techniques, frameworks and mechanisms are insufficient to handle these environments, applications and resource behaviors. To provide an efficient performance and to execute workloads, there is a need of quality of service (QoS) based autonomic resource management approach which manages resources automatically and provides reliable, secure and cost efficient cloud services. In this paper, we present an intelligent QoS-aware autonomic resource management approach named as CHOPPER (Configuring, Healing, Optimizing and Protecting Policy for Efficient Resource management). CHOPPER offers self-configuration of applications and resources, self-healing by handling sudden failures, self-protection against security attacks and self-optimization for maximum resource utilization. We have evaluated the performance of the proposed approach in a real cloud environment and the experimental results show that the proposed approach performs better in terms of cost, execution time, SLA violation, resource contention and also provides security against attacks.
