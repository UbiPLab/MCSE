AB The present study constructs a multi-agent organizational framework with virtual machine clusters as the unit of granularity based on the results of that previous study. In addition, the present study also investigates the requirements for an orderly and efficient workflow of this multi-agent organizational framework and constructs an abstract system structure based on collaborative agents (including vms-agents and apps-agents) and a collaborative mechanism. Finally, the present study reports a comparative experiment conducted on the CloudSim platform. The experimental results show that the proposed multi-agent organization method with virtual machine clusters as the unit of granularity improves the efficiency of resource utilization and accounts for the interests of both cloud users and providers while ensuring the maintenance of the application service level agreement. Compared with the mechanism of the multi-agent organizational method proposed in the present study, existing studies have generally considered the configuration of a given party only locally and in isolation, severing the intrinsic connection between the resources of virtual machines and the application systems/components that are operating on those virtual machines. As a result, the interests of the cloud users and providers cannot be simultaneously ensured.
