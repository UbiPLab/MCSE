DE Orchestration; OpenStack; resource allocation; VM migration
AB This work is mainly focused on two major topics in cloud platforms by using OpenStack as a case study: management and provisioning of resources to meet the requirements of a service demanded by remote end-user and relocation of virtual machines (VMs) requests to offload the encumbered compute nodes. The general framework architecture contains two subsystems: 1) An orchestrator that allows to systematize provisioning and resource management in OpenStack, and 2) A resource utilization based subsystem for vibrant VM relocation in OpenStack. The suggested orchestrator provisions and manages resources by: 1) manipulating application program interfaces (APIs) delivered by the cloud supplier in order to allocate/control/manage storage and compute resources; 2) interrelating with software-defined networking (SDN) controller to acquire the details of the accessible resources, and training the variations/rules to manage the network based on the requirements of cloud service. For resource provisioning, an algorithm is suggested, which provisions resources on the basis of unused resources in a pool of VMs. A sub-system is suggested for VM relocation in a cloud computing platform. The framework decides the proposed overload recognition, VM allocation algorithms for VM relocation in clouds and VM selection.
