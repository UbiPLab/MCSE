AB With the rapid development of vehicular networks, the problem of data sharing in vehicular networks has attached much attention. However, existing data access control schemes in cloud computing cannot be applied to the scenario of vehicular networks, because cloud computing paradigm cannot satisfy the rigorous requirement posed by latency-sensitive mobile application. Fog Computing is a paradigm that extends Cloud computing and services to the edge of the network. The vehicular fog is the ideal platform to achieve data sharing in vehicular networks. In this paper, we propose a revocable data sharing scheme for vehicular fogs. We construct a new multi-authority ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) scheme with efficient decryption to realize data access control in vehicular network system, and design an efficient user and attribute revocation method for it. The analysis and the simulation results show that our scheme is secure and highly efficient.
