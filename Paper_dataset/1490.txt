AB Fast interactive response in mobile cloud computing is an emerging area of interest. Execution of applications inside the remote cloud increases the delay and affects the service quality. To avoid this difficulty cloudlet is introduced. Cloudlet provides the same service to the device as cloud at low latency but at high bandwidth. But selection of a cloudlet for offloading computation at low power is a major challenge if more than one cloudlet is available nearby. In this paper we have proposed a power and latency aware optimum cloudlet selection strategy for multi-cloudlet environment with the introduction of a proxy server. Theoretical analysis show that using the proposed approach the power and the latency consumption are reduced by approximately 29-32 and 33-36 percent respectively than offloading to the remote cloud. An experimental analysis of the proposed cloudlet selection scheme is performed using cloudlets and cloud servers located at our university laboratory. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that using the proposed strategy power and latency aware cloudlet selection can be performed. The proposed approach is compared with the existing methods on multi-cloudlet scenario to demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces the power consumption and the system response time.
