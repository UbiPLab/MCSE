ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Cloud computing is transforming how Information Technology is procured and utilized by establishments and entities. It ensures active services through scalable and virtualized assets over the Internet. In this work the cloud scheduling problem is investigated for the medical image retrieval (IR) problem. In the medical IR problem images similar to the query image are retrieved from distributed databases after analysis. The image to be processed is transferred to multiple virtual machines for processing and the obtained results sent back to the querying system. Transferring to multiple virtual machine is a scheduling problem and should be secure because of the sensitivity of the data. Since security plays a very important role in cloud, they have no standard task scheduling algorithm for use as it is still novel. This work proposed a modified Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) for cloud scheduling issue using trust.
