AB Speech signal processing and its recognition system have gained a lot of attention from last few years due to its widespread application. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed for diagnosis and monitoring the Parkinson's Disease (PD) which is the second most severe neurological disease in the world. PD is a neurodegenerative disease which impairs person's balance, motor skills, speech, and other characteristics such as decision making process, emotions, and sensation. Here, we proposed a cloud based framework for detecting and monitoring Parkinson patients that will enable healthcare service in low resource setting. In the developing countries, where most of the people do not get proper healthcare services and are not well aware of Parkinson's disease, let alone detecting and getting healthcare for PD, this system can be very practical and useful. For this system, the patients of rural areas, patients from the regions where doctors are not available, can communicate to the doctors only if they have internet connections in their smart phones to access the cloud. Doctors can check and detect patient's PD by checking their voice disorders or Dysphonia over cloud. With this system, a PD patient can be easily detected and diagnosed by giving their voice samples through their phones, regardless of their location. Based on the evaluation, our proposed systems are avail to achieve 96.6% accuracy in the cloud environment for detecting PD. It is expected that the proposed framework will have great potential to enable healthcare service for PD patients, who live in remote areas, especially in developing countries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
