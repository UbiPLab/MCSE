AB Cloud computing is being presented as the technology of the moment, and an additional resource for High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing, particularly regarding its use in support to scientific applications. This paper evaluates the concept of affinity regarding the combined effects of the virtualization layer, applications classes and parallel libraries used in the applications hosted in cloud computing. Affinity or interference are here presented as the degree of influence that one application has on other applications when running concurrently in virtualized environments hosted on the same real environment. The results presented here show how parallel libraries used in application implementation have a significant influence and how the combinations of these types of libraries and classes of applications could significantly influence the performance of the environment.
