AB An important ingredient of fifth generation (5G) networks will he Multiaccess Edge Computing (MEC). MEC brings the computational intelligence of the cloud within the Radio Access Network (RAN). The virtualized functionality is accessible through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). In this paper, we study capabilities of reuse existing time-tested Web Services to provide mobile edge middleware services. The focus is on mobile edge services that can he used by applications for bandwidth management and access to user contextual information. An extension of Web Service functionality is proposed. Implementation issues of Web Services in RAN are considered.
