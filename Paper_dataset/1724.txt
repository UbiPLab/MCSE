AB Edge computing is envisioned as a promising enabler to leverage computation capacities at the edge and address the issues faced in cloud computing. In this paper, we propose an advanced decision model to solve the computation offloading problem in edge computing. It utilizes the intrinsic hierarchical topology of the Internet and performs online scheduling in a decentralized manner to eliminate anticipated modeling. It also admits the fact that congestion can take place unexpectedly, for the possible reasons such as stale information. Our decision model is enhanced in two approaches to endow both sender and receiver (for one offloading action) with the ability of "dropping" the request, so as to avoid congestion. Random Early Detection(RED) algorithm is incorporated. The results of simulation demonstrate that our decision model can handle workloads well and these two enhancements are effective.
