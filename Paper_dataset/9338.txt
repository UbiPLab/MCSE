AB In this article, we propose the dynamic resources management model in a cloud computing environment. For monitoring the certain resource, we should utilize not only a cloud management module but also a network management module. However, it is difficult to check the duration time and to observe the digested information about the resources. To investigate these problems in a cloud computing environment, we designed and deployed the cloud service infrastructure based on open-source software, namely, CloudStack. The proposed model regularly stores the usage data for computing resources based on Hadoop and HBase. In addition, our model analyzes the raw data for virtual machines and makes an effective recommendation regarding the consumption of computing resources.
