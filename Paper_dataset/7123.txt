AB Desktop Virtualization is an essential problem in cloud manufacturing to make full use of shared resources so as to meet the practical application requirements. In this paper, an efficient virtualization solution for desktop transferring is presented for sharing resources. Our strategy is not limited to transfer desktops between virtual machines (VMs), transmission between virtual and physical machines is also achieved. A three-layer systemic structure based on web environment is proposed in the study. We employ the application program library Libvirt and kernel-based virtual machine (KVM) technique to manage VMs with dynamic customization scheme, which gains better virtualization performance. Moreover, we present two different schemes for desktop graphics transferring. One is based on the transport protocol virtual network computing (VNC), and the other adopts the simple protocol for independent computing environment (SPICE), which both achieve more satisfactory results. The validity of our scheme is demonstrated on some experimental results and systemic qualitative evaluation is also provided.
