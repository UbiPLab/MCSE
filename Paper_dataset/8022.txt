AB There has been an increasing demand for connectivity of the clusters of microgrids to increase their flexibility and security. This paper presents a framework for implementation, simulation, and evaluation of a novel power routing algorithm for clusters of microgrids. The presumed cluster is composed of multiple direct current (dc) microgrids connected together through multi-terminal dc system in a meshed network. In this structure, the energy is redirected from the microgrid with excessive power generation capacity to the microgrid which has power shortage to supply its internal loads. The key contribution of this paper is that each microgrid in the cluster is unaware of the current state and other flows of the cluster. In this approach, the optimal power flow problem is solved for the system while managing congestion and mitigating power losses. The proposed methodology works for both radial and non-radial networks regardless of the network topology, scale, and number of microgrids involved in the cluster. Therefore, it is also well suited for largescale optimal power routing problems that will emerge in the future clusters of microgrids. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified byMATLAB simulation. We also present a comprehensive cloud-based platform for further implementation of the proposed algorithm on the OPAL-RT real-time digital simulation system. The communication paths between the microgrids and the cloud environment can be emulated by OMNeT++
