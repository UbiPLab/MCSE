AB In CloudIoT platform, the data is collected and shared by different nodes of Internet of Things (IoT), and data is processed and stored based on cloud servers. It has increased the abilities of IoT on information computation. Meanwhile, it also has enriched the resource in cloud and improved integration of the Internet and human world. All of this offer advantages as well as the new challenges of information security and privacy protection. As the energy limitation of the nodes in IoT, they are particularly vulnerable. It is much easier to hijack the nodes than to attack the data center for hackers. Thus, it is a crucial and urgent issue to realize the trusted update of authorization of nodes. When some nodes are hijacked, both of the behaviors to upload data to servers and to download information from servers should be forbidden. Otherwise, it might cause the serious damage to the sensitive data and privacy of servers. In order to solve this problem, we proposed a Proxy Re-encryption based Trusted Authorization scheme for nodes on CloudIoT (PRTA). PRTA is based on the proxy re-encryption (PRE), and the cloud server will play the roles of data storing and re-encrypting, which would reach the full potential of cloud computing and reduce the cost of nodes. The node's status is taken as one of the parameters for data re-encryption and it is under the authorization servers' control, which could ensure the security and reliability of the data and be beneficial for the privacy protection in CloudIoT. Also, the authorization servers are divided into the downloading and uploading kinds, which will make the application range much wider. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
