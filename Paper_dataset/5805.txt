AB During the calculation of big data, in the principle of marine information management, it is very important to analyze the security of data storage and transmission, so as to make its information management more comprehensive and reasonable. In the cloud computing mode below, it is very important to further optimize the corresponding management scheme of ocean big data and to improve it on this basis can make its services more reliable, thereby providing more diversified ocean information management services. We must make full use of artificial intelligence technology to optimize computer protection strategies, detection strategies, rapid response strategies and security recovery strategies. Among them, the computer protection strategy led by artificial intelligence can avoid illegal access by restricting user rights and verification procedures, maintain the security of network marine data information and avoid information leakage and illegal theft.
