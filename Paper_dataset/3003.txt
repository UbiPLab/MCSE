AB This article describes how cloud computing utilizes the benefits of web engineering and its applications by improving the performance and reducing the load on cloud providers. As the cloud is one of the emerging technology in the field of computing, it is used to provide various services to the user through the internet. One of the major concerns in cloud computing is accessibility of cloud. For estimating the availability of cloud, various load balancing algorithms are deployed in data centers of the cloud environment. Load balancing is a technique that distributes a signal load across various computers for optimizing resource usage, reducing response time, etc. There are different load balancing algorithms, for performing the load distribution across various centers. This article analyses different load balancing algorithms and develop a new algorithm for efficient load balancing. The proposed load balancing algorithm utilizes the concepts of web engineering to prioritize the request of end user using parsing technique, which will assign the resources to the end users based on the priority set by the data centers.
