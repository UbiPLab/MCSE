AB Fog computing is an emerging paradigm that extends computation, communication, and storage facilities toward the edge of a network. Compared to traditional cloud computing, fog computing can support delay-sensitive service requests from end-users (EUs) with reduced energy consumption and low traffic congestion. Basically, fog networks are viewed as offloading to core computation and storage. Fog nodes in fog computing decide to either process the services using its available resource or send to the cloud server. Thus, fog computing helps to achieve efficient resource utilization and higher performance regarding the delay, bandwidth, and energy consumption. This survey starts by providing an overview and fundamental of fog computing architecture. Furthermore, service and resource allocation approaches are summarized to address several critical issues such as latency, and bandwidth, and energy consumption in fog computing. Afterward, compared to other surveys, this paper provides an extensive overview of state-of-the-art network applications and major research aspects to design these networks. In addition, this paper highlights ongoing research effort, open challenges, and research trends in fog computing.
