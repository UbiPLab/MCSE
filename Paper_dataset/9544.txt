DE MapReduce; scheduler; performance interference
AB Recently, virtualization has become more and more important in the cloud computing to support efficient flexible resource provisioning. However, performance interference among virtual machines (VMs) has become a challenge which may affect the effectiveness of resource provisioning. In a virtual cluster which runs the MapReduce applications, the performance interference can also affect the performance of the Map and Reduce tasks and thus cause a performance degradation of the MapReduce job. Accordingly, this paper presents a MapReduce scheduling framework to mitigate this performance degradation caused by the performance interference. The framework includes a performance interference prediction module and an interference aware scheduling algorithm. To verify its effectiveness, we have done a set of experiments on a 24-node virtual MapReduce cluster. The experiments illustrate that the proposed framework can achieve a performance improvement in the virtualized environment compared with other MapReduce schedulers.
