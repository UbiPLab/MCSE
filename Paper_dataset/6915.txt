AB In the cloud computing, the virtual machine (VM) dynamical management method needs to consider VM resource re-configuration caused by system computation resource status changing and load fluctuation. Based on migration objectives as QoS (Quality of Service), resource competition and energy consumption, the VM migration time, migration objective node selection and VM placement strategies are designed in this work. The Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) method is also introduced for migration destination host selection. Experiment results show that the multi-objective optimization management method with TOPSIS can achieve lower service-level agreement (SLA) violation rate, less energy consumption and better balance among different objectives.
