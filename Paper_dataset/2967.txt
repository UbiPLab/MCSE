ID ADAPTIVE SIMPLIFICATION
AB Due to the huge volume and complex structure, simplification of point clouds is an important technique in practical applications. However, the traditional algorithms often lose geometric information and have no dynamic expanding structure. In this paper, a new simplification algorithm is proposed based on conformal geometric algebra. First of all, a multiresolution subdivision is constructed by the sphere tree, which computes the minimal bounding spheres with the help of k-means clustering, and then 2 kinds of simplification methods with full advantages of distance computing convenience are applied to carry out self-adapting simplification. Finally, several comparisons with original data or other algorithms are implemented from visualization to parameter contrast. The results show that the proposed algorithm has good effect not only on the local details but also on the overall error rate.
