AB Due to the gradual expansion in data volume used in social networks and cloud computing, the term "Big data" has appeared with its challenges to store the immense datasets. Many tools and algorithms appeared to handle the challenges of storing big data. NoSQL databases, such as Cassandra and MongoDB, are designed with a novel data management system that can handle and process huge volumes of data. Partitioning data in NoSQL databases is considered one of the critical challenges in database design. In this paper, a MapReduce Rendezvous Hashing-Based Virtual Hierarchies (MR-RHVH) framework is proposed for scalable partitioning of Cassandra NoSQL database. The MapReduce framework is used to implement MR-RHVH on Cassandra to enhance its performance in highly distributed environments. MR-RHVH distributes the nodes to rendezvous regions based on a proposed Adopted Virtual Hierarchies strategy. Each region is responsible for a set of nodes. In addition, a proposed bloom filter evaluator is used to ensure the accurate allocation of keys to nodes in each region. Moreover, a number of experiments were performed to evaluate the performance of MR-RHVH framework, using YCSB for database benchmarking. The results show high scalability rate and less time consuming for MR-RHVH framework over different recent systems.
