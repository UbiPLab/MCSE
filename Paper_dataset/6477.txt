AB Energy-efficient virtual resource allocation algorithm has become a hot research topic in cloud computing. However, most of the existing allocation schemes cannot ensure each type of resource be fully utilized. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a virtual machine (VM) allocation algorithm on the basis of multi-dimensional resource, considering the diversity of user's requests. First, we analyze the usage of each dimension resource of physical machines (PMs) and build a D-dimensional resource state model. Second, we introduce an energy-resource state metric (PAR) and then propose an energy-aware multi-dimensional resource allocation algorithm called MRBEA to allocate resources according to the resource state and energy consumption of PMs. Third, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by real-world datasets. Experimental results show that MRBEA has a better performance in terms of energy consumption, SLA violations and the number of VM migrations.
