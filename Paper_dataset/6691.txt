AB Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) has become an indispensable part of our daily life. Connectivity between human-to-human, human-to-device and device-to-device is playing a vital role in almost everyone's life round the clock. In MCC, wireless connections are used for the sake of communication which got a bit enhanced in 3G technologies. It resulted in the use of wireless voice telephone, internet access and mobile TV. However, after the arrival of 4G technologies, services like mobile web access, IP telephony, gaming services, high-definition mobile TV, video conferencing, and 3D television has become an unbelievable reality. Still there are several issues faced by MCC applications such as: bandwidth, heterogeneity, availability, power consumption and complicated hardware. In this paper, a brief overview of the issues existing in MCC applications is presented. Further, it is discussed how these issues will be addressed by using 5G technology
