AB Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing resources. Cloud computing has numerous applications in fields of education, social networking, and medicine. But the benefit of cloud for medical purposes is seamless, particularly because of the enormous data generated by the health care industry. This colossal data can be managed through big data analytics, and hidden patterns can be extracted using machine learning procedures. In particular, the latest issue in the medical domain is the prediction of heart diseases, which can be resolved through culmination of machine learning and cloud computing. Hence, an attempt has been made to propose an intelligent decision support model that can aid medical experts in predicting heart disease based on the historical data of patients. Various machine learning algorithms have been implemented on the heart disease dataset to predict accuracy for heart disease. Naive Bayes has been selected as an effective model because it provides the highest accuracy of 86.42% followed by AdaBoost and boosted tree. Further, these 3 models are being ensembled, which has increased the overall accuracy to 87.91%. The experimental results have also been evaluated using 10,082 instances that clearly validate the maximum accuracy through ensembling and minimum execution time in cloud environment.
