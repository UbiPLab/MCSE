AB Apache Hadoop becomes ubiquitous for cloud computing which provides resources as services for multi-tenant applications. YARN (a.k.a. MapReduce 2.0) is one of the key features in the second-generation Hadoop, which provides resource management and scheduling for large-scale MapReduce environments. Two enormous challenges in the YARN scheduler are the abilities to automatically tailor and control resource allocations to different jobs for achieving their Service Level Agreements (SLAs), and minimize energy consumption of the overall cloud computing system. In this work, we propose an SLA-aware energy-efficient scheduling scheme which allocates appropriate amount of resources to MapReduce applications with YARN architecture. In our task scheduling policy, We consider the data locality information to save the MapReduce network traffic. Furthermore, the slack time between the actual execution time of completed tasks and expected completion time of the application is utilized to improve the energy-efficiency of the system. An online userspace governor-based dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) scheme is designed in the YARN per-application ApplicationMaster to dynamically change the CPU frequency for upcoming tasks given the slack time from previous completed tasks. Experimental evaluation shows that our proposed scheme outperforms the existing MapReduce scheduling policies in terms of both resource ultization and energy-efficiency.
