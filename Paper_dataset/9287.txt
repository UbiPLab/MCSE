AB We employ the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree for bosons (MCTDHB) method to study excited states of interacting Bose-Einstein condensates confined by harmonic and double-well trap potentials. Two approaches to access excitations, one static and the other dynamic, are investigated and contrasted. In static simulations the low-lying excitations are computed by utilizing a linear-response theory constructed on top of a static MCTDHB solution (LR-MCTDHB). Complimentarily, we propose two dynamic protocols that address excitations by propagating the MCTDHB wave function. In particular, we investigate dipolelike oscillations induced by shifting the origin of the confining potential and breathinglike excitations by quenching the frequency of a parabolic part of the trap. To contrast static predictions and dynamic results we compute the time evolution and regard the respective Fourier transform of several local and nonlocal observables. Namely, we study the expectation value of the position operator < x(t)>, its variance Var[x(t)], and a local density computed at selected positions. We find that the variance is the most sensitive and informative quantity: Along with excitations it contains information about deexcitations even in a linear regime of the induced dynamics. The dynamic protocols are found to access the many-body excitations predicted by the static LR-MCTDHB approach.
