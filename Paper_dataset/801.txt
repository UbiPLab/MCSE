AB This article presents a secure and private implementation of linear time-invariant dynamic controllers using Paillier's encryption, a semihomomorphic encryption method. To avoid overflow or underflow within the encryption domain, the state of the controller is reset periodically. A control design approach is presented to ensure stability and optimize performance of the closed-loop system with encrypted controller.
