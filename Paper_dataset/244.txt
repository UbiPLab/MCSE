AB With the advent of the Internet of Everything, more and more devices are connected to the Internet every year. In major cities, in order to maintain normal social order, the demand for deployed cameras is also increasing. In terms of public safety, person Re-Identification (ReID) can play a big role. However, the current methods of ReID are to transfer the collected pedestrian images to the cloud for processing, which will bring huge communication costs. In order to solve this problem, we combine the recently emerging edge computing and use the edge to combine the end devices and the cloud to implement our proposed binarized segmented ResNet. Our method is mainly to divide a complete ResNet into three parts, corresponding to the end devices, the edge, and the cloud. After joint training, the corresponding segmented sub-network is deployed to the corresponding side, and inference is performed to realize ReID. In our experiments, we compared some traditional ReID methods in terms of accuracy and communication overhead. It can be found that our method can greatly reduce the communication cost on the basis of basically not reducing the recognition accuracy of ReID. In general, the communication cost can be reduced by four to eight times.
