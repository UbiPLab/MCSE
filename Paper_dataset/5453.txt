AB Service-oriented architecture (SOA) has a crucial role in backing productive cloud services. Also, the vast spread of the theoretical notion of diverse businesses (like e-commerce) into the actual use has been recently applied by cloud computing. The service functionality could be affected by overfilling of the network traffic because of the broadly dispersed nature of e-commerce in clouds-a key challenge for immediate jobs. Throughout the last decade, a vast range of applications or large-scale operators has increasingly attracted to migrate the services in clouds. An effective method for accessing the applications throughout standard business hours is continually moving virtual machine containers from one data center to another. Now, with the commonness of cloud computing, many applications have been moved to the cloud fully/partly. It can be handled through the migration of cloud services to diverse platforms in a way that minimizes the communication cost of e-commerce. As this issue has an NP-hard nature, in the present article, we present an automatic smart service migration outline through the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm on cloud-oriented e-commerce. In the presented model, we use the ACO algorithm to take the finest (near-optimal) service migration decisions. Based on the obtained results, the proposed technique has the optimal number of migrations compared to the existing models.
