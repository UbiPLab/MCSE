AB Internet-of-Things (IoT) is massively growing and introducing several benefits that are able to transform the world. Also, cloud computing has become significantly important due to its ability to handle large sets of data. IoT and cloud computing present a stalwart combination that can enrich several analytics and applications. Nevertheless, cloud data security and users privacy can have gaps. Especially when the IoT and cloud systems deal with a dynamically behaving users within a centralized and costly environment. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a dynamic access control scheme that considers the users' behavior while making the access control decisions within a reasonable time. In this paper, we introduce a Multi-Dimensional Access Control (MD-AC) scheme for dynamically authorizing and revoking users in the cloud with multiple authorities. The experimental results indicate that MD-AC can evaluate access requests within reasonable and acceptable processing times. By considering very hard experimental conditions and numerous transactions, the average encryption and decryption times are 18 and 10 ms respectively. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is validated and compared with recent state-of-art schemes. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is fast and robust against different well-known attacks. Moreover, MD-AC can be used for keeping the privacy of IoT services over the cloud environment.
