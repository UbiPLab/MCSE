AB Homomorphic encryption allows the direct operations on encrypted data, which provides a promising way to protect outsourcing data in clouds. However, it can not guarantee the end-to-end data security if different cloud services are composed together. Especially for the operations on encrypted data, it may violate the standard noninterference, which can not be solved by traditional information flow control approaches. In order to analyze the information flow with encrypted data, we define a new type of flow called the encryption flow to describe the dependence relationship among different encrypted data objects across multiple services. Based on the new definition on encrypted flow, we propose the secure information flow verification theorem and specify the improved security constraints on each service component. Then a distributed information flow control framework and algorithm are designed for verification on regular and encrypted flow across multiple clouds. Through the experiments, we can obtain that our approach is more appropriate for the verification across multiple clouds and provides a more effective way compared with centralized verification approaches.
