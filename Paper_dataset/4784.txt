AB In this paper, the problem of maintaining the quality of service with respect to high communication cost, available bandwidth, and security is investigated in a mobile cloud environment. A Bayesian cooperative coalition game is formulated in which learning automata stationed at Radio frequency identification (RFID) readers are assumed as the players. These players form a coalition among themselves using newly defined payoff value function (PVF) based upon the communication cost, network bandwidth, and storage requirements. Each player in the game makes his best efforts to increase his individual PVF for which it selects one of the strategies from the strategy space using the conditional probability. For each action taken by the players, they may get a reward or a penalty from the environment according to which they update their action probability vector. Tags are arranged in acyclic directed graph, and a secure access control algorithm is proposed, which results a complexity of O (log(n)) in comparison with earlier solutions having the complexity of O (n). The proposed scheme is evaluated in comparison with other schemes by extensive simulations using various metrics. The results obtained show that the proposed scheme is effective in maintaining the RFID-based secure data dissemination in the mobile cloud environment. In particular, there is a reduction of 20% in computational time, and overhead generated with an increase of more than 30% in packet delivery ratio.
