AB Networking plays a crucial role in cloud computing especially in an inter-cloud environment, where data communications among data centers located at different geographical sites form the foundation of inter-cloud federation. Data transmissions required for inter-cloud federation in the complex inter-cloud networking system are often point-to-multi points, which calls for a more effective and efficient multicast routing algorithm in complex networking systems. In this paper, we investigate the multicast routing problem in the inter-cloud context with K constraints where K >= 2. Unlike most of existing algorithms that are too complex to be applied in practical scenarios, a novel and fast algorithm for establishing multicast routing tree for inter-clouds is proposed. The proposed algorithm leverages an entropy-based process to aggregate all weights into a comprehensive metric, and then uses it to search a multicast tree (MT) on the basis of the shortest path tree (SPT). We conduct complexity analysis and extensive simulations for the proposed algorithm from the approximation perspective. Both analytical and experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm is more efficient than a representative multi-constrained multicast routing algorithm in terms of both speed and accuracy, and thus we believe that the proposed algorithm is applicable to the inter-cloud environment.
