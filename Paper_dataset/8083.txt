AB With the rapid development of service-oriented computing, cloud computing and big data, a large number of functionally equivalent web services are available on the Internet. Quality of Service (QoS) becomes a differentiating point of services to attract customers. Since the QoS of services varies widely among users due to the unpredicted network, physical location and other objective factors, many Collaborative Filtering based approaches are recently proposed to predict the unknown QoS by employing the historical user-contributed QoS data. However, most existing approaches ignore the data credibility problem and are thus vulnerable to the unreliable QoS data contributed by dishonest users. To address this problem, we propose a trust-aware approach TAP for reliable personalized QoS prediction. Firstly, we cluster the users and calculate the reputation of users based on the clustering information by a beta reputation system. Secondly, a set of trustworthy similar users is identified according to the calculated user reputation and similarity. Finally, we identify a set of similar services by clustering the services and make prediction for active users by combining the QoS data of the trustworthy similar users and similar services. Comprehensive real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach compared with other state-of-the-art approaches. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.
