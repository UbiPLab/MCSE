AB This paper presents a new method for multi-view images registration based on stereo vision system. Our aim is to recover the surface shape of the subject accurately and efficiently in spite of the influences derived from illumination variation, blur affection and image transformation on the 2D images. For this purpose, we devote to developing an innovative stereo registration algorithm. In the first phase, a novel feature descriptor is constructed by adding multi-scale Gaussian parameters into the illumination-robust and anti-blur combined moment invariants in fusion of the pixel gray and gradient. The new Gaussian combined moment invariants are calculated on the multi-scale low frequency sub-band by Contourlet transform. Meanwhile, grid entropy was computed on the multi-direction high frequency sub-band as to get the structure characteristics of the image. Then a novel compound feature descriptor was presented by a combination of the Gaussian moment invariants and grid entropy. It is applied to conduct the similarity measure for the initial image registration. In the second phase, the bidirectional matching strategy with strict geometric constraints composed of the distance and the slope between matching pairs is proposed for eliminating the incorrect matching pairs in the initial image registration. Consequently, the correct matching pairs are obtained at this stage. The experimental results reveal that both the accuracy and the efficiency of our approach are superior to those of SIFT and SURF. Finally, 3D cloud data and 3D model of the subject are achieved.
