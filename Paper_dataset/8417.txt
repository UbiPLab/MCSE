AB Since the emergence of cloud computing service level objectives (SLOs) and service level agreements (SLAs) have put themselves forward as one of the key enablers for cloud's on-demand, pay-as-you-go service consumption model. To date, the vast majority of cloud platforms provide support for SLAs only in terms of statically predefined SLOs, e.g., service availability, and low-level resource capacity guarantees, e.g., CPU usage. Unfortunately, there is only limited support to clearly map workload performance requirements to the resource capacity guarantees. In this article, we introduce SLOC- a novel elasticity framework, which promotes a novel performance-driven, SLO-native approach to cloud computing. We outline the main research challenges, vision, and approach of our SLOC framework toward the SLO-native paradigm in next generation cloud computing.
