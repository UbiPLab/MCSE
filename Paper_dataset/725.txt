AB In-memory computing reduces latency and energy consumption of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) by reducing the number of off-chip memory accesses. However, crossbar-based in-memory computing may significantly increase the volume of on-chip communication since the weights and activations are on-chip. State-of-the-art interconnect methodologies for in-memory computing deploy a bus-based network or mesh-based Network-on-Chip (NoC). Our experiments show that up to 90% of the total inference latency of a DNN hardware is spent on on-chip communication when the bus-based network is used. To reduce the communication latency, we propose a methodology to generate an NoC architecture along with a scheduling technique customized for different DNNs. We prove mathematically that the generated NoC architecture and corresponding schedules achieve the minimum possible communication latency for a given DNN. Furthermore, we generalize the proposed solution for edge computing and cloud computing. Experimental evaluations on a wide range of DNNs show that the proposed NoC architecture enables 20%-80% reduction in communication latency with respect to state-of-the-art interconnect solutions.
