AB Cloud Computing-based Software as a Service (SaaS) combines multiple Web Services in order to satisfy an SaaS request. SaaS is based on service-oriented architecture and Web Service technology which are popular paradigm to design new generation of applications. In addition, SaaS composition can maintain Data as a Service (DaaS) to answer the needs of a customer that cannot be satisfied by a single Web Service. SaaS/DaaS composition may reveal privacy sensitive information. In this paper, we propose a formal model of privacy in order to verify compatibility of services involved in this composition in terms of their privacy capabilities. We propose a new technique that translates the problem of minimum SaaS/DaaS Web Services Composition within preserved-privacy into Satisfiability problem. We propose also a generalization of this approach to take into account the Quality of Service. In order to show that our approach is feasible and efficient in practice, experiment results are provided as a benchmark.
