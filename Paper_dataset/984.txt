AB Multiple servers collaboration technology is the foundation to realize cloud computing deployed in the distributed environments. Service providers could supply massive data and service to authorized users on the cloud infrastructure, instead of maintaining them in the local servers. It is essential for cloud platforms to develop a uniform authentication system, which manages users access control and authorization. Recently, Irshad et al. presented a chaotic map-based authentication protocol for the multiple servers architecture, which is recognized susceptible to session key recovery attack and identity theft attack. There is an inherent vulnerability in the session key negotiation based on Chebyshev chaotic map-based public key system and the attacker could retrieve cleartext from a given ciphertext. It is the most crippling issue to result the aforementioned susceptibilities. In this paper, we illustrate the faults in Irshad et al.s proposal and devise a solution with a tripartite authentication strategy, in which we replace the constant $T_{p}(x)$ with a disparate value for each users. Both the formal security analysis validated by BAN-logic focused on the tripartite authentication protocol and the heuristic analysis demonstrate the security reliability of the proposed protocol. Compare to the previous related solutions with the tripartite authentication strategy, our proposal possesses a superior security property and the better scalability with considerable efficiency.
