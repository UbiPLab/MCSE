AB The purpose of this study is to analyze the application of cloud computing in power security monitoring. In this study, firstly, cloud computing technology, open source Hadoop platform and HDFS distributed file system are introduced. Secondly, based on the Gap Statistic Algorithm (GSA) for adverse data identification in power system, an optimization scheme of GSA based on cloud computing is designed. Finally, the implementation process based on cloud computing, map process and reduce process of GSA algorithm are introduced. The results show that the application of cloud computing to power system can improve the existing power grid data computing and storage capacity, and improve the status quo of state estimation of power system. Therefore, it is of practical engineering significance to study the adverse data identification algorithm of power system based on cloud computing, which conforms to the development demand of power system informatization.
