AB Web ground control" (webGC) provides users with instantaneous access to mine design applications anywhere, at any time, through a web browser. Utilizing a web-based multiple-tier architecture, users are able to easily access ground control designs, perform on-demand calculations in the field, as well as facilitate project collaborations across multiple users, devices, and operating systems. Currently, the webGC platform contains five ground control related design applications previously developed and distributed by the US National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), that is, analysis of roof bolt stability (ARBS), analysis of longwall pillar stability (ALPS), analysis of retreat mining stability (ARMPS), analysis of retreat mining stability-highwall mining (ARMPS-HWM), and analysis of horizontal stress in mining (AHSM). With respect to design decisions made by the webGC development team, the webGC platform will be able to further integrate future mine design applications providing the mining industry with one of a kind umbrella suite of ground control related software available at ones fingertips. The following paper provides a detailed overview on the current state of the webGC platform with discussions ranging from back-end database development and design to the front-end user-platform interface. Based on current progress in platform development as well as beta testing results, the webGC platform is scheduled for release in the fall of 2018.
