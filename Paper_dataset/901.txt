AB At present, the development of AI depends on three core elements: high-quality data, accurate algorithms and sufficient computing power. New technologies represented by big data, cloud computing and AI are exerting a significant impact on traditional data protection. Individuals' control over their personal data is weakening, data protection is becoming more difficult, and traditional measures of privacy protection are at risk of failure. These are the most representative problems in the conflict between the development of new technology and privacy protection. A new legal and ethical framework that values humans' physical safety, health and dignity should be established and deeply integrated into the entire life cycle of the design, production and application of medical AI. Based on this premise, effort should be made to promote the development of medical AI for the benefit of mankind.
