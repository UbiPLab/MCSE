AB There is a complex problem regarding security of data in cloud, it becomes more critical when the data in question is highly sensitive. One of the main approaches to overcome this problem is the encryption data at rest, which comes with its own difficulties such as efficient key management, access permissions and similar. In this paper, we propose a new approach to security that is controlled by the IT Security Specialist (ITSS) of the company/organization. The approach is based on multiple strategies of file encryption, partitioning and distribution among multiple storage providers, resulting in increased confidentiality since a supposed attacker will need to first obtain parts of a file from different storage providers, know how to combine them, before any decryption attempt. All details of the strategy used for a particular file are stored on a separate file, which can be considered as a master key for the file contents. Also, we will present each strategy with the results and comments related to the realized measurements.
