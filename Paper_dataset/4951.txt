ID MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES; PREDICTION; FRAMEWORK
AB Outsourcing data in clouds is adopted by more and more companies and individuals due to the profits from data sharing and parallel, elastic, and on-demand computing. However, it forces data owners to lose control of their own data, which causes privacy-preserving problems on sensitive data. Sorting is a common operation in many areas, such as machine learning, service recommendation, and data query. It is a challenge to implement privacy-preserving sorting over encrypted data without leaking privacy of sensitive data. In this paper, we propose privacy-preserving sorting algorithms which are on the basis of the logistic map. Secure comparable codes are constructed by logistic map functions, which can be utilized to compare the corresponding encrypted data items even without knowing their plaintext values. Data owners firstly encrypt their data and generate the corresponding comparable codes and then outsource them to clouds. Cloud servers are capable of sorting the outsourced encrypted data in accordance with their corresponding comparable codes by the proposed privacy-preserving sorting algorithms. Security analysis and experimental results show that the proposed algorithms can protect data privacy, while providing efficient sorting on encrypted data.
