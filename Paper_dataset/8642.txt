AB This study investigates the readiness and basis for adoption of cloud computing for higher education in the United Arab Emirates using the Theory of Acceptance Model [1] and structured equation modeling. After the concept of cloud computing was introduced through an educational technology course, empirical data were derived from an online questionnaire with 239 pre-service teachers and undergraduate students. Hypotheses about users' acceptance and adoption of cloud computing were tested. The findings revealed that perceived ease of use affected the intention to use the technology in the future, and intention to use was demonstrated in the teachers' actual use. The study's outcomes provide educational institutions and cloud service providers a better understanding of cloud computing adoption issues. It also supports the foundation for upcoming research focused at improving our awareness of technology adoption and continued-use factors for innovation in instructional technologies. The implications are discussed in the context of education.
