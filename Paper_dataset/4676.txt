AB The widespread use of social media, cloud computing, and Internet of Things generates massive behavior data recorded by system logs, and how to utilize these data to improve the stability and security of these systems becomes more and more difficult due to the increasing number of users and amount of data. In this paper, we propose a novel model named behavior rhythm (BR) to characterize and visualize the user's behaviors from the massive logs and apply it to the system security management. Based on the BR model, we conduct the clustering analysis to mine the user clusters. Different management and access control policies can be applied to different clusters to improve the management efficiency. Then, we apply the non-negative matrix factorization method to analyze the BRs and perform abnormal detection, and employ the BR similarity calculation to perform fast potential anomaly tracking. The detection and tracing results can help the administrators to control the threats efficiently. Experimental results based on the datasets collected from the campus network center of Xi'an Jiaotong University verify the accuracy and efficiency of our method in user behavior profiling and security management, which lay a solid foundation for improving system stability and quality of service.
