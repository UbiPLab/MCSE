AB Cloud-based technologies are driving positive changes in the way organizations can communicate. In running a global business, the need for travel and being available in meetings is a must. However, with expensive travel costs, an alternative solution to overcome this problem is required. This paper presents, a new approach that enhances current 2D video calls to 3D video calls benefiting from the unlimited features of the cloud-computing infrastructure. Three technologies were implemented, OpenStack cloud, webRTC call and 3D anaglyph effect to achieve the sense of 3D video. Experiments proved that our approach has better CPU performance by 47% compared to 65% for traditional peer-to-peer 3D video call. In addition, our implementation has better PSNR value by 0.991 dB compared to 3D video call on peer-to-peer. Survey results stated, 60% of participants found our anaglyph video has a good effect, and 45% found that our video is 75% similar to YouTube video. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
