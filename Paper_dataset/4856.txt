AB Cloud computing is nowadays becoming a popular paradigm for the provision of computing infrastructure that enables organizations to achieve financial savings. On the other hand, there are some known obstacles, among which vendor lock-in stands out. Furthermore, due to missing standards and heterogeneities of cloud storage systems, the migration of data to alternative cloud providers is expensive and time-consuming. We propose an approach based on Semantic Web services and AI planning to tackle cloud vendor data lock-in problem. To complete the mentioned task, data structures and data type mapping rules between different types of cloud storage systems are defined. The migration of data among different providers of platform as a service is presented in order to prove the practical applicability of the proposed approach. Additionally, this concept was also applied to software as a service model of cloud computing to perform one-shot data migration from Zoho CRM to Salesforce CRM.
