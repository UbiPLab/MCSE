AB To address the latency issue of the cloud-centric IoT management systems, researchers have introduced fog and edge computing (FEC) architecture, which distributes the computational tasks and decision making from the distant cloud to the edge or near the edge of IoT network. Considering the need for dynamic process migration from the mobile sensors to other resources when the mobile sensors are unable to continue their tasks, the IoT system needs to provide a flexible mechanism that allows the mobile sensors to dynamically migrate their tasks to the other FEC resources at runtime. The paper proposes a resource-aware edge process migration (REM) scheme that is capable of optimising the process migration decision. To realise such a system and to validate the REM scheme, the authors have developed a framework called edge process-enabled internet of thing (EPIoT) host. The framework and the REM scheme are implemented and evaluated. The results have shown that the REM scheme is capable of enhancing the performance of the process migration in heterogeneous FEC environment.
