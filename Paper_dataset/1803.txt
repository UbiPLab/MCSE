AB The realization of mobile edge computing (MEC) over emerging fifth (5G) generation of wireless systems arises as a driving-force in the future of cloud computing. In order to cope with the volume, variety, and velocity of the IoT traffic while making optimal use of the network infrastructure, a synergistic exploitation of MEC and 5G should be put forward to support advanced resource management applications. In this paper, we propose the use of joint parallelism between wireless and cloud domains to efficiently respond to mobile data deluge. We review the literature, discuss the enabling network architecture, potentials. challenges, and open issues related to the realization of such level of parallelism. We present and evaluate two design examples - parallel computation offload method (PCOM) and parallel transmission and storage method (PTSM)-which outline the benefits of parallelism for computation-hungry and storage-hungry applications, respectively. Results of our optimization formulation show that PCOM and PTSM are able to make an efficient use of the network resources and support a heavy instantaneous workload by means of the parallelism.
