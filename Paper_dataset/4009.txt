ID PARALLEL DELAUNAY TRIANGULATION; ALGORITHM
AB Due to the memory limitation and lack of computing power of consumer level computers, there is a need for suitable methods to achieve 3D surface reconstruction of large-scale point cloud data. A method based on the idea of divide and conquer approaches is proposed. Firstly, the kd-tree index was created for the point cloud data. Then, the Delaunay triangulation algorithm of multicore parallel computing was used to construct the point cloud data in the leaf nodes. Finally, the complete 3D mesh model was realized by constrained Delaunay tetrahedralization based on piecewise linear system and graph cut. The proposed method performed surface reconstruction on the point cloud in the multicore parallel computing architecture, in which memory release and reallocation were implemented to reduce the memory occupation and improve the running efficiency while ensuring the quality of the triangular mesh. The proposed algorithm was compared with two classical surface reconstruction algorithms using multigroup point cloud data, and the applicability experiment of the algorithm was carried out; the results verify the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed approach.
