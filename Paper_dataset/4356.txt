AB Although the cloud computing domain is progressing rapidly, the deployment of various network intensive software utilities in the cloud is still a challenging task. The Quality of Service (QoS) for various gaming, simulations, videoconferencing, video streaming or even file uploading tasks may be significantly affected by the quality and geolocation of the selected underlying computing resources, which are available only when the specific functionality is required. This study presents a new architecture for geographic orchestration of network intensive software components which is designed for high QoS. Key elements of this architecture are a Global Cluster Manager operating within Software-Defined Data Centres (SDDCs), a runtime QoS Monitoring System, and a QoS Modeller and Decision Maker for automated orchestration of software utilities. The implemented system automatically selects the best geographically available computing resource within the SDDC according to the developed QoS model of the software component. This architecture is event-driven as the services are deployed and destroyed in real-time for every usage event. The utility of the implemented orchestration technology is verified qualitatively and in relation to the potential gains of selected QoS metrics by using two network intensive software utilities implemented as containers: an HTTP(S) File Upload service and a Jitsi Meet videoconferencing service. The study shows potential for QoS improvements in comparison to existing orchestration systems.
