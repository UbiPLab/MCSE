AB With the continuous development of Internet of Things (IoT) and the overwhelming explosion of Big Data, edge computing serves as an efficient computing mode for time stringent data processing, which can bypass the constraints of network bandwidth and delay, and has been one of the foundation of interconnected applications. Although edge computing has gradually become one of bridges between cloud computing centers and mobile terminals, the literature still lacks a thorough review on the recent advances in edge computing platforms. In this paper, we firstly introduce the definition of edge computing and advantages of edge computing platform. And then, we summarize the key technologies of constructing an edge computing platform, and propose a general framework for edge computing platform. The role of distributed storage management systems in building edge computing platform is elaborated in detail. Furthermore, we give some applications to illustrate how to use third-party edge computing platforms to build specific applications. Finally, we briefly outline current open issues of edge computing platform based on our literature survey. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
