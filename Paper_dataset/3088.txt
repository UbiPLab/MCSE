AB Cloud computing plays a major role in sharing data and resources to other devices through data outsourcing. During sharing resources, it is a challenging task to provide access control and secure write operations. The main issue is to provide secure read and write operations collaboratively and to reduce computational overload by effective key management. In this paper, a secure and an efficient data collaboration scheme blowfish hybridized weighted attribute-based Encryption (BH-WABE) for secure data writing and proficient access control has been proposed. Here, weight is assigned to each attribute based on its importance and data are encrypted using access control policies. The cloud service provider stores the outsourced data and an attribute authority revokes or updates the attributes by assigning different attributes based on the weight. The receiver can access the data file corresponding to its weight in order to reduce the computational overload. The proposed BH-WABE provides collusion resistance, multiauthority security and fine-grained access control in terms of security, reliability, and efficiency. The performance is compared with the conventional hybrid attribute-based encryption (HABE) scheme in terms of data confidentiality, flexible access control, data collaboration, full delegation, partial decryption, verification, and partial signing.
