AB With the great advance in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) sector, the recent years have witnessed an unprecedented wave of the proliferation of heterogeneous IoT devices and applications. Among them, some have stringent hard deadlines which can only be satisfied by the emerging paradigm of mobile-edge computing (MEC), while the others may pose elastic soft deadlines which can be flexibly fulfilled by cloud computing. However, with the presence of both temporal and spatial diversities of the resource cost of MEC and cloud, it remains a practical challenge how to efficiently provision the MEC and cloud resource to minimize the long-term operational cost, while still guaranteeing both hard and soft deadlines for heterogeneous IoT applications. To navigate such an inherent performance-cost tradeoff, an efficient online cloud-edge resource provisioning framework is proposed, based on the delay-aware Lyapunov optimization technique. Without requiring a priori knowledge of the statistics of the cloud-edge system, the proposed framework allows to make online greedy decisions on how much MEC and cloud resources to be provisioned to heterogeneous IoT applications. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we prove that without violating both the hard and soft deadlines of heterogeneous IoT applications, the long-term operational cost can be pushed arbitrarily close to the offline optimum. With extensive evaluations driven by realistic traffic and cost traces, we empirically demonstrate the cost efficiency of the proposed cloud-edge resource provisioning framework.
