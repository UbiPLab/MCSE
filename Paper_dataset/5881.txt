AB The staggering progress of mobile computing has brought forth exciting opportunities in the research community which are currently stretching beyond the limits of modern battery technologies. Although energy efficiency is of utmost importance in mobile systems, current solutions fail to take into consideration the intrinsic mobility of handhelds-and are based on overusing power-hungry cellular networks for off loading into the cloud. We propose a novel collaboration model based on context-awareness and opportunistic networking in the context of 5G wireless networks which offers the possibility of offloading tasks in an opportunistic cloud based on mobile communities. We apply our solution to a real-life use-case, namely preventive patient monitoring, and show through experimental analysis based on real user traces that it maximizes power saving and minimizes overall execution time of tasks.
