AB The results of observation of the development of a high-depth thunder-hail storm is presented. The measurements were carried out with the MRL-5 weather radar and LS8000 lightning detection system. The electrical parameters of the investigated cloud obtained with LS8000 as well as their relations to radar-derived cloud characteristics and to the indirect criteria of electrical conditions computed on their basis are analyzed. The possibility to forecast thunderstorm based on different thermodynamic criteria is investigated. The high correlation was revealed between the total lightning current in the LF range and the lightning flash rate in the LF and VHF ranges. The total charge transferred by negative lightnings from this cloud to the ground is equal to 387 C; the average value of charge per one lightning is 0.44 C. Regression equations linking the radar criteria of lightnings and the lightning flash rate are presented.
