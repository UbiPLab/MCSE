AB Multi-tenancy promises high utilization of available system resources and helps maintaining cost-effective operations for service providers. However, multi-tenant high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructures, like dynamic HPC clouds, bring unique challenges, both associated with providing performance isolation to the tenants, and achieving efficient load-balancing across the network fabric. Each tenant should experience predictable network performance, unaffected by the workload of other tenants. At the same time, it is equally important that the network links are balanced, avoiding network saturation. The network saturation can lead to unpredictable application performance, and a potential loss of profit for the cloud service providers.
   In this paper, we present two significant extensions to our previously proposed partition-aware fat-tree routing algorithm, pFTree, for InfiniBand-based HPC systems. First, we extend pFTree to incorporate provider defined partition-wise policies that govern how the nodes in different partitions are allowed to share network resources with each other. Second, we present a weighted version of the pFTree routing algorithm, that besides partitions, also takes node traffic characteristics into account to balance load across the network links more evenly. A comprehensive evaluation comprising both real-world experiments and simulations confirms the correctness and feasibility of the proposed extensions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
