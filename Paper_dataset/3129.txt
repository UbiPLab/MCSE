AB When the information is exchanged and transmitted among the group members in mobile cloud environment, the group members may distribute different security domains. The information exchanged among group members may have different secret levels in this environment. When a person has some secret information, he only wants to share these information with some people who have the appropriate level of security permissions, other than all the members in the group. Aiming at these needs, we propose a flexible Asymmetric group key agreement (AGKA) protocol that information exchange and transmission are specific-targeting. The paper adopts bilinear mapping and two-way anonymous authentication technology to hide personal identity authentication information, and uses storage and computing migration technology to reduce the resource consumption of mobile terminal, and also proposes the secret key factor oriented extraction and combinations technology to achieve multi-level three-dimensional complex space security information exchange requirements and meet the lightweight computing. The analysis proves that the protocol has good safety performance and low resource consumption.
