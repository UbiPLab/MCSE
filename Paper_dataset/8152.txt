AB Currently, universities, as centers of research and innovation, integrate in their processes various technologies that allow improving services and processes for their members. Among the innovative technologies are the Internet of Things that, through a variety of devices, allows obtaining data from the environment and people. This information is processed in cloud computing models and Big Data architectures that obtain knowledge through data analysis. These results lead to improving processes and making better decisions that improve the services available at the university. The integration of technologies allows for the generation of a sustainable environment that seeks the cohesion of the population with the environment, in such a way that economic growth is guaranteed in balance with the environment. However, all technology needs to guarantee the security of processes and data, and for this purpose, a new technology such as blockchain is integrated, which seeks to respond to two needs, the security and agility of processes. Integrating this technology in a university requires the analysis of the blockchain components to generate a new layer that adapts to the architecture of a university campus. This ensures that the data are kept cryptographically private to avoid exposure and that the entire process is verified by multiple blocks.
