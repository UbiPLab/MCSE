AB With the accelerated process of urbanization, more and more people tend to live in cities. In order to deal with the big data that are generated by citizens and public city departments, new information and communication technologies are utilized to process the urban data, which makes it more easier to manage. Cloud computing is a novel computation technology. After cloud computing was commercialized, there have been lot of cloudbased applications. Since the cloud service is provided by the third party, the cloud is semi-trusted. Due to the features of cloud computing, there are many security issues in cloud computing. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a promising cryptography technique which can be used in the cloud to solve many security issues. In this paper, we propose a framework for urban data sharing by exploiting the attribute-based cryptography. In order to fit the real world ubiquitous-cities utilization, we extend our scheme to support dynamic operations. In particular, from the part of performance analysis, it can be concluded that our scheme is secure and can resist possible attacks. Moreover, experimental results and comparisons show that our scheme is more efficient in terms of computation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
