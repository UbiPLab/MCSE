AB With the popularization of cloud computing, various cloud services have emerged, and hybrid clouds that can take advantage of combining public and private clouds are attracting attention. However, because of their variety, determining a combination of cloud services suited to the user's current environment and requirements is expensive when deploying a hybrid cloud. Even if the required services are available, there is a lack of tools to connect them, manage them in batches, and utilize the integrated environment. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a cloud selection and integration process (C-SIP), which selects and integrates a combination of cloud services through a hybrid cloud service broker (hybrid CSB), which is an automation solution supporting hybrid cloud deployment. Moreover, the proposed method is realized using a script including the application programming interface of each cloud service. The proposed C-SIP will be used as a core approach toward the hybrid CSB, which is expected to facilitate the introduction of hybrid clouds and the acquisition of cloud strategies.
