AB Due to the rapid development of the maritime networks, there has been a growing demand for computation-intensive applications which have various energy consumption, transmission bandwidth and computing latency requirements. Mobile edge computing (MEC) can efficiently minimize computational latency by offloading computation tasks by the terrestrial access network. In this work, we introduce a space-air-ground-sea integrated network architecture with edge and cloud computing components to provide flexible hybrid computing service for maritime service. In the integrated network, satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide the users with edge computing services and network access. Based on the architecture, the joint communication and computation resource allocation problem is modelled as a complex decision process, and a deep reinforcement learning based solution is designed to solve the complex optimization problem. Finally, numerical results verify that the proposed approach can improve the communication and computing efficiency greatly.
