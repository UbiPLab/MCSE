AB This paper describes the medical image information system environment for medical image share. The external interface of this system used a cloud service and we adapted the devices for connections with PACS and smart devices. One problem with this type of approach is the accumulated network latency that can arise from such a deployment. For this reason, we suggested a medical image information system environment using data synchronization methods. Our approach is designed as synchronization methods using detection of creation image data on components of system. Also, we used the cloud computing environment, which reduced the number of high-latency image transmissions. Finally, we show the data synchronization process of the system with imaging application services based on a cloud-computing service. Also, we evaluated the response time to compare to mobile PACS. The experimental results show that our system outperforms mobile PACS. As results, our approach is shown to deliver on par or even better results.
