   monitoring and post-disaster rescue
AB Geological disaster monitoring and warning and post-disaster rescue system support is an important means to improve the ability of coping with geological disaster actively. Geological disasters are aggravating increasingly along with engineering construction and excessive development of resources, thus it is necessary to utilize reasonable monitoring technology for scientific prevention. The article begins with constructing main key technologies of geological disaster real-time monitoring and warning system and post-disaster rescue system, summarizes main features of new-generation information technology, proposes the clews and methods of solving monitoring data acquisition, remote wireless transmission, architecture optimization and integration, quick mining of key data, post-disaster rescue system and systematic management of rescue supplies based on technologies like Internet of things (IOT), new-generation information technology, cloud computing, mega data, and discusses the realization scheme of key technologies such as integration of RFID technology and sensor network technology and expert decision-making model. As has been proved by practice, the said technology is feasible and systems are well reliable and advanced, which are able to provide considerable technological support for disaster reduction and prevention decision-making.
