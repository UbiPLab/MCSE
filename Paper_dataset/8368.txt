AB The ever-growing data traffic volume inside data centers caused by the popularization of cloud services and edge computing demands scalable and cost-efficient network infrastructures. With this premise, optical interconnects have recently gained more and more research attention as a key building block to ensure end-to-end energy efficient solutions, offering high throughput, low latency and reduced energy consumption compared to current networks based on active optical cables. An efficient way for performing such optical interconnects is to make use of multi-core fibers (MCFs), which enables the multiplexing of several spatial channels, each using a different core inside the same fiber cladding. Moreover, non-orthogonal multiple access combined with multi-band carrierless amplitude and phase modulation (NOMA-CAP) has been recently proposed as a potential candidate to increase the network capacity and an efficiency/flexibility resource management. In this paper, using direct detection we experimentally demonstrate the transmission of NOMA-CAP signals through a 2 km MCF with 7 spatial channels for high capacity optical interconnect applications. The results show negligible transmission penalty for different total aggregated traffics ranging from 350 Gb/s to 630 Gb/s.
