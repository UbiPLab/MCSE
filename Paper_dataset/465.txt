AB We propose a blockchain-based, distributed protocol for enabling the deployment of Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks on-demand on top of IoT devices. Specifically, the proposed protocol leverages blockchain technology to: 1) enable distributed and secure authentication, registration, and management of participatory IoT devices; 2) provide fast discovery of IoT resources and scalable and secure instantiation of IoT networks-on-demand; and 3) manage payment operations and ensure reliable fund transfers among the network entities. The proposed protocol relies on a peer-to-peer network communication infrastructure to allow communications among the IoT devices in a distributed manner and uses a self-recovery/self-healing mechanism to ensure robustness against device failure and maliciousness. The protocol also introduces and uses a reputation system to monitor registered devices to keep track of their service delivery quality so that their service delivery reputations could be leveraged for future device selection and mapping. We implemented and evaluated the proposed protocol intensively using simulations and showed that it scales well with network parameters, is resilient to faulty devices, and is robust to 51% attack.
