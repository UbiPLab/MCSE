AB The feasibility and popularity of mobile healthcare are currently increasing. The advancement of modern technologies, such as wireless communication, data processing, the Internet of Things, cloud, and edge computing, makes mobile healthcare simpler than before. In addition, the deep learning approach brings a revolution in the machine learning domain In this paper, we investigate a voice pathology detection system using deep learning on the mobile healthcare framework. A mobile multimedia healthcare framework is also designed. In the voice pathology detection system, voices are captured using smart mobile devices. Voice signals are processed before being fed to a convolutional neural network (CNN). We use a transfer learning technique to use the existing robust CNN models. In particular, the VGG-16 and CaffeNet models are investigated in the paper. The Saarbrucken voice disorder database is used in the experiments. Experimental results show that the voice pathology detection accuracy reaches up to 97.5% using the transfer learning of CNN models.
