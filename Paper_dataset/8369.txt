AB In order to improve the adaptive management ability of virtual machine placement in cloud computing, an adaptive management and multi-objective optimization method for virtual machine placement in cloud computing is proposed based on particle swarm optimization (PSO). The objective optimization model of adaptive management of virtual machine placement in cloud computing is constructed by particle swarm evolution, and the global optimization control of adaptive management of virtual machine placement in cloud computing is carried out by introducing extremum perturbation operator. The global dynamic objective function of particle swarm optimization is constructed, and the global optimal solution of virtual machine in cloud computing is found by deconvolution algorithm, and the optimal position of particle swarm is searched in two-dimensional space. The multi-objective optimization problem of adaptive management of virtual machine placement is transformed into particle swarm optimization problem to realize adaptive management and multi-objective optimization of virtual machine placement in cloud computing. Simulation results show that the adaptive management of virtual machine placement in cloud computing using this method has better global optimization ability, better convergence of particle swarm optimization, and better performance of multi-objective optimization.
