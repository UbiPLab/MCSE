AB Cloud computing is a paradigm where technological resources are distributed globally and internet information is stored, allowing access until recently unthinkable services by paying for consumption. This new paradigm has strengthened new trends such as E-science. The biggest challenge in these trends E-science platforms on private cloud computing are security and privacy problems caused by its multi-tenant nature and processes of virtualization. In this collaborative work may occur intrusions, irreparable damage or illegal access to sensitive and critical users of academic and research ecosystem data. This work, applied for CECAD of UDFJC Bogota, proposes specifying an architectural security model that allows organizations wishing to undertake projects of private cloud, strengthen security and minimize risk exposure that these weaknesses involved.
