AB Some cloud services may be invalid since they are located in a dynamically changing network environment. Service substitution is necessary when a cloud service cannot be used. Existing work mainly concerned on service function and quality in service substitution. To select a more suitable substitutive service, process collaboration similarity needs to be considered. This paper proposes a cluster and process collaboration-aware method to achieve service substitution. To compute the process collaboration similarity, we use logic Petri nets to model service processes. All the service processes are transformed into path strings. Service vectors for cloud services are generated by Word2Vec from these path strings. Process collaboration similarity of two cloud services is obtained by computing the cosine value of their service vectors. Meanwhile, similar cloud services are classified as a service cluster. By calculating function similarity and quality matching, a candidate set for services substitution is generated. The service with the highest process collaboration similarity to invalid one in the candidate set is chosen as the substitutive one. Simulation experiments show the proposed method is less time-consuming than traditional methods in finding substitutive service. Meanwhile, the substitutive one has a high cooccurrence rate with neighboring services of the invalid cloud service. Thus, the proposed method is efficient and integrates process collaboration well in service substitution.
