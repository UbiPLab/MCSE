AB Cloud computing is an emerging computing paradigm that allows pervasive access to shared resources and high level services over the Internet. As most of the companies are switching their network onto cloud, it is affecting the overall performance of cloud infrastructure in terms of task scheduling and load balancing. Scheduling the tasks efficiently reduces processing time, helps achieving better utilization of resources and hence provides profits to service providers. Though a lot of work has already been done in this field, yet the scope of betterment exists in terms of embedding the multiple objectives to enhance the performance. This research focuses on prioritizing tasks in such a way that the virtual machines can best utilise the resources and reduce turn-around time. The approach works on multi-objectives, i.e., time frames and job type such that the job with high computation should be assigned to VMs with high processing speed and communication-intensive jobs to VMs with high bandwidth.
