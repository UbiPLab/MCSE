AB A disruptive technology that is influencing not only computing paradigm but every other business is the rise of big data. Internet of Things (loT) applications are considered to be a major source of big data. Such loT applications are in general supported through clouds where data is stored and processed by big data processing systems. In order to improve the efficiency of cloud infrastructure so that they can efficiently support loT big data applications, it is important to understand how these applications and the corresponding big data processing systems will perform in cloud computing environments. However, given the scalability and complex requirements of big data processing system5, an empirical evaluation on actual cloud infrastructure can hinder the development of timely and cost effective loT solutions. Therefore, a simulator supporting MT applications in cloud environment is highly demanded, but such work is still in its infancy. To fill this gap, we have designed and implemented IOTSim which supports and enables simulation of loT big data processing using MapReduce model in cloud computing environment. A real case study validates the efficacy of the simulator. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
