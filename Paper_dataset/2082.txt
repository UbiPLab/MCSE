AB Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) draws much attention in the next generation of mobile networks with high bandwidth and low latency by enabling the IT and cloud computation capacity at the Radio Access Network (RAN). Matching problem between requesting nodes and servicing nodes is studied when a vehicle wants to offload tasks, a MEC-based offloading framework in vehicular networks is proposed, Vehicle can either offload task to MEC sever as V2I link or neighboring vehicle as V2V link. Taking into account the limited and heterogeneous resources, and the diversity of tasks, offloading framework is established as combination auction model, and a multi-round sequential combination auction mechanism is proposed, which consists of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) ranking, task bidding and winners decision. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism can maximize the efficiency of service nodes while increasing the efficiency of requesting vehicles under the constraints of the delay and the capacity.
