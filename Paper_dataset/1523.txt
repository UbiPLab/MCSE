AB The explosive rise of Internet of Things (IoT) systems have notably increased the potential attack surfaces for cybercriminals. Accounting for the features and constraints of IoT devices, traditional security countermeasures can be inefficient in dynamic IoT environments. In this vein, the advantages introduced by software defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) have the potential to reshape the landscape of cybersecurity for IoT systems. To this aim, we provide a comprehensive analysis of security features introduced by NFV and SDN, describing the manifold strategies able to monitor, protect, and react to IoT security threats. We also present lessons learned in the adoption of SDN/NFV-based protection approaches in IoT environments, comparing them with conventional security countermeasures. Finally, we deeply discuss the open challenges related to emerging SDN- and NFV-based security mechanisms, aiming to provide promising directives to conduct future research in this fervent area.
