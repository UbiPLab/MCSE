AB Cloud computing is attracting a lot of traffic on the Internet. Due to the distributed nature of the ad hoc networks, there is no clear path for the communication between nodes. Additionally, there is no centralized or master node to guide the rest of the nodes in the distributed networks. Since the networks are continually expanding, it is vital to mention that there is a substantial increase in the number of attacks. As such, we became interested to consider monitoring the wireless network using cloud. This way, we will be able to deal with varies attacks and to provide better guidance for the networks. In this paper, we propose a new approach for acknowledgement scheme, using a one hop cloud technology, called Cloud Acknowledgement Scheme. This approach strengthens the wireless network by introducing cloud as a monitoring tool as well as to act as a leader node. An efficient cloud provisioning needs a better scheduling scheme. Towards this end, this paper is proposing a new approach to support the short-lived nature of acknowledgment packets in an efficient manner. Our proposed approach constitutes of two developed algorithms that act as one. These scheduling algorithms help to accomplish the purpose of cloud acknowledgment scheme. It is also important and significant to consider the cloud's awareness of energy consumption to reduce the impact on the environment. Towards this end, monitoring energy consumption is achieved by assigning priorities on the given tasks and balancing the performance and the energy of the cloud. The proposed approach is demonstrated and proved as working models using simulations. The results suggest that our proposed approach has the potential to alternate other existing acknowledgement schemes.
