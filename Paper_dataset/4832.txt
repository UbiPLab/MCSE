AB The wide application of cloud computing technology makes supply chain partner share information effectively and increase corporate profits. However, in cloud computing environment, the evaluation process of supply chain partner selection is dynamic and fuzzy, and its evaluation index is uncertain. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a new method combed with rough number, best-worst multicriteria decision-making method (BWM), and compromise ranking method (VIKOR). Firstly, Rough number is used to integrate data from different evaluation matrix. Secondly, rough number improves a new method, BWM, to get RBWM criteria weight methods. Thirdly, the rough numbers are introduced into VIKOR and combined with RBWM to evaluate and sort the supply chain partners. Finally, an example is given to demonstrate the rationality and feasibility of the method.
