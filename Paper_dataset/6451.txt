AB Cloud computing has transpired as a new model for managing and delivering applications as services efficiently. Convergence of cloud computing with technologies such as wireless sensor networking, Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data analytics offers new applications' of cloud services. This paper proposes a cloud-based autonomic information system for delivering Agriculture-as-a-Service (AaaS) through the use of cloud and big data technologies. The proposed system gathers information from various users through preconfigured devices and IoT sensors and processes it in cloud using big data analytics and provides the required information to users automatically. The performance of the proposed system has been evaluated in Cloud environment and experimental results show that the proposed system offers better service and the Quality of Service (QoS) is also better in terms of QoS parameters.
