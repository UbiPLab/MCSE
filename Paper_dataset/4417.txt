AB The Industrial Internet of Things is growing fast. But the rapid growth of IIoT devices raises a number of security concerns, because the IIoT device is weak in defending against malware, and the method of managing a large number of IIoT devices is awkward and inconvenient. This article proposes a multi-level DDoS mitigation framework (MLDMF) to defend against DDoS attacks for IIoT, which includes the edge computing level, fog computing level, and cloud computing level. Software defined networking is used to manage a large number of IIoT devices and to mitigate DDoS attacks in IIoT. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
