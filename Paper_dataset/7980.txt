AB Cloud computing is an attractive solution for managing IT infrastructures due to its numerous beneficiaries such as automatic optimum resource management as well as modern service delivery models. Cloud computing relies on huge energy hungry data centers to supply resources for diverse range of users with dynamic workloads. Hence, reducing the ever-increasing energy consumption of Cloud data centers as well as their carbon footprints is a crucial issue for Cloud providers. This paper takes advantage of dynamic voltage and frequency scaling method as well as consolidation approach to propose a novel fuzzy multi criteria and objective resource management solution. The extensive evaluation of proposed algorithms using Cloudsim simulator shows notable reductions in energy consumption, SLA violation, and number of migrations in comparison with state of the art.
