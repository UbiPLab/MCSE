ID SECURITY ISSUES; CHALLENGES
AB The characteristics of cloud computing including on-demand self-service, resource pooling, and rapid elasticity have made it grow in popularity. However, security concerns still obstruct widespread adoption of cloud computing in the industry. Especially, security risks related to virtual machine make cloud users worry about exposure of their private data in IaaS environment. In this paper, we propose an enhanced trusted cloud computing platform to provide confidentiality and integrity of the user's data and computation. The presented platform provides secure and efficient virtual machine management protocols not only to protect against eavesdropping and tampering during transfer but also to guarantee the virtual machine is hosted only on the trusted cloud nodes against inside attackers. The protocols utilize both symmetric key operations and public key operations together with efficient node authentication model, hence both the computational cost for cryptographic operations and the communication steps are significantly reduced. As a result, the simulation shows the performance of the proposed platform is approximately doubled compared to the previous platforms. The proposed platform eliminates cloud users' worry above by providing confidentiality and integrity of their private data with better performance, and thus it contributes to wider industry adoption of cloud computing.
