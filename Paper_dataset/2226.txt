AB Fog and Cloud computing are ubiquitous computing paradigms based on the concepts of utility and grid computing. Cloud service providers permit flexible and dynamic access to virtualized computing resources on pay-per-use basis to the end users. The users having mobile device will like to process maximum number of applications locally by defining fog layer to provide infrastructure for storage and processing of applications. In case demands for resources are not being satisfied by fog layer of mobile device then job is transferred to cloud for processing. Due to large number of jobs and limited resources, fog is prone to deadlock at very large scale. Therefore, Quality of Service (QoS) and reliability are important aspects for heterogeneous fog and cloud framework. In this paper, Social Network Analysis (SNA) technique is used to detect deadlock for resources in fog layer of mobile device. A new concept of free space fog is proposed which helps to remove deadlock by collecting available free resource from all allocated jobs. A set of rules are proposed for a deadlock manager to increase the utilization of resources in fog layer and decrease the response time of request in case deadlock is detected by the system. Two different clouds (public cloud and virtual private cloud) apart from fog layer and free space fog are used to manage deadlock effectively. Selection among them is being done by assigning priorities to the requests and providing resources accordingly from fog and cloud. Therefore, QoS as well as reliability to users can be provided using proposed framework. Cloudsim is used to evaluate resource utilization using Resource Pool Manager (RPM). The results show the effectiveness of proposed technique.
