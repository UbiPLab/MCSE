AB The rise in cloud computing has highlighted two separate, and often conflicting, needs for states-the need to protect the data of their citizens and the need of law enforcement authorities (LEAs) to access this data as evidence, often stored by service providers across borders. Both the US and European Union (EU) Member States have asserted that their domestic legal processes are adequate to require disclosure of data that may be held overseas or controlled by a foreign service provider. Yet, both the US and the EU have data protection statutes that will potentially block the transfer of data to foreign LEAs pursuant to these domestic legal processes. This article explores these reciprocal conflicts, considers how they may be resolved, and raises new questions about potential conflicts for UK LEAs in light of the UK's withdrawal from the EU in 2020.
