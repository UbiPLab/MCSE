AB With the dramatic development of cloud computing, more and more challenges emerge for storing massive amounts of data. Data repairing is a main technique to provide data availability in the distributed storage system, such as cloud platform, once storage corruption occurs. In cloud storage, the redundant data are commonly stored in different places for better capability of disaster recovery and are transferred through the open channel, such as Internet. Because the data are of great importance for organizations, it is essential to systematically preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the data, which counters threats such as wiretapping, tampering, and pollution attacks. To address these challenges, we put forward a new data repairing paradigm, referred to as efficient and secure data repairing (ESDR) paradigm. In ESDR, the components of the redundant data are distributed to other storage units after being preprocessed and can be collected and reassembled onto the corrupted unit. Following this paradigm, we propose an ESDR scheme by using regenerating code and certificateless signcryption technique. Furthermore, the proposed enc(2)-mac-signcrypt preprocessing promotes security and efficiency notably. Both theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation confirm that this scheme is practical and efficient to secure data repairing in cloud storage. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
