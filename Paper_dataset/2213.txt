AB To solve the kinetic and diffusion problem of surface-type infrared decoy, multi-chaff kinetic models are established and chaff cloud holistic kinetic performance are analyzed under the impact of high speed airflow in this work. Chaffs rotate rapidly during the motion under the impact of high speed airflow. The rotation speed is correlated with lift, position of pressure center and aerodynamic damping. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used to compute the aerodynamic coefficients of chaff. It is found that there exists serious aerodynamic interference which mainly relates to the overlapping area and distance among chaffs during the diffusion of chaff cloud. The chaff wind tunnel test and rocket sled experiment are carried out to verify the credibility of the models in this work. Then, the variation of chaff cloud expectation and extremum are analyzed to achieve the holistic kinetic and diffusing performance of chaff cloud. Simulation results demonstrate that the chaffs diffuse rapidly under the impact of high speed airflow and chaff cloud can be formed rapidly within 0.5 s. The shape of the chaff cloud is similar to cone that forms a certain angle with the horizontal plane and most chaffs focus on the second half.
