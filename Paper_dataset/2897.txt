AB Despite positive attitudes towards augmented reality (AR) technology and the rich consumer experience that the technology offers, AR technology adoption and usage to enhance the customer experience in e -commerce is rather limited. In this research, leveraging on the technology-organization-environment (TOE) theoretical framework, we propose various factors that influence the adoption intention of AR from an organizational perspective. Analysis of organizational adoption of AR for e-commerce will bring out important factors organizations should focus on while considering the implementation of AR technologies to enhance the shopping experience of their consumers. Specifically, the study theorizes the role of technological factors (technological competence and relative advantage), organizational factors (decision-makers' knowledge, financial strength, and top management support), and environmental factors (consumer readiness and competitive pressure) in influencing an organization's adoption of AR for e-commerce. We test the proposed research model via a sample of potential adopters from Singapore, India, and the USA. Results highlight the significant roles of technology competence, relative advantage, top management support, and consumer readiness in influencing an organization' s adoption intention of AR for e-commerce. Implications for research and practice are also discussed.
