AB In current era, the trend of cloud computing is increasing with every passing day due to one of its dominant service i.e. Infrastructure as a service (IAAS), which virtualizes the hardware by creating multiple instances of VMs on single physical machine. Virtualizing the hardware leads to the improvement of resource utilization but it also makes the system over utilized with inefficient performance. Therefore, these VMs need to be migrated to another physical machine using VM consolidation process in order to reduce the amount of host machines and to improve the performance of system. Thus, the idea of placing the virtual machines on some other hosts leads to the proposal of many new algorithms of VM placement. However, the reduced set of physical machines needs the lesser amount of power consumption therefore; in current work the authors have presented a decision making VM placement system based on genetic algorithm and compared it with three predefined VM placement techniques based on classical bin packing. This analysis contributes to better understand the effects of the placement strategies over the overall performance of cloud environment and how the use of genetic algorithm delivers the better results for VM placement than classical bin packing algorithms.
