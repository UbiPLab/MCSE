AB Cloud computing encompasses powerful technology to perform complex computing for large applications. It provides access to various resources from any location with reduced Information Communication Technology overhead, enabling availability and scalability of resources based on consumer needs. Therefore, it has brought a paradigm shift in the way computing services are delivered. However, due to its increasing usage and rising expectations from cloud service provisioning, providing optimal and effective service is becoming an arduous task for service providers. Thus, maintaining quality of service (QoS) through regular monitoring is the utmost priority for the service provider. The key ingredient of managing QoS is a service level agreement (SLA). SLAs form a basis of measuring service quality. The cloud can be leveraged for provisioning e-Learning services to serve millions of users. The e-Learning service providers can enter into a contract with available cloud providers, which is transparent to the learners. Hence, it is critical to focus on the SLAs that need to be formulated and managed by the service providers for consumers of their e-Learning services. The objective of this paper is to propose SLA-based e-Learning service framework. This paper also identifies SLA parameters and related metrics to measure SLAs relevant to the provisioning of the proposed e-Learning service. It also proposes an innovative e-Learning service monitoring framework for managing QoS. This paper further evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed framework by provisioning of e-Learning service on Google App Engine cloud platform. It also presents experimental analysis using response graph in order to monitor associated SLAs in the proposed framework.
