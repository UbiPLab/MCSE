AB The advances of cloud computing, fog computing, and Internet of things (IoT) make industries more prosperous than ever. A wide range of industrial systems such as transportation and manufacturing systems have been developed by integrating cloud computing, fog computing, and IoT infrastructure successfully. However, in this sophisticated system, security and privacy issues are major concerns that hinder the widespread adoptions of these novel techniques. In this paper, we focus on assured data deletion, an issue that is important but received less attention in academia and industry. We first propose a framework to integrate the cloud, the fog, and the things together to manage stored data from industries or individuals. We then focus on secure data deletion in this framework by proposing an assured data deletion scheme that fulfills verifiable data deletion as well as flexible access control over sensitive data. Only data owners and fog devices are involved when deleting cloud data and validating the deletion of these data, which makes the protocol practical due to the features of low latency as well as real-time interaction with fog. The proposed protocol takes advantage of the attribute-based encryption, whose security can be proved under the standard model. The theoretical analysis shows good performance and functionality requirements while the implementation results demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal.
