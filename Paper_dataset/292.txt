AB Today's cloud storage infrastructures typically provide two distinct types of services for hosting files: object storage like Amazon S3 and filesystem storage like Amazon EFS. In practice, a cloud storage user often desires the advantages of both-efficient filesystem operations with a low unit storage price. An intuitive approach to achieving this goal is to combine the two types of services, e.g., by hosting large files in S3 and small files together with directory structures in EFS. Unfortunately, our benchmark experiments indicate that the clients' download performance for large files becomes a severe system bottleneck. In this article, we attempt to address the bottleneck with little overhead by carefully tweaking the usages of S3 and EFS. Guided by two key observations, we design and implement an open-source system called HyCloud. It automatically invokes the data APIs of S3 and EFS on behalf of users, and intelligently schedules the data transfer among S3, EFS and the clients in a distributed manner. Real-world evaluations demonstrate that the unit storage price of HyCloud is close to that of S3, and the filesystem operations are executed as quickly as in EFS in most times (sometimes even more quickly than in EFS).
