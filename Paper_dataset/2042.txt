AB Today, the world is witnessing an exponential growth in the computational capabilities and storage capabilities of mobile devices. This has inspired application developers to create new and interesting applications for mobile devices. The applications have varied resource requirements and mobile devices are heterogeneous in their configurations. The idea of this research is to design a model for resource sharing among mobile devices so that any type of application can be run on a mobile device with the help of other such devices in close geographical proximity. A novel architecture for managing a group of volunteer nodes with unused or underused resources is designed and algorithms that are required for its operation are developed. The purpose of this research is to shift the focus towards futuristic computing paradigm where seamless resource sharing in the network would be feasible with explicitly all mobile nodes and without any dependency on fixed infrastructures. An extensive evaluation of the proposed Explicit Mobile Cloud (EMCloud) has been undertaken for mobile nodes in the network. It includes experience with a prototype that demonstrates EMCloud's performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art Serendipity, OpenNebula, and Eucalyptus prototypes in terms of success rate and average delay for different network density, mobility, network load, and extent of hierarchy.
