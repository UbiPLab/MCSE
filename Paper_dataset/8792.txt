AB Reliable and real time estimation of water pollution is critical in water management information systems. Sometimes professional software (such as DHI's MIKE11) is not available online to run simulations for various pollution scenarios. A system able to accurately assess the concentration of the pollutant at any points along a river in respect to a given pollution scenario was implemented. This system reuses historical offline data resulted from previous executions of MIKE11 software. The pollution scenario consists of a set of user specified input parameters (chainage, pollutant concentration, discharged volume, type of pollutant, etc.). Numerical methods are used to address the problem of multivariate interpolation and compute the result. The validation of the system was done using data from a real scenario on Dembovita river, the obtained results being estimated with a mean percentage error less than 1.3%. To efficiently cope with millions of records, the computing intensive application was deployed on Jelastic Cloud in order to take the advantage of on demand elastic RAM and CPU resources.
