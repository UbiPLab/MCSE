AB Cloud computing is one of the hottest topics in the field of information technology today, which has been likened to the industrial revolution that is taking place in the information industry. Due to the relative transparency of cloud computing, network data security has become one of the main concerns. Based on the introduction of cloud computing concept, the relevant policies and the current mainstream cloud data security defense means were analyzed in this paper. The security status and development of cloud data were studied. And the reference model of cloud computing security was also studied. A questionnaire analysis was conducted. One was the core importance of cloud security, and the other was to recognize the urgency of taking data security defense. The question was subdivided and the scientific analysis with the security model was carried out. The best technical solution of network data security under cloud service was discussed, to further seek the space for improvement.
