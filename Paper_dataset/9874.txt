DE computing; Public Auditing; Third Party Auditor; Verification time
AB Cloud computing is a very familiar term used for the recent development of internet. It is computed in which very large group of remote servers is networked and provide centralized data storage and online access to computer services. Considering Cloud computing, Data security becomes more and more important. When users put their large size of data in the cloud, the data integrity protection is challenging. Public auditing of cloud data storage security is very essential. In the existing system users who share data as a group. In that group, one original user and number of group users. The original user creates data and other user's shares and accesses that data. The TPA (Third Party Auditor) verifies the data and after verification process cloud stores that verified data. TPA will help the data owner to make sure that his data are safe in the cloud and less burdening to the data owner. In the case of a large number of users single TPA can do the verification process it is very much time consuming process. To overcome this problem we modify the existing system. In that users can be grouped and each group has its own third party auditor. In the modified system the verification time is less as compared to the existing system. From the analysis we have identified that modified system is best for cloud environments.
