AB In this paper, we address the problem of reducing Cloud datacenter high energy consumption with minimal Service Level Agreement (SLA) violation. Although there are many energy-aware resource management solutions for Cloud datacenters, existing approaches focus on minimizing energy consumption while ignoring the SLA violation at the time of virtual machine (VM) deployment. Also, they do not consider the types of application running in the VMs and thus may not really reduce energy consumption with minimal SLA violation under a variety of workloads. In this paper, we propose two novel adaptive energy-aware algorithms for maximizing energy efficiency and minimizing SLA violation rate in Cloud datacenters. Unlike the existing approaches, the proposed energy-aware algorithms take into account the application types as well as the CPU and memory resources during the deployment of VMs. To study the efficacy of the proposed approaches, we performed extensive experimental analysis using real-world workload, which comes from more than a thousand PlanetLab VMs. The experimental results show that, compared with the existing energy-saving techniques, the proposed approaches can effectively decrease the energy consumption in Cloud datacenters while maintaining low SLA violation.
