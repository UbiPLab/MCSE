AB Service classification is a key technology in cloud computing research. In order to improve the efficiency and obtain better service of cloud computing system, this paper puts forward a novel service classification algorithm based on data mining technology. Firstly, the current situation of ser-vice classification in the former cloud environment is analyzed and points out the shortcomings, and features of cloud computing services are extracted, and preprocess training set and test set according to the feature vectors, and secondly training set are input to least square support vector machine to learn and to establish classifier of cloud computing services in which the parameters of least square support vector machine are selected by firefly algorithm, finally, simulation experiments are used to analyze the feasibility and superiority of the proposed algorithm. Results show that the proposed algorithm can fast and accurately implement cloud computing services classification, and cloud environment services classification effect is better than other cloud services classification algorithms, so it has higher practical application value.
