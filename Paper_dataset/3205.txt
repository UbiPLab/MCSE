AB The sudden traffic slowdown especially in fast scrolling roads and highways characterized by a scarce visibility is one of the major causes of accidents among motorized vehicles. It can be caused by other accidents, work-in-progress on roads, excessive motorized vehicles especially at peak times and so on. Typically, fixed traffic sensors installed on roads that interact with drivers' mobile App through the 4G network can mitigate such a problem, but unfortunately not all roads and highways are equipped with such devices. In this paper, we discuss a possible alternative solution for addressing such an issue considering mobile traffic sensors directly installed in private and/or public transportation and volunteer vehicles. In this scenario a fast real-time processing of big traffic data is fundamental to prevent accidents. In particular, we discuss an IoT Cloud system for traffic monitoring and alert notification based on OpenGTS and MongoDB. Our IoT Cloud system, besides for private drivers, it is very useful for drivers of critical rescue vehicles such as ambulances. Experiments prove that our system provides acceptable response times that allows drivers to receive alert messages in useful time so as to avoid the risk of possible accidents.
