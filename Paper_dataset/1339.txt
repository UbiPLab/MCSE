AB With the development of the Internet and communication technology, people have requirements for smart home automation, the flexible control of home devices and the convenient access of security data in home network. However, the data's address paths of data are exposed by the frequently access operations that the same or similar data in data storage servers has been required by users. Besides, the content of encrypted data which is based on the accessed address sequence can be inferred by the malicious servers. Thus, how to protect the privacy data during data sharing and save the resources in servers are challenges to be settled in smart home. In this paper, an efficient and security oblivious random access memory (ORAM) structure scheme is proposed to achieve data sharing in smart home, in which the privacy data can be protected by combining the doubly-linked circular info table with confusion operation. In addition, the proxy re-encryption technology implements data sharing between multi-users. The security analysis shows that the proposed scheme meets the security requirements of ORAM and is secure for data sharing in smart home. The performance analysis shows that the structure effectively reduces the communication overhead.
