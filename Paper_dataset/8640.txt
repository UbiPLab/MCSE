AB With the development of Web service of internet technology, more and more teaching functions can be achieved through network. The emergence of online courses adapts to the development trend of internet, and has become a new teaching model. We applied a WIFI-based intelligent PPT technology innovatively combined with Azure-PaaS cloud computing technology, and designed a new type of online course in the aspects of overall structure and teaching function (the realization of online course is established from 3 aspects: learning module, communication module and evaluation module) according to the cognitive assimilation theory, and then analyzed the teaching effect of the university online vocal music course based on Azure-PaaS platform. Results demonstrate that 47.7% of students used this online course platform frequently and 27.3% of students logged in this platform for learning very frequently. These findings indicate the teaching effect of internet-based vocal music course can be improved, and can provide reference for the design of vocal music web courses in Universities.
