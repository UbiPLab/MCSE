AB Objectives We aimed to compare the CT interpretation before and after the implementation of a computerized system for lung nodule detection and measurements in a nationwide lung cancer screening program. Methods Our screening program started in April 2017, with 14 participating institutions. Initially, all CTs were interpreted using interpretation systems in each institution and manual nodule measurement (conventional system). A cloud-based CT interpretation system, equipped with semi-automated measurement and CAD (computer-aided detection) for lung nodules (cloud-based system), was implemented during the project. Positive rates and performances for lung cancer diagnosis based on the Lung-RADS version 1.0 were compared between the conventional and cloud-based systems. Results A total of 1821 (M:F = 1782:39, mean age 62.7 years, 16 confirmed lung cancers) and 4666 participants (M:F = 4560:106, mean age 62.8 years, 31 confirmed lung cancers) were included in the conventional and cloud-based systems, respectively. Significantly more nodules were detected in the cloud-based system (0.76 vs. 1.07 nodule/participant,p < .001). Positive rate did not differ significantly between the two systems (9.9% vs. 11.0%,p = .211), while their variability across institutions was significantly lower in the cloud-based system (coefficients of variability, 0.519 vs. 0.311,p = .018). The Lung-RADS-based sensitivity (93.8% vs. 93.5%,p = .979) and specificity (90.9% vs. 89.6%,p = .132) did not differ significantly between the two systems. Conclusion Implementation of CAD and semi-automated measurement for lung nodules in a nationwide lung cancer screening program resulted in increased number of detected nodules and reduced variability in positive rates across institutions.
