AB Virtualized radio access network (vRAN) architectures and multiple-access edge computing (MEC) systems constitute two key solutions for the emerging Tactile Internet applications and the increasing mobile data traffic. Their efficient deployment, however, requires a careful design tailored to the available network resources and user demand. In this paper, we propose a novel modeling approach and a rigorous analytical framework, MEC-vRAN joint design problem (MvRAN), that minimizes vRAN costs and maximizes MEC performance. Our framework selects jointly the base-station function splits, the fronthaul routing paths, and the placement of MEC functions. We follow a data-driven evaluation method, using topologies of three operational networks and experiments with a typical face-recognition MEC service. Our results reveal that MvRAN achieves significant cost savings (up to 2.5 times) compared to non-optimized centralized RAN or decentralized RAN systems, and MEC pushes the vRAN functions to radio units and hence can increase substantially the network cost.
