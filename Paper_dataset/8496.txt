AB Traditional underground space safety monitoring is ineffective as data continuity is weak, systematic and random errors are prominent, data quantification is difficult, data stability is scarce (especially in bad weather), and it is difficult to guarantee human safety. In this study, BIM technology and multi-data wireless sensor network transmission protocol, cloud computing platform are introduced into engineering monitoring, real-time online monitoring equipment, cloud computing platform and other hardware and software are developed, and corresponding online monitoring system for structural safety is developed to realize online monitoring and early diagnosis of underground space safety. First, the shape of the underground space, the surrounding environment, and various monitoring points are modeled using BIM. Then, the monitoring data collected from sensors at the engineering site are transmitted to the cloud via wireless transmission. Data information management is then realized via cloud computing, and an actual state-change trend and security assessment is provided. Finally, 4D technology (i.e., 3D model + time axis) that leverages a deformation chromatographic nephogram is used to facilitate managers to view deformation and safety of their underground spaces. To overcome past shortcomings, this system supports the management of basic engineering project data and storage of historical data. Furthermore, the system continuously reflects the fine response of each monitoring item under various working conditions all day, which has significant theoretical value and application.
