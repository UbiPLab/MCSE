AB The popularity of mobile applications on smartphones requires mobile devices to perform high-performing processing tasks. The computational resources of these devices are limited due to memory, battery life, heat, and weight dissipation. To overcome the limitations of mobile devices, cloud computing is considered the best solution. The major issues faced by cloud computing are expensive roaming charges and growing demand for radio access. However, some major benefits associated with cloud computing are fast application processing, fast transfer of data, and substantial reduction in the use of mobile resources. This study evaluated the association between the distance of cloud servers and cloudlets with and without coordination and data latency. Fast communication in the cloudlet environment is facilitated by coordinated cloudlets, which have a positive influence on the infrastructure of cloud computing. The coordinated cloudlets can be efficiently accessed in different areas, such as vehicular networks, vehicular fog computing, and fog computing.
