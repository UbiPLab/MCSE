AB Cloud computing is very lucrative technology because of its cost effectiveness, efficiency, flexibility, pay-per-use and scalability. With these advantages, cloud computing has many issues, and some existing issues have become very critical. Access control and security are two critical issues of cloud computing. Access control is a method, which allows a customer or user to access a data, file or any kind of resources from a system. In this paper, a new table based access control model has been proposed for cloud computing environment. The proposed scheme is very efficient because it can minimize many problems, such as high data accessing time, high searching time for providing the public key of the data owner, maintenance of the database, etc. Both the performance analysis and experimental results prove that the proposed scheme is more efficient and effective than the existing schemes.
