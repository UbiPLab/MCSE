AB Cloud computing is an emerging paradigm of Internet-centric business computing where Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) are providing services to the customer according to their needs. The key perception behind cloud computing is on-demand sharing of resources available in the resource pool provided by CSP, which implies new emerging business model. The resources are provisioned when jobs arrive. The job scheduling and minimization of waiting time are the challenging issue in cloud computing. When a large number of jobs are requested, they have to wait for getting allocated to the servers which in turn may increase the queue length and also waiting time. This paper includes system design for implementation which is concerned with Johnson Scheduling Algorithm that provides the optimal sequence. With that sequence, service times can be obtained. The waiting time and queue length can be reduced using queuing model with multi-server and finite capacity which improves the job scheduling model.
