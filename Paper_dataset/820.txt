AB The emergence of cloud computing has been growing rapidly in the last decades especially for workflow scheduling. Organizations with the same requirements and needs go to use the community cloud for saving costs. One of the important challenges of using the community cloud is resource allocation and task scheduling. In this paper, we propose a new Management System for servicing Multi-organizations in a Community cloud (MSMC) in a secure cloud environment. The MSMC employs a virtual machine allocation algorithm to organize the community cloud usage among the organizations, where it allocates the available virtual machines according to the use of each organization in an efficient and fair way to execute the submitted applications. Moreover, the MSMC system proposes a new scheduling algorithm, called Ideal Distribution Algorithm (IDA), to schedule the workflow tasks to the virtual machines of the cloud considering both the deadline and cost constraints. Additionally, an enhanced version of the IDA, called Enhanced IDA (EIDA) is proposed to provide load balancing required by the cloud. The simulation experiments show that the system can improve the system ability under deadline constraints and improve the monetary cost.
