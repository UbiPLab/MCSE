AB In order to fully use Internet of things to solve the agricultural fine production, fertilizer, fine and precise control, full traceability and other bottlenecks, and to solve the quality safety of agricultural products from the source and agriculture environmental pollution, a networking application system for modern agriculture is constructed, and networking intelligent gateway based on open source hardware is designed and developed, which realizes the video monitoring function based on motion detection. In addition, basic cloud platform system for modern agriculture network monitoring system is designed and achieved. Based on the RESTful interface service system provided by cloud platform, ExtJs client technology and WeChat re applied in the development and realization of the Demo system of an application layer. As a result, it shows part of application assumption of agricuture network monitoring system, and designs the big data processing and analysis module. What's more, the Hadoop platform is used to achieve massive data processing produced by applications of Internet of things, and combined with machine learning technology, the corresponding model is established. It is concluded that the best solution is given such as crop variety selection, production and cultivation management and time to market.
