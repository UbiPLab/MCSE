AB Rock bolts are a crucial part of underground infrastructure support; however, current methods to locate and record their positions are manual, time consuming and generally incomplete. This paper describes an effective method to automatically locate supporting rock bolts from a 3D laser scanned point cloud. The proposed method utilises a machine learning classifier combined with point descriptors based on neighbourhood properties to classify all data points as either 'bolt' or 'not-bolt' before using the Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to divide the results into candidate bolt objects. The centroids of these objects are then computed and output as simple georeferenced 3D coordinates to be used by surveyors, mine managers and automated machines. Two classifiers were tested, a random forest and a shallow neural network, with the neural network providing the more accurate results. Alongside the different classifiers, different input feature types were also examined, including the eigenvalue based geometric features popular in the remote sensing community and the point histogram based features more common in the mobile robotics community. It was found that a combination of both feature sets provided the strongest results. The obtained precision and recall scores were 0.59 and 0.70 for the individual laser points and 0.93 and 0.86 for the bolt objects. This demonstrates that the model is robust to noise and misclassifications, as the bolt is still detected even if edge points are misclassified, provided that there are enough correct points to form a cluster. In some cases, the model can detect bolts which are not visible to the human interpreter.
