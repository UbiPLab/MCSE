AB Medical images are used daily to support diagnosis in different areas of Radiology throughout the world. However, there is a great need for these images to be analyzed by different specialists and widely discussed in the search for the best treatment for each pathology. In clinical environments transmit these images in a timely manner is a problem without spontaneous solution. The unavailability of real-time data for specialized medical evaluation directly impacts therapeutic success. The cloud computing model has the characteristics necessary to ensure that these images can be within the reach of professionals able to offer the best service. This paper presents the PS2DICOM model that establishes communication in hospital networks and uses the Publish/Subscribe paradigm in two levels of scalability. The PS2DICOM model is a middleware that acts on the IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) layer, supporting the tasks of transmitting and storing files within the DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine). The system also offers data compression adaptive to the available bandwidth. The research contributes to presenting an efficient architecture to optimize network tasks, capable of being adopted as a solution when developing applications aimed at hospital networks. The architecture was tested using a prototype with distinct modules, developed for each specific service offered and proved to be effcient as a solution to the problems in question.
