AB The key to the explosion of the Internet of Things and the ability to collect, analyze, and provide big data in the cloud is edge computing, which is a new computing paradigm in which data is processed from edges. Edge Computing has been attracting attention as one of the top 10 strategic technology trends in the past two years and has innovative potential. It provides shorter response times, lower bandwidth costs, and more robust data safety and privacy protection than cloud computing. In particular, artificial intelligence technologies are rapidly incorporating edge computing. In this paper, we introduce the concepts, backgrounds, and pros and cons of edge computing, explain how it operates and its structure hierarchically with artificial intelligence concepts, list examples of its applications in various fields, and finally suggest some improvements and discuss the challenges of its application in three representative technological fields. We intend to clarify various analyses and opinions regarding edge computing and artificial intelligence.
