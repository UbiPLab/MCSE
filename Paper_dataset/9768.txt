AB Cloud technology uses MapReduce to make computers quickly process a huge amount of data with plentiful resources in clouds, but requires that applications should be developed or reprogrammed to process data in a batch mode of MapReduce. By our solution addressed in this paper, cloud technology no longer poses application writers because our ASPECT solution can: (1) free application writers from burdens of developing or reprogramming an application in the MapReduce programming model; (2) keep the existing application processing data as usual without switching to the batch mode of processing data in MapReduce, and (3) speed up the execution of the application in clouds by reusing or sharing run-time data with other instances of the application.
