AB Due to the fact that cloud computing bring with them new challenges in the field of information security, it is imperative for organizations to control the process of information risk management in the cloud. This paper proposes a risk assessment approach for assessing the potential damage from the attack on the implementation of components of confidential data and justify the need for the inclusion of private clouds with a high degree of protection in a hybrid cloud computing environment. Suggested approach to information security risk estimation allows conduction of cloud environment security functioning in conditions of considered vulnerability class influence and also an effectiveness of measure and facility complex to withstand these vulnerabilities. On the basis of received estimation an opportunity to choose between different variants of cloud computing environment configuration and choose more appropriate way according to security requirements arises.
