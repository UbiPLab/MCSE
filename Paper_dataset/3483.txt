AB Cloud computing allows engineers to rapidly develop complex systems and deploy them continuously, at global scale. This can create unique reliability risks. Cloud infrastructure providers are constantly developing new ideas and incorporating them into their products and services in order to increase the reliability of their platforms. Cloud application developers can also employ a number of architectural techniques and operational best practices to further boost the availability of their systems.
