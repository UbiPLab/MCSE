AB We study the problem of dynamically migrating a service in the cloud to satisfy an online sequence of mobile batch-request demands in a cost-effective way. The service may have single or multiple replicas, each running on a virtual machine. As the origin of mobile accesses frequently changes over time, this problem is particularly important for time-bounded services to achieve enhanced Quality of Service and cost effectiveness. Moving the service closer to the client locations not only reduces the service access latency but also minimizes the network costs for service providers. However, these benefits are not free. The migration comes at a cost of bulk-data transfer and service disruption, and hence, increasing the overall service costs. To gain the benefits of service migration while minimizing the caused monetary costs, we propose an efficient search-based algorithm Dmig to migrate a single server, and then extend it as a scalable algorithm, called mDmig, to the multi-server situation, a more general case in the cloud. Both algorithms are fully distributed, symmetric, and characterized by the effective use of historical access information to conduct virtual migration so that the limitations of local search in the cost reduction can be overcome. To evaluate the algorithms, we compared them with some existing algorithms and an off-line algorithm. Our simulation results showed that the proposed algorithms exhibit better performance in service migration by adapting to the changes of mobile access patterns in a cost-effective way.
