AB With the development of cloud computing, the integrity of data is becoming increasingly important. The auditing schemes for data integrity allow data owners to verify the integrity of the data stored in an untrusted server. Most public auditing schemes are based on the public key infrastructure (PKI), which may lead to certificate management problems. Recently, an identity-based public auditing scheme was proposed and it could effectively reduce computation cost of auditors and solve certificate management problems. However, the scheme was proved to be insecure. In this paper, we consider the malicious auditor and propose a new identity-based public auditing against malicious auditor in the cloud computing. The new construction is proved to be secure by assuming the hardness of the computation Diffie-Hellman problem (CDHP). Finally, compared with the existing identity-based auditing scheme, our scheme is efficient and it reduces the computation overhead of the auditor.
