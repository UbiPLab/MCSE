AB Security is one of the main concerns in the cloud computing platforms. To improve the cloud security various secure scheduling algorithms have been proposed in the literature which tries to improve the assignment of the cloud VMs to the workflow tasks. In this paper, a secure workflow scheduling scheme is provided based on the newly proposed Symbiotic Organism Search (SOS) meta-heuristic algorithm designed to solve numerical optimization problems. Our proposed secure workflow scheduling solution mainly tries to mitigate the makespan and the execution cost of the workflow execution and reduces the difference between the tasks requested security level and the VMs security level assigned for them. The extensive simulations exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed SOS-based secure workflow scheduling scheme against the PSO-based workflow scheduling in various scenarios.
