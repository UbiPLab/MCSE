AB Cloud Application Security has become a key concern in the recent years since all industries are marching towards cloud technology. There are several concerns in providing a secure environment to many sectors such as finance, healthcare using cloud-computing environment. The primary concern is to provide secured access for cloud-based applications. There are many existing solutions in use such as One Time Password (OTP) for secure access. But, in present scenario, the two important issues that has to be addressed is (i) the One Time Password (OTP) has to be encrypted before sending to the end users (ii) the authentication time for login is should be reduced in order to keep the authentication process secure. This research work proposes an encryption algorithm for OTP generation mechanism based on the user credential for Cloud based Secure Electronic Health Record System (CSEHRS) for securing medical records. Hence, this paper addresses how to provide a secure OTP using Message Digit 5 (MD5) algorithm to the end user based on short message service (SMS). This system takes minimum time to complete the secure login process that includes generating and sending the OTP through SMS. This proposed framework was developed as a prototype and experiments were conducted to analyses the efficiency of the different service provider in CSEHRS.
