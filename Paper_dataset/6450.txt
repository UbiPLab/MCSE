AB The [C2H]/[C2D] abundance ratio is a useful tool to explore the physical and chemical conditions of cold molecular clouds. Hence, an accurate determination of both the C2H and C2D abundances is of fundamental interest. Due to the low density of the interstellar medium, the population of the energy levels of the molecules is not at local thermodynamical equilibrium. Thus, the accurate modelling of the emission spectra requires the calculation of collisional rate coefficients with the most abundant interstellar species. Hence, we provide rate coefficients for the hyperfine excitation of C2H and C2D by para-H-2(j= 0), the most abundant collisional partner in coldmolecular clouds. State-to-state rate coefficients between the lowest levels were computed for temperatures ranging from 5 to 80 K. For both isotopologues, the Delta j = Delta F propensity rule is observed. The comparison between C2H and C2D rate coefficients shows that differences by up to a factor of two exist, mainly for Delta j = Delta N = 1 transitions. The new rate coefficients will significantly help in the interpretation of recent observed spectra.
