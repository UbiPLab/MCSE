AB The cloud computing presents a type of assignments and systems which occupy distributed resources to execute a role in a distributed way. Cloud computing make use of the online systems on the web to assist the implementation of complicated assignments; that need huge-scale computation. It was said with the intention of in our living world; we can find it challenging to balance workloads of cloud computing among assignments (jobs or tasks) and systems (machines or nodes), so the majority of the time we have to promote a condition to unbalanced assignment problems (unequal task allocations). The present article submits a new technique to solve the unequal task allocation problems. The technique is offered in an algorithmic model and put into practice on the several groups of input to investigate the presentation and usefulness of the works. An evaluation is prepared with the presented approach. It makes sure that the proposed approach provides a better outcome by comparing with some other existing algorithms.
