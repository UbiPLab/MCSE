AB Motivated by many networked computing systems used in data centers, Grid or Cloud computing infrastructures, and spatially distributed wireless sensor networks configured in aerospace and military industries, this paper considers a multi-state series-parallel system where n heterogeneous components can possess multiple states with different performance rates. Performability is concerned with the probability of such a system performing at a cumulative system performance W characterized in terms of the minimum of all cumulative subsystem performance G(j) (1 <= j <= m), G(j) is the sum of the performance rates of components belonging to the jth subsystem. This paper proposes a multi-valued decision diagram (MDD)-based approach to model and evaluate the concerned performability. A single compact MDD model is constructed by sharing all isomorphic model structures involved in different cumulative system performance. The MDD model can be reused when different versions of component state probability distributions are evaluated, thus it can facilitate solutions to further problems that require executing numerous iterations of performability evaluations, for example, the redundancy and/or reliability optimization problems.
