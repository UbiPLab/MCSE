AB In order to apply cloud computing to study visual communication design, high-resolution remote sensing image features and applications were analyzed. A high-resolution remote sensing image storage model in the cloud computing environment was designed. Afterward, deep analysis and comparison were made toward the current mainstream cloud platform. Based on the characteristics of high-resolution remote sensing images, the key technologies in the design of high-resolution remote sensing image storage model in cloud computing environment were discussed. The results showed that the integration of cloud platform Hadoop and virtualization management cloud platform provided corresponding transparent use of distributed computing resources for different remote sensing image applications. Therefore, this method provides a new way for other industries to apply cloud computing environments.
