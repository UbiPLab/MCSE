AB Standby power refers to the electric power consumed by electronic appliances while they are in a standby mode. As the electronic appliance have become smarter, they consume more standby power. To reduce wasted electricity, techniques to save standby power have been developed in conjunction with network and communication technologies. Automatic standby power saving systems have been developed, but the proposed systems do not consider the cost reduction, user satisfaction, and personalized environment. Furthermore, to provide automation, an intelligent system for collected information is required, which increases the cost of system integration. Therefore, this paper proposes cloud based on-demand standby power management using consumer pattern racking to address these problems to deal with these issues. The proposed system offers rule based management services with three usage types determined by user preferences and living patterns. The total power consumption is measured to verify the performance of the system. The proposed system reduces the power consumption up to 9.3%(1).
