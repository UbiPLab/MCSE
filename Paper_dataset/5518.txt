AB Owing to the large number of professional glossaries and unknown patent classification, analysts usually fail to collect and analyze patents efficiently. One solution to this problem is to conduct patent analysis using a patent classification system. However, in a corpus such as cloud patents, many keywords are common among different classes, making it difficult to classify the unknown class documents using the machine learning techniques proposed by previous studies. To remedy this problem, this study aims to establish an efficient classification system with a special focus on features extraction and application of extension theory. We first propose a compound method to determine the features, and then, we propose an extension-based classification method to develop an efficient patent classification system. Using cloud computing patents as the database, the experimental results show that our proposed scheme can outperform the classification quality of the traditional classifiers.
