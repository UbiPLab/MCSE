AB As more and more services are deployed in the cloud datacenter, network traffic is growing exponentially. Virtual machines (VMs) of a virtual cluster (VC) must be allocated on physical machines (PMs) in the datacenter with a certain topology. Each VM needs some resources to run various services. Apparently, allocating VMs in the datacenter as compactly as possible can reduce traffic consumption and avoid bandwidth-related bottlenecks. However, loose allocation scheme can reduce the loss expectation of VMs due to failure possibilities of PMs and switches, and the availability of the VC is increased thereby. To enhance availability and reduce network bandwidth usage, it is significant to determine the scheme of allocating VMs of the VC. In this paper, we first introduce four typical datacenter architectures with network topologies and corresponding cost matrices, and extend to generality. Then we propose a joint optimization function to measure the risk of VC and the core bandwidth usage with a global availability constraint. Subsequently, an evolutionary algorithm is raised to minimize the value of the constrained optimization function. Finally, the evaluation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach and performance advancement over the existing approaches.
