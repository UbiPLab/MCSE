AB Cloud computing is a model which pays to easy availability, distributed and comprehensive aggregation computing resources and configurable common computing. In cloud computing, abilities based on information technology can be accessible as the service that doesn't need accurate knowledge based on structural technologies and with less management effort. Regarding to this, one of the most important issues will be the security issue for novel technologies. So we tried to review these security affairs and we emphasize that even there are several security enhancement approaches, but a comprehensive cloud computing approach should be presented in IT world. Availability of data and information privacy and services in cloud computing area cannot solve the security of cloud computing and new strategies and technologies should be used together for protection of total system. The data security and privacy issue in cloud environment is more important rather than the usual network because the information in cloud computing environment is significantly related to the network and server. In this regard these problems had been caught up the enhancement in cloud computing area and also security affairs are considered as the main problem.
