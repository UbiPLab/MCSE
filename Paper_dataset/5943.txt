AB In data centers, large numbers of computers are run simultaneously. These computers consume an enormous amount of energy. Several challenges related to this issue have been published. An energy-efficient storage management method that cooperates with applications was one effective approach. In this method, data and storage devices are managed using application support and the power consumption of storage devices is significantly decreased. However, existing studies do not take the virtualized environment into account. Recently, many data-intensive applications have been run in a virtualized environment, such as the cloud computing environment. In this paper, we focus on a virtualized environment wherein multiple virtual machines run on a physical computer and a data intensive application runs on each virtual machine. We discuss a method for reducing storage device power consumption using application support. First, we propose two storage management methods using application information. One method optimizes the inter-HDD file layout. This method removes frequently-accessed files from a certain HDD and switches the HDD to power-off mode. To balance loads and reduce seek distances, this method separates a heavily accessed file and consolidates files in a virtual machine with low access frequency. The other method optimizes the intra-HDD file layout, in addition to performing inter-HDD optimization. This method places frequently accessed files near each other. Second, we present our experimental results and demonstrate that the proposed methods can create sufficiently long HDD access intervals that power-off mode can be used, and thereby, reduce the power consumption of storage devices.
