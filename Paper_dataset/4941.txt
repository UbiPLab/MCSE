ID SERVICES; STORAGE
AB Cloud storage, one of the core services of cloud computing, provides an effective way to solve the problems of storage and management caused by high-speed data growth. Thus, a growing number of organizations and individuals tend to store their data in the cloud. However, due to the separation of data ownership and management, it is difficult for users to check the integrity of data in the traditional way. Therefore, many researchers focus on developing several protocols, which can remotely check the integrity of data in the cloud. In this paper, we propose a novel public auditing protocol based on the adjacency-hash table, where dynamic auditing and data updating are more efficient than those of the state of the arts. Moreover, with such an authentication structure, computation and communication costs can be reduced effectively. The security analysis and performance evaluation based on comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our protocol can achieve all the desired properties and outperform the state-of-the-art ones in computing overheads for updating and verification.
