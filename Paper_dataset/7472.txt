AB In cloud computing environments, resources stored on the cloud servers are transmitted in the form of data flow to the clients via networks. Due to the real-time and ubiquitous requirements of cloud computing services, how to design a sophisticated transmission model to ensure service reliability and security becomes a key problem. In this paper, we first propose a Comprehensive Transmission (CT) model, by combining the Client/Server (CAS) mode and the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) mode for reliable data transmission. Then, we design a Two-Phase Resource Sharing (TPRS) protocol, which mainly consists of a pre-filtering phase and a verification phase, to efficiently and privately achieve authorized resource sharing in the CT model. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the synthetic data set to verify the feasibility of our protocol. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
