AB Loading balance is one of the most important problems in computer cloud environment because it needs to optimize task scheduling. The environment of cloud computing is not sufficient to give good quality for user's service because the tasks schedule and allocation are not of the same loads. In this paper a new strategy is proposed to balance the loads using swarm Bat Algorithm (BA). Bat algorithm behaviour uses echolocation to detect their prey for creating load balancing model. The proposed strategy depends on Naive-Bayes algorithm to classify virtual machines (VMs) that is used to update the migrated task for the information used by the bats. The migrated tasks assigned heavy loaded VMs to light loaded VM providing numbers of tasks have lowest priority in task's queue. The tasks from heavy-loaded migrated virtual machines are migrating to lighted-loaded virtual machine, it is found that tasks have high-priority from minimizing of services in VM and avoid tasks have large number of services are scheduled to the same VM. The experimental results on loading balance bat algorithm (LBBA) were compared with traditional algorithms such as Dynamic load balance (DLB)or round robin (RR). It is clear that the LBBA is performing well better in regard to less response, completion, and migration times than the traditional methods. Further, the requirements of user's service quality are best matched.
