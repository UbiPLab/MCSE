AB In this paper we propose an architecture for a city-wide traffic modeling and prediction service based on the Fog Computing paradigm. The work assumes an scenario in which a number of distributed antennas receive data generated by vehicles across the city. In the Fog nodes data is collected, processed in local and intermediate nodes, and finally forwarded to a central Cloud location for further analysis. We propose a combination of a data distribution algorithm, resilient to back-haul connectivity issues, and a traffic modeling approach based on deep learning techniques to provide distributed traffic forecasting capabilities. In our experiments, we leverage real traffic logs from one week of Floating Car Data (FCD) generated in the city of Barcelona by a road-assistance service fleet comprising thousands of vehicles. FCD was processed across several simulated conditions, ranging from scenarios in which no connectivity failures occurred in the Fog nodes, to situations with long and frequent connectivity outage periods. For each scenario, the resilience and accuracy of both the data distribution algorithm, and the learning methods were analyzed. Results show that the data distribution process running in the Fog nodes is resilient to back-haul connectivity issues and is able to deliver data to the Cloud location even in presence of severe connectivity problems. Additionally, the proposed traffic modeling and forecasting method exhibits better behavior when run distributed in the Fog instead of centralized in the Cloud, especially when connectivity issues occur that force data to be delivered out of order to the Cloud.
