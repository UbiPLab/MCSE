AB Task scheduling in the cloud platform seems to be the most significant issue to guarantee that cloud connectivity adequately and efficiently meets the requirements of customers. Scheduling is basically the method of mapping or assigning tasks after taking into account job features to accessible funds. An effective scheduling protocol should comply with user needs and aids a service provider perform excellent quality of service (QoS) in order to boost general application efficiency. Cloud computing is an evolving computational paradigm with a broad range of self-reliant and economically diverse computational structures. Task scheduling is a significant move to enhance cloud computing general efficiency. Task scheduling is also important in order to decrease power utilization and enhance service providers' profitability through a reduction in handling moment. In this paper we suggest a chaotic squirrel search algorithm (CSSA) to optimally multitask scheduling in an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud atmosphere. The methods continuously generate job plans that render the current approaches more cost-effective. In order to guarantee greater global convergence, the early eco system was produced with messy optimisation for the efficient eco-system. The suggested chaotic squirrel search algorithm was ultimately synthesised with the messy local search to enable the exploring authority to complement Squirrel search algorithm (SSA) algorithms. Other QoS conditions such as compatibility and safety for very big cases can be expanded to cover the suggested technique. A cloud simulator toolkit takes into consideration the strategy and compares the outcomes with scheduling algorithms so that ideal outcomes for several goals are achieved.
