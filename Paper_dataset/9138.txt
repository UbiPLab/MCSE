AB In the current networking field many research works are going on regarding the integration of different wireless technologies, with the aim of providing uninterrupted connectivity to the user anywhere, with high data rates due to increased demand. However, the number of objects like smart devices, industrial machines, smart homes, connected by wireless interface is dramatically increasing due to the evolution of cloud computing and internet of things technology. This Paper begins with the challenges involved in such integrations and then explains the role of different couplings and different architectures. This paper also gives further improvement in the LTE and Wimax integration architectures to provide seamless vertical handover and flexible quality of service for supporting voice, video, multimedia services over IP network and mobility management with the help of IMS networks. Evaluation of various parameters like handover delay, cost of signalling, packet loss,, is done and the performance of the interworking architecture is analysed from the simulation results. Finally, it concludes that the cross layer scenario is better than the non cross layer scenario. (C) 2016 Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.
