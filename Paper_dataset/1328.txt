AB This article aims to study the strategic transformative value dimensions of cloud computing. Organizational requirements, managerial strategic objectives, and their attendant challenges are very specific indicators that enable characterization of these dimensions. An exploratory study of 173 cases of companies, covering 17 distinct economic activity sectors, spread over all continents, was conducted, taking into account contingency factors such as culture, size, and structure. The elements of industry, strategy, and technology were also considered, as well as managerial cognition. The analyses of needs, objectives, challenges, implemented solutions, and results of the transformation to cloud computing, enabled us to identify these dimensions. Strategies to maximize the transformative value of cloud computing are then presented. The results of this study can be used by managers to facilitate and optimize this cloud computing transformation.
