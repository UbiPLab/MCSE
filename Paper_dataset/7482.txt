AB While the proliferation of cloud services have greatly impacted our society, how green are these services is yet to be answered. Although, demand escalation for green services has grown due to societal awareness, the approaches to provide green services and establish Green SLAs remain oblivious for cloud or infrastructure providers. The main challenge for cloud provider is to manage Green SLAs with their customers while satisfying their business objectives, such as maximizing profits by lowering expenditure for green energy. Since, Green SLA needs to be proposed based on the presence of green energy, the intermittent nature of renewable sources makes it difficult to be achieved. In response, this paper presents a scheme for green energy management in the presence of explicit and implicit integration of renewable energy in data center. More specifically we propose three contributions: i) we introduce the concept of virtualization of green energy to address the uncertainty of green energy availability, ii) we extend the Cloud Service Level Agreement (CSLA) language to support Green SLA by introducing two new threshold parameters and iii) we introduce greenSLA algorithm which leverages the concept of virtualization of green energy to provide per interval specific Green SLA. Experiments were conducted with real workload profile from PlanetLab and server power model from SPECpower to demonstrate that, Green SLA can be successfully established and satisfied without incurring higher cost.
