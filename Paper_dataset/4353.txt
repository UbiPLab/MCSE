AB Private cloud infrastructures are now widely deployed and adopted across technology industries and research institutions. Although cloud computing has emerged as a reality, it is now known that a single cloud provider cannot fully satisfy complex user requirements. This has resulted in a growing interest in developing hybrid cloud solutions that bind together distinct and heterogeneous cloud infrastructures. In this paper we describe the orchestration approach for heterogeneous clouds that has been implemented and used within the INDIGO-DataCloud project. This orchestration model uses existing open-source software like OpenStack and leverages the OASIS Topology and Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) open standard as the modeling language. Our approach uses virtual machines and Docker containers in an homogeneous and transparent way providing consistent application deployment for the users. This approach is illustrated by means of two different use cases in different scientific communities, implemented using the INDIGO-DataCloud solutions.
