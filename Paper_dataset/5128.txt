AB At present, teachers and students are unable to communicate with each other directly in the network courses so that the teaching quality has been compromised. Moreover, teaching process becomes slow in traditional teaching mode of network course. In this project, we introduced an innovative PBL (Problem Based Learning) teaching method and combined teacher and student interaction for a network course, while utilizing cloud computing In addition, all workstations were card workstations to reduce the delay of teaching task. We designed a platform with a personnel information module and a learning service module. The learning service module covers three mam functions teaching service resources management, online coaching, and assignment submission and correctio.n The evaluation outcome shows that the learning outcome and learning interest was superior for students who used the PBL network teaching platform, compared to the students who didn't use this platform.
