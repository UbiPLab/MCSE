AB Development of smart city and smart industry is a major concern in today's world. By using the Internet of Things and big data analytics, can develop the smart city and smart industry. So a new approach called smart city industry based on big data (SCIB) is proposed. This helps to enhance the performance and to develop the smart city and smart industry even by using big data analytics. Here data are collected from the smart city and industrial appliances such as health care, education systems, congestion management and power grid. These data will be formed as a big data and that will be passed to data acquisition for digitalization. Further it will be stored with the help of cloud computing process. Now based on the application user's requirement data processing, decision making and data transfer process will be done. In simulation section, it analyzes the performance and calculates the parameters such as delay, lifetime, failure rate, congestion rate and throughput to know the performance of the proposed approach. The proposed SCIB approach will help to increase the throughput and lifetime at the same time it reduces the delay, failure rate and congestion rate.
