AB Power consumption and associated carbon emissions are increasingly critical challenges for large-scale computing. Recent research proposes exploiting stranded power-uneconomic renewable power-for green supercomputing in a system called Zero-Carbon Cloud (ZCCloud) [11, [2], [3]. These efforts studied production supercomputing workloads on stranded-power based computing resources, demonstrating their achievable productivity. We explore economic viability of stranded-power based supercomputing, using three datacenter total-cost-of-ownership (TOO) models to study cost-effectiveness. These studies show that ZCCloud's approach can be cost-effective in the USA today, and is even more attractive in regions with higher power prices (e.g., Japan, Germany), achieving cost advantages as large as 50 percent. Environmental and power-grid benefits are a further advantage. We also explore the sensitivity of these results to changes in hardware TOO; cheaper hardware or longer lifetimes magnify the attractiveness of stranded-power based approaches, yielding advantages as large as 91 percent. These results are robust across different TCO models. Finally, we study extreme-scale supercomputers ( >100 MW), finding stranded-power can increase peak capability per cost by as much as 80 percent.
