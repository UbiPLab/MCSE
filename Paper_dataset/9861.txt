AB In order to improve the customer service quality during the virtual machine (VM) migration process in networks, a multi-VM parallel migration strategy based on Markov chain is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the simulation experiment is carried out to provide the data regarding the influence of the algorithm parameters on blocking probability, network migration time and downtime. According to the simulation result, under the condition of the same algorithm parameters, the multi-VM parallel migration process has low parallel downtime, and this index can significantly influence user experience improvement, thus indicating the advantage of the parallel strategy for improving user experience. Meanwhile, under the condition of the same parameters, the network blocking probability of the multi-VM parallel migration process is obviously lower than that of the sequence migration process, thus indicating that the parallel process has higher network utilization. Moreover, the network parameters can be properly selected according to actual needs.
