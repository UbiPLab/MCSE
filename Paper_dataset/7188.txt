AB Migration to the cloud computing environment is a strategic organizational decision. Using a reliable framework for migration ensures managers to mitigate risks in the cloud computing technology. Therefore, organizations always search for cloud migration frameworks with dynamic nature as well as integrity beside their simplicity. In previous studies, these important features have received less attention and have not been achieved in an integrated and comprehensive way. The aim of this study is to use a meta-synthesis method for the first time for analysis and synthesis of previous published studies and suggests a comprehensive cloud migration framework. We review more than 657 papers from relevant journals and conference proceedings. The concepts which are extracted from these papers are classified to related sub-categories and categories. Then, our proposed framework based on these concepts and categories is developed. It includes seven main phases (categories) and fifteen sub-categories. To improve the migration process a maturity model called "ClM3" is introduced. Finally, proposed framework and maturity model is evaluated by forming different focus group meetings and taking advantages of the cloud experts' opinion. The results of this research can help managers have a safe and effective migration to cloud computing environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
