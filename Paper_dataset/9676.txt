AB Internet has had a lot of progress from the beginning of its career so far, and has been causing changes in human life. Cloud computing service is one of the recent changes in the way the Internet works. Due to its features, this new technology has progressed quickly because in cloud computing all kinds of facilities, are provided for the users as a service. Naturally, any change and any new concept in the world of technology, has problems and complexities of its own. The use of cloud computing is no exception. It has caused enormous challenges for the experts in this field. Load balancing, security and reliability of the data are some of these challenges. In this study a combination of Imperialist Competitive optimization Algorithm and genetics is used for scheduling jobs and resources in cloud computing. The proposed method uses a combinatorial algorithm, which makes it easy to schedule and plan, causes the jobs to be processed in the minimum possible time, and makes the resources of the network to be balanced. Given the importance of load balancing process in the cloud computing, the aim of this thesis is to assess the process and compare the discussed methods in this field.
