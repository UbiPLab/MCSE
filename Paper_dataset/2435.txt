AB Due to the increasing number of cloud applications, the amount of data in the cloud shows signs of growing faster than ever before. The nature of cloud computing requires cloud data processing systems that can handle huge volumes of data and have high performance. However, most cloud storage systems currently adopt a hash-like approach to retrieving data that only supports simple keyword-based enquiries, but lacks various forms of information search. Therefore, a scalable and efficient indexing scheme is clearly required. In this paper, we present a skip list-based cloud index, called SLC-index, which is a novel, scalable skip list-based indexing for cloud data processing. The SLC-index offers a two-layered architecture for extending indexing scope and facilitating better throughput. Dynamic load-balancing for the SLC-index is achieved by online migration of index nodes between servers. Furthermore, it is a flexible system due to its dynamic addition and removal of servers. The SLC-index is efficient for both point and range queries. Experimental results show the efficiency of the SLC-index and its usefulness as an alternative approach for cloud-suitable data structures.
