AB The advances in smart grids are enabling huge amount of data to be aggregated and analyzed for various smart grid applications. However, the traditional smart grid data management systems cannot scale and provide sufficient storage and processing capabilities. To address these challenges, this paper presents a smart grid big data eco-system based on the state-of-the-art Lambda architecture that is capable of performing parallel batch and real-time operations on distributed data. Furthermore, the presented eco-system utilizes a Hadoop Big Data Lake to store various types of smart grid data including smart meter, images, and video data. An implementation of the smart grid big data eco-system on a cloud computing platform is presented. To test the capability of the presented eco-system, real-time visualization and data mining applications were performed on the real smart grid data. The results of those applications on top of the eco-system suggest that it is capable of performing numerous smart grid big data analytics.
