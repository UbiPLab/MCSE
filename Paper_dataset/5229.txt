ID INTEGRAL SOLUTION PROBLEM
AB Linearly homomorphic signature schemes allow the performance of linear computations on authenticated data. They are important primitives for many applications, such as electronic voting, smart grids, electronic health records, and so on. Proxy signature schemes allow an original signer to delegate his/her signing power to a proxy signer, so that the proxy signer can sign on behalf of the original signer. Therefore, a signature scheme offering both of the above signatures properties is very desirable. In this paper, we construct the first linearly homomorphic proxy signature scheme, so the proxy signer can produce a linearly homomorphic signature on behalf of the original signer. The scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model. Moreover, the length of signature is short and constant. Linearly homomorphic proxy signature scheme can be used in applications, such as electronic business and cloud computing.
