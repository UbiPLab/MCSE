AB The Internet of Thing (IoT) is evolving into the Internet of Everything (IoE). Combining cloud computing with the IoE has attracted attention for wide area applications as a major service. In addition, low power wide area networks (LPWANs) have become a remarkable communication technology in IoT. Because the LPWAN provides long range communication with low power, it can be widely exploited for IoE applications. To improve quality of service, data traffic should be transmitted by considering its priority. However, this is not easy because the LPWAN has a low data rate and long transmission delay. Therefore, this paper proposes a dual-channel medium access control (MAC) to satisfy these requirements in the LPWAN. Generated data is classified into three categories by considering traffic characteristics and is delivered with different priority in dual channels. The performance evaluation is carried out with computer simulations. The results show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing schemes in the LPWAN.
