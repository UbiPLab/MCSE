AB This paper focuses on a big data on cloud computing environment by using open source software such as Open Stack and Eucalyptus because of the unification management of data and low cost. We propose a new approach to software dependability assessment based on stochastic differential equation modelling and jump diffusion process modelling in order to consider the interesting aspect of the numbers of components, cloud applications, and users. Moreover, we discuss the determination of an optimum software maintenance time minimizing the total expected software cost. In particular, we develop the three-dimensional AIR application for reliability and cost optimization analysis based on the proposed method. Then, we show numerical performance of the developed AIR application to evaluate the method of software reliability assessment for the big data on cloud computing.
