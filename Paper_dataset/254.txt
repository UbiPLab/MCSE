AB With the rapid development of computer technology, the research on complex networks has attracted more and more attention. At present, the research directions of cloud computing, big data, internet of vehicles, and distributed systems with very high attention are all based on complex networks. Community structure detection is a very important and meaningful research hotspot in complex networks. It is a difficult task to quickly and accurately divide the community structure and run it on large-scale networks. In this paper, we put forward a new community detection approach based on internode attraction, named IACD. This algorithm starts from the perspective of the important nodes of the complex network and refers to the gravitational relationship between two objects in physics to represent the forces between nodes in the network dataset, and then perform community detection. Through experiments on a large number of real-world datasets and synthetic networks, it is shown that the IACD algorithm can quickly and accurately divide the community structure, and it is superior to some classic algorithms and recently proposed algorithms.
