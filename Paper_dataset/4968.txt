DE Green Cloud; Migration of VM; Load Balancing; Data Centers
AB Cloud computing is acting at leading role in world's technical industry but at the same time it is contributing around 02% in pollution by emitting CO2. It's probably the most appropriate moment to touch this sensitive area of discussion as global warming and Paris act is a hot cake in the market. The idle terminal in data centers and heat dissipated by these devices makes significant contribution in making atmospheric changes. There is number of algoritluns available through which effective load balancing and power saving is possible. Migration of Virtual Machines (VM) so as to reduce requirement of physical machines is taken into under consideration so that overall power consumption will also be reduced. Energy consolidation is also an a Ica where light need to be thrown. It's time to implement a combinatorial approach where effective changes at server level and client level can make the significant difference. Developing green cloud is need of an era to avoid global carbon foot print.
