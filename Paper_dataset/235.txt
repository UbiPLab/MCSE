AB This study focuses on the use of cloud motion vectors (CMV) and fast radiative transfer models (FRTM) in the prospect of forecasting downwelling surface solar irradiation (DSSI). Using near-real-time cloud optical thickness (COT) data derived from multispectral images from the spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager (SEVIRI) onboard the Meteosat second generation (MSG) satellite, we introduce a novel short-term forecasting system (3 h ahead) that is capable of calculating solar energy in large-scale (1.5 million-pixel area covering Europe and North Africa) and in high spatial (5 km over nadir) and temporal resolution (15 min intervals). For the operational implementation of such a big data computing architecture (20 million simulations in less than a minute), we exploit a synergy of high-performance computing and deterministic image processing technologies (dense optical flow estimation). The impact of clouds forecasting uncertainty on DSSI was quantified in terms of cloud modification factor (CMF), for all-sky and clear sky conditions, for more generalized results. The forecast accuracy was evaluated against the real COT and CMF images under different cloud movement patterns, and the correlation was found to range from 0.9 to 0.5 for 15 min and 3 h ahead, respectively. The CMV forecast variability revealed an overall DSSI uncertainty in the range 18-34% under consecutive alternations of cloud presence, highlighting the ability of the proposed system to follow the cloud movement in opposition to the baseline persistent forecasting, which considers the effects of topocentric sun path on DSSI but keeps the clouds in "fixed" positions, and which presented an overall uncertainty of 30-43%. The proposed system aims to support the distributed solar plant energy production management, as well as electricity handling entities and smart grid operations.
