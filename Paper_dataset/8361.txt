ID VIRTUAL-REALITY
AB Deploying cache and computing resources in 5G mobile communication networks is considered an important way to reduce network transmission delay and redundant content transmission, improve content distribution efficiency and network computing processing capabilities. Through the construction of 5G user experience models for mobile augmented reality and tactile internet, the subjective expected experience of 5G users in mobile augmented reality applications is investigated. Based on the experimental results, the composition of mobile augmented reality, and the factors that affect 5G user, mobile 5G user experience model for augmented reality is as a design goal for mobile augmented reality. And research on mobile edge cloud computing powered by renewable energy. Based on the analysis of renewable energy, a 5G user computing task delay and power grid power consumption minimization model was established. It is decomposed into two sub-problems of computational resource allocation and task placement using alternating optimization. The sub-problems of computing tasks under renewable energy supply are obtained by solving the sub-problems. The experimental results show that the offload mode proposed in this paper is superior to the other two modes when the processing ratio before and after the task is less than 1, and the user contact frequency is greater than 0.0014. At the same time, it is obtained that the service node with higher mobility and larger computing power is allocated. The more workload, the more energy can be reduced in the network, thereby improving the performance of the system.
