AB A patient's complete medication history is a crucial element for physicians to develop a full understanding of the patient's medical conditions and treatment options. However, due to the fragmented nature of medical data, this process can be very time-consuming and often impossible for physicians to construct a complete medication history for complex patients. In this paper, we describe an accurate, computationally efficient and scalable algorithm to construct a medication history timeline. The algorithm is developed and validated based on 1 million random prescription records from a large national prescription data aggregator. Our evaluation shows that the algorithm can be scaled horizontally on-demand, making it suitable for future delivery in a cloud-computing environment. We also propose that this cloud-based medication history computation algorithm could be integrated into Electronic Medical Records, enabling informed clinical decision-making at the point of care.
