AB Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are becoming a significant enabling technology for a wide variety of applications. Advances in WSN have facilitated the realisation of pervasive health monitoring for both homecare and hospital environments. Sensor nodes are capable of sensing, processing, and communicating one or more vital signs, and they can be used in Wireless Body Sensor Networks (WBSNs) for health monitoring. Many studies were performed and are on-going in order to develop flexible, reliable, secure, realtime, and power-efficient WBSNs suitable for healthcare applications. This paper concentrates on the development of intelligent secure architecture for cloud based healthcare applications in wireless sensor networks. This paper describes the applications, issues and challenges of BSN in healthcare, energy efficient body sensor network architecture using aggregation, secure data collection, storage and data sharing using an authentication algorithm and a novel prediction model which act as an expert system for disease management.
