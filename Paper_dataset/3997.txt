AB Software-Defined Internet of Things (SDIoT) is defined as merging heterogeneous objects in a form of interaction among physical and virtual entities. Large scale of data centers, heterogeneity issues and their interconnections have made the resource management a hard problem specially when there are different actors in cloud system with different needs. Resource management is a vital requirement to achieve robust networks specially with facing continuously increasing amount of heterogeneous resources and devices to the network. The goal of this paper is reviews to address IoT resource management issues in cloud computing services. We discuss the bottlenecks of cloud networks for IoT services such as mobility. We review Fog computing in IoT services to solve some of these issues. It provides a comprehensive literature review of around one hundred studies on resource management in Peer to Peer Cloud Networks and IoT. It is very important to find a robust design to efficiently manage and provision requests and available resources. We also reviewed different search methodologies to help clients find proper resources to answer their needs.
