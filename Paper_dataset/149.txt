AB The quality of cloud computing services is evaluated based on various performance metrics out of which response time (RT) is most important. Nearly all cloud users demand its application's RT as minimum as possible, so to minimize overall system RT, the authors have proposed request response time prediction-based data center (DC) selection algorithm in this work. Proposed DC selection algorithm uses results of optimization function for DC selection formulated based on M/M/m queuing theory, as present cloud scenario roughly obeys M/M/m queuing model. In cloud environment, DC selection algorithms are assessed based on their performance in practice, rather than how they are supposed to be used. Hence, explained DC selection algorithm with various forecasting models is evaluated for minimum user application RT and RT prediction accuracy on various job arrival rates, real parallel workload types, and forecasting model training set length. Finally, performance of proposed DC selection algorithm with optimal forecasting model is compared with other DC selection algorithms on various cloud configurations.
