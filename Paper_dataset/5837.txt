AB The Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem is evolving towards the deployment of integrated environments, wherein heterogeneous devices pool their capacities together to match wide-ranging user and service requirements. As a consequence, solutions for efficient and synergistic cooperation among objects acquire great relevance. Along this line, this paper focuses on the adoption of the promising MIFaaS (Mobile-IoT-Federation-as-a-Service) paradigm to support delay-sensitive applications for high-end IoT devices in next-to-come fifth generation (5G) environments. MIFaaS fosters the provisioning of IoT services and applications with low-latency requirements by leveraging cooperation among private/public clouds of IoT objects at the edge of the network. A performance assessment of the MIFaaS paradigm in a cellular 5G environment based on both Long Term Evolution (LTE) and the recent Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) is presented. Obtained results demonstrate that the proposed solution outperforms classic approaches, highlighting significant benefits derived from the joint use of LTE and NB-IoT bandwidths in terms of increased number of successfully delivered IoT services.
