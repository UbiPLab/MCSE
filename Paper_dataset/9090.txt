AB We report six-dimensional (6D) potential energy surface (PES) and rovibrational scattering calculations for the CN-H-2 collision system. The PES was computed using the high-level ab initio spin-restricted coupled-cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations-F12B method and fitted to an analytic function using an invariant polynomial method in 6D. Quantum close-coupling calculations are reported for rotational transitions in CN by H-2 and D-2 collisions in 6D as well as four-dimensional (4D) within a rigid rotor model for collision energies of 1.0-1500 cm(-1). Comparisons with experimental data and previous 4D calculations are presented for CN rotational levels j(1) = 4 and 11. For the first time, rovibrational quenching cross sections and rate coefficients of CN (nu(1) = 1, j(1) = 0) in collisions with para-and ortho-H-2 are also reported in full-dimension. Agreement for pure rotational transitions is found to be good, but no experimental data on rovibrational collisional quenching for CN-H-2 are available. Applications of the current rotational and rovibrational rate coefficients in astrophysical modeling are briefly discussed. Published by AIP Publishing.
