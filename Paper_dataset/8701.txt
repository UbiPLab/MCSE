AB Cloud computing has recently gained popularity as a resource platform for on-demand, high availability and high scalability access to resources, while offering dynamic flexible infrastructures and QoS (Quality of Services) guaranteed services. In this environment, reliability is very important to ensure the effectiveness of the system and meet the desired SLA (System Level Agreement). Our work proposed in this paper uses the checkpointing of tasks to ensure the reliability and the replication of checkpointing files to ensure the accessibility. To ensure the reliability of services, we used a fault tolerance strategy based on adaptive checkpointing of two levels. This strategy takes into account the complexity and characteristics of cloud computing and it minimizes the overhead. To ensure the accessibility and the availability of checkpointing storage, we used a dynamic passive replication based on an availability degree specified by SLA criteria to decide the placement and the number of replicas.
