AB In previous publications we have introduced the concept of using a component-based software engineering paradigm to build Internet-enabled applications. We have proposed that this design allows for greater flexibility in deployment, better utilisation of resources and a reduction in total application development effort. We have described a system and realised that system as an API that can be used to design, build and execute such components. In this report we provide an overview of the key system components and present an implementation of an application developed using the system. We use this application to perform experimental and functional comparisons to show that the system provides advancements over the status quo.
