AB The rapid progress of cloud technology has attracted a growing number of video providers to consider deploying their streaming services onto cloud platform for more cost-effective, scalable and reliable performance. In this paper, we utilize Markov decision process model to formulate the dynamic deployment of cloud-based video services over multiple geographically distributed datacenters. We focus on maximizing the average profits for the video service provider over a long run and introduce an average performance criteria which reflects the cost and user experience jointly. We develop an optimal algorithm based on the sensitivity analysis and sample-based policy iteration to obtain the optimal video placement and request dispatching strategy. We demonstrate the optimality of our algorithm with theoretical proof and specify the practical feasibility of our algorithm. We conduct simulations to evaluate the performance of our algorithm and the results show that our strategy can effectively cut down the total cost and guarantee users' quality of experience (QoE).
