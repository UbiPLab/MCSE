AB Given the rapid development of the Internet and the Internet of Things, the network has been integrated into all aspects of human life. It has also become an indispensable part of human life and the development of the industry. Cloud computing and other network analysis technologies have been used to collect and analyze real-time data, which are generated by a large network of user groups to identify traffic and behavior bias of the network users. This study improved the collaborative filtering algorithm and association rules to be more suitable for analysis of network data using Hadoop-based cloud computing technology.
