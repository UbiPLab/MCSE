AB Mobile cloud computing is an emerging commercial infrastructure paradigm to enhance the power of smart mobile devices. However, there are significant problems pertaining to efficient provisioning and delivery of mobile applications using cloud IT resources. These barriers concern various levels such as enabling individual mobile user's to dynamically adjust their computing demands and managing these infrequent demands under intermittent network connectivity along with maintaining quality of service (QoS), whereas cloud resources are available for long-time quanta granularity and incur significant setup times. This paper proposes a demand-based computation offloading framework (DBCOF) to balance these competing goals. It provides a mechanism to solve the key problem of application partitioning according to user's demand. In addition, it also reduces the monetary costs per request for the service providers and minimizes service-level agreement (SLA) violations for maintaining QoS. Previous approaches to these problems have focused only on maximizing energy savings in all contexts, irrespective of user's computing requirements. We have implemented the DBCOF prototype for Android and explored its design space by extending CloudSim, the state-of-the-art cloud simulator. Analyses of the results show the effectiveness of DBCOF system in terms of managing computation offloading demands. It also reduces the cost of providing cloud resources to mobile devices to 44.79% and minimizes SLA violations to nearly 1.34% for maintaining the QoS.
