ID COMBINATORIAL ANALYSIS
AB With the rapid development of cloud computing, many large-scale data centers are being built to provide increasingly popular online application services, such as search, e-mails, WeChat, and microblog, etc. The reliability of a massive data center network is the likelihood that it performs its expected functions consistently well under the given conditions within a specified time interval. A typical approach to measure the reliability of the system is to count the mean time to failure (MTTF), which shows the time that the appearance of a certain number of faulty subsystem costs. The higher the MTTF, the more reliable the system is. In this paper, we explore the reliability of data center network DCell when it is decomposed into smaller ones along the last dimension under server (node) failure model and link failure model, respectively.
