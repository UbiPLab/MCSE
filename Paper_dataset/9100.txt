AB Recent years have witnessed significant progress of workflow systems in different business areas. However, in the medical domain, the workflow systems are comparatively scarcely researched. In the medical domain, the workflows are as important as in other areas. In fact, the flow of information in the healthcare industry is even more critical than it is in other industries. Workflow can provide a new way of looking at how processes and procedures are completed in particular medical systems, and it can help improve the decision-making in these systems. Despite potential capabilities of workflow systems, medical systems still often perceive critical challenges in maintaining patient medical information that results in the difficulties in accessing patient data by different systems. In this paper, a new cloud-based service-oriented architecture is proposed. This architecture will support a medical workflow system integrated with cloud services aligned with medical standards to improve the healthcare system.
