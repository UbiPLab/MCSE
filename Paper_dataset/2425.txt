AB In order to improve the accuracy of wind power prediction (WPP), we propose a WPP based on multivariate phase space reconstruction (MPSR) and multivariate linear regression (MLR). Firstly, the multivariate time series (TS) are constructed through reasonable selection of wind power and weather factors, which are closely associated with wind power. Secondly, the phase space of the multivariate time series is reconstructed based on the chaos theory and C-C method. Thirdly, an auto regression model for multivariate phase space is created by regarding phase variables as state variables, and the very-short-term wind power is predicted by using a multi-linear regression algorithm. Finally, a parallel algorithm based on map/reduce is presented to improve computing speed. A cloud computing platform, Hadoop consisting of five nodes, is established as a matter of convenience, followed by the prediction of wind power of a wind farm in the Hunan province of China. The experimental results show that the model based on MPSR and MLR is more accurate than both the continuous method and the simple approximation method, and the parallel algorithm based on map/reduce effectively accelerates the computing speed.
