AB In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has found wide application and attracted much attention. Since most of the end-terminals in IoT have limited capabilities for storage and computing, it has become a trend to outsource the data from local to cloud computing. To further reduce the communication bandwidth and storage space, data deduplication has been widely adopted to eliminate the redundant data. However, since data collected in IoT are sensitive and closely related to users' personal information, the privacy protection of users' information becomes a challenge. As the channels, like the wireless channels between the terminals and the cloud servers in IoT, are public and the cloud servers are not fully trusted, data have to be encrypted before being uploaded to the cloud. However, encryption makes the performance of deduplication by the cloud server difficult because the ciphertext will be different even if the underlying plaintext is identical. In this paper, we build a centralized privacy-preserving duplicate removal storage system, which supports both file-level and block-level deduplication. In order to avoid the leakage of statistical information of data, Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) technology is utilized to protect the deduplication process on the cloud server. The results of the experimental analysis demonstrate that the new scheme can significantly improve the deduplication efficiency and enhance the security. It is envisioned that the duplicated removal system with privacy preservation will be of great use in the centralized storage environment of IoT.
