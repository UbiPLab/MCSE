AB In recent, cloud computing paradigm and open source as a huge trend in the Information Communication Technology (ICT) are widely applied, being closely interrelated to each other in the various applications. The integrated services by both technologies is generally regarded as one of a prospective web-based business models impacting the concerned industries. In spite of progressing those technologies, there are a few application cases in the geo-based application domains. The purpose of this study is to develop a cloud-based service system for satellite image processing based on the pure and full open source. On the OpenStack, cloud computing open source, virtual servers for system management by open source stack and image processing functionalities provided by OTB have been built or constructed. In this stage, practical image processing functions for KOMPSAT within this service system are thresholding segmentation, pan-sharpening with multi-resolution image sets, change detection with paired image sets. This is the first case in which a government-supporting space science institution provides cloud-based services for satellite image processing functionalities based on pure open source stack. It is expected that this implemented system can expand with further image processing algorithms using public and open data sets.
