AB Network virtualization is one of the most promising technologies for future networking and considered as a critical information technology resource that connects distributed, virtualized cloud computing services and different components such as storage, servers, and application. Network virtualization allows multiple virtual networks to coexist on the same shared physical infrastructure simultaneously. One of crucial factors in network virtualization is virtual network embedding which provisions a method to allocate physical substrate resources to virtual network requests. In this article, we investigate virtual network embedding strategies and related issues for resource allocation of an Internet provider to efficiently embed virtual networks that are requested by virtual network operators who share the same infrastructure provided by the Internet provider. In order to achieve that goal, we design a heuristic virtual network embedding algorithm that simultaneously embeds virtual nodes and virtual links of each virtual network request onto the physic infrastructure. Via extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed scheme significantly improves the performance of virtual network embedding by enhancing the long-term average revenue as well as acceptance ratio and resource utilization of virtual network requests compared to prior algorithms.
