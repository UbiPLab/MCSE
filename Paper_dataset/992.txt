AB Cloud computing has various benefits in terms of cost saving, flexibility, efficiency etc. but it is not much efficient to perform real time computing in cloud infrastructure. The real time system acquires benefits of scalable virtualized environment and intensive cloud computing capabilities for executing real time tasks. Most of the real time applications undergo its processing on remote cloud computing nodes and chances of error occurrence is also high due to undecided latency. And it is essential that the safety critical applications should have higher reliability. To determine whether the fault tolerance mechanism is having the higher reliability and availability or not, an efficient adaptive fault tolerance mechanism has been proposed through reliability assessment architecture to enhance the reliability of the system. Also fine grained check point algorithm is used to minimize the latency.
