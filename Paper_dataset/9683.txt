AB The present study aims at recognizing the problem of dynamic virtual machine (VM) Consolidation using virtualization, live migration of VMs from underloaded and overloaded hosts and switching idle nodes to the sleep mode as a very effective approach for utilizing resources and accessing energy efficient cloud computing data centres. The challenge in the present study is to reduce energy consumption thus guarantee Service Level Agreement (SLA) at its highest level. The proposed algorithm predicts CPU utilization in near future using Time-Series method as well as Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES) technique, and takes appropriate action based on the current and predicted CPU utilization and comparison of their values with the dynamic upper and lower thresholds. The four phases in this algorithm include identification of overloaded hosts, identification of underloaded hosts, selection of VMs for migration and identification of appropriate hosts as the migration destination. The study proposes solutions along with dynamic upper and lower thresholds in regard with the first two phases. By comparing current and predicted CPU utilizations with these thresholds, overloaded and underloaded hosts are accurately identified to let migration happen only from the hosts which are currently as well as in near future overloaded and underloaded. The authors have used Maximum Correlation (MC) VM selection policy in the third phase, and attempted in phase four such that hosts with moderate loads, i.e. not overloaded hosts, liable to overloading and underloaded, are selected as the migration destination. The simulation results from the Clouds framework demonstrate an average reduction of 83.25, 25.23 percent and 61.1 in the number of VM migrations, energy consumption and SLA violations (SLAV), respectively.
