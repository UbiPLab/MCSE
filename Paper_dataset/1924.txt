AB Cloud computing and cloud applications are emerging as the latest technology. Cloud applications are developing very fast and adopted by most of the firms around the globe. The cloud applications are widely accepted and considered as a notion of the digitized era, but the cloud product lifecycle management (PLM) is not adopted much in Indian firms. Cloud PLM is an upcoming cloud application, but its adoption entails various challenges. Considering this fact, the paper aims to empirically investigate the critical challenges encountered by many firms for migration to of cloud PLM. A multicriteria decision making method, grey Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory along with interpretive structural modeling are employed to identify the causal challenges and their hierarchy to cloud PLM adoption. This empirical study brings out "data security" and "trust on solution provider" as the most important and critical challenges for migration to cloud PLM adoption. The findings may act as a guide for the managers in manufacturing firms in identifying the critical challenges to utilize the benefits of cloud PLM over on-premise PLM systems.
