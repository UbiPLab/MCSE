DE cloud computing; architectures; databases; migration
AB Cloud Computing is seen as technology in late 2007 and today represents a subject in constant debate, due to its the multiple advantages. Thus, due to the transition to new technologies, Cloud becomes one of the main pillars of the IT industry. To provide high performance, scalability solving the problem today is necessary because huge quantities of data. This article presents solutions to architectures and methodologies for cloud application migration. The structure of the article is conceived in four chapters, to which a chapter of conclusions has been added. The first chapter presents some aspects of using data managed by cloud computing. Below are some architectures for systems and databases in cloud computing. The last chapter was dedicated to cloud migration solutions.
