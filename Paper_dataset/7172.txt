AB Utilizing the entire resources in the cloud is not possible, because of complex application. To manage the execution of such a difficult types of application, the parallel processing mechanism that tries to solve this problem while running the complex application. The volume of each node is divided into n number of Virtual Machines (VM) by using the virtualization technology. In this paper we propose a scheduling mechanism that partitions the computing capacity of each node in the data centers using the K-Level mechanism with Buddy Memory Allocation. The K-Level Task Allocation algorithm is used to schedule the parallel jobs in each node of K-level VMs which makes the resource utilization in an efficient manner.
