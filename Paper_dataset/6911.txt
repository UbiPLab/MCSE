AB The analysis of profiles of temperature (7) with regard to the effective radius (re) of cloud particles shows the vertical distribution of the effective particle size in clouds. The profiles are computed and constructed from satellite retrieved data and show graphically the distribution of the cloud particle size focused on convective clouds and convective storms subsequently. This special technique of severe storm analysis and forecasting, developed by Rosenfeld et al. (1998), has been tested in several countries around the world. Forecasting and predicting dangerous phenomena such as hailstorms or tornadoes that occur in severe storms is the main objective of this technique. This nowcasting tool is now also being tested in Central Europe for the first time. The basic description of the theory is presented in this paper including the results of our research, which confirms application of the theory in Central Europe in severe storm nowcasting. One typical severe and one nonsevere storm event in the Czech Republic and their vicinity are selected and described to show the main difference of T-re profiles in distinguishing of severe weather forecast. Furthermore, this paper discusses the possible benefits of this method for the Czech Weather Service, because it clearly reveals severe storm development in the monitored area.
