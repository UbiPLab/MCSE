AB Dynamic data possession verification is a common requirement in cloud storage systems. After the client outsources its data to the cloud, it needs to not only check the integrity of its data but also verify whether the update is executed correctly. Previous researches have proposed various schemes based on Merkle Hash Tree (MHT) and implemented some initial improvements to prevent the tree imbalance. This paper tries to take one step further: Is there still any problems remained for optimization? In this paper, we study how to raise the efficiency of data dynamics by improving the parts of query and rebalancing, using a new data structure called Rank-Based Merkle AVL Tree (RB-MAT). Furthermore, we fill the gap of verifying multiple update operations at the same time, which is the novel batch updating scheme. The experimental results show that our efficient scheme has better efficiency than those of existing methods.
