AB Security is a crucial factor for the appropriate functioning of fog/edge computing. Secured mutual authentication in networks has become key demand as per the current security standard. Several applications are in its requirements like wireless sensor network (WSN), Distributed Systems, Micro-Cloud, Smart City, Smart Industry 4.0. Problem statement is "Design and implementation of Fog servers and edge devices to dynamically interconnect with each other using secured mutual authentication", which is an NP complete problem. Implementation of secured mutual authentication protocol (SMAP) using techniques of pseudo-random number generator, time-stamps and hash functions can only be considered to evaluate the best performance for connecting large number of smart devices. Our protocol avoids storing master secret keys and repetition of session keys, which makes it more secure and carries no overhead. The experimental results show that the secured mutual authentication system is efficient in comparison to recent benchmarks.
