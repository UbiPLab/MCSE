AB More and more companies in technical wholesale rely on IT services from the cloud. This development must also be reflected in the basic selection procedures for IT products and services. In this article, this is shown by means of decision-making processes and criteria for evaluating offers for operational application systems as well as for IT platforms and providers. Cloud computing is becoming increasingly important as evidenced by the growing market for IT infrastructure, development platform and software services. For companies, this opens up new opportunities to meet their IT needs. The central evaluation criterion here is the economic benefit that results from the use of cloud offerings in comparison to the acquisition and operation of company-owned IT. This development must also be reflected in the basic selection procedures for IT products and services. For a comprehensive view, both quantitative and qualitative factors are to be included, suggesting an extended cost-benefit analysis for enterprise cloud computing. In this paper, this will be illustrated by decision processes and criteria for the evaluation of offers for operational application systems as well as for IT platforms and providers.
