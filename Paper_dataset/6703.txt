AB Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) aim to streamline the operation of vehicles and manage vehicle traffic, while other information ITS can strengthen Cloud computing by storing and processing the collected information. Resource management is a particularly challenging issue for vehicular cloud development. In this paper, we propose a protocol to assist in the search and management of resources in a vehicular cloud without depending on the support of roadside infrastructure. Thus, vehicles are expected to organize themselves and establish collaborations to manage and share their resources. Simulation results show that, in comparison to other works, the proposed protocol achieved an increase in the average cluster head duration of around 18%, an increase of 13% of member vehicles, a decrease of 3% of cluster head changes, and a reduced amount of clusters by around 11%. The proposed protocol also achieved a higher availability of resources, by about 96%, and a lower time for search and allocation (around 0.5 (ms) to search 1 hop, and 1(ms) to search 3 or 2 hops).
