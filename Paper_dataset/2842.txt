AB Cloud Computing is a gathering of physical and virtualized assets gave to the clients according to request and pay per uses bases via internet. Basically, the task scheduling and resource allocation two features are considered such as cost and makespan. In order to achieve better performance in task scheduling, resource allocation and task scheduling must be precisely organized and optimized jointly. Several works have been published in the literature to do the scheduling in cloud. In this paper, for enhancing the scheduling process cuckoo search (CS) and harmony search (HS) algorithm is hybrid as CHSA to improve the optimization problem. These two algorithms are effectively combined to do intelligent process scheduling. According to this, a new multi-objective function is proposed by combining cost, energy consumption, memory usage, credit and penalty. Finally, the performance of the CHSA algorithm is compared with different algorithms such as existing hybrid cuckoo gravitational search algorithm, individual CS and HS algorithm with various multi-objective parameters. By analyzing the result our proposed CHSA algorithm attain minimum cost, minimum memory usage, minimum energy consumption, minimum penalty and maximum credit compared to existing techniques.
