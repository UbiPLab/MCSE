AB Cloud Computing has revolutionized the software, platform and infrastructure provisioning. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers offer on-demand and configurable Virtual Machine (VMs) to tenants of cloud computing services. A key consolidation force that widespread IaaS deployment is the use of pay-as-you-go and pay-as-you-use cost models. In these models, a service price can be composed of two dimensions: the individual consumption, and a proportional value charged for service maintenance. A common practice for public providers is to dilute both capital and operational costs on predefined pricing sheets. In this context, we propose PSVE (Proportional-Shared Virtual Energy), a cost model for IaaS providers based on CPU energy consumption. Aligned with traditional commodity prices, PSVE is composed of two key elements: an individualized cost accounted from CPU usage of VMs (e.g., processing and networking), and a shared cost from common hypervisor management operations, proportionally distributed among VMs.
