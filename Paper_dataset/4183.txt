AB Purpose To analyze the performance of multistate cloud computing transition system through the various reliability measures is the purpose of this paper. Design/methodology/approach In this article, a mathematical model for a multistate cloud computing transition system with various types of failures has been analyzed by using the Markov process, supplementary variable technique and Laplace transformation. Findings Various reliability measures such that reliability, availability, mean time to failure (MTTF), mean time to repair and cost analysis have also been analyzed. This article presents some geographic illustrations for the practical utility of the model. Originality/value The authors developed a mathematical model to analyze the reliability of the cloud computing transition system by considering the possible failures.
