AB The multi-homed mobile devices in the mobile cloud computing (MCC) systems can improve their throughput by allocating the application data over several paths simultaneously, enabled by the promising Multipath TCP (MPTCP) technology. Meanwhile, network attacks against current Internet infrastructures are likely to increase, especially with the widely deployment of MCC systems. When a MPTCP connection is under network attacks and becomes a poor-performing path or a broken path, it can significantly affect other stable paths and in the absence of related schemes to handle this, MPTCP will undoubtedly suffer from serious performance degradation. Moreover, applying MPTCP to cloud data delivery may generally lead to higher energy consumption and is not favorable to a power-constrained mobile device. In this paper, we propose MPTCP-La/E-2, a low-rate distributed denial-of-service (LDDoS) attack-aware energy-efficient MPTCP solution aiming at: 1) avoiding the LDDoS-caused performance degradation of cloud multipath transmission, which has been seldom considered in existing MPTCP solutions and 2) optimizing the energy usage while still maintaining user's perceived quality of cloud multipathing services. The simulation results show that MPTCP-La/E-2 outperforms the baseline MPTCP in terms of QoS and energy-savings in a multi homed MCC network environment.
