AB Information security incident handling strategies or models are important to ensure the security of organisations, particularly in cloud and big data environments. However, existing strategies or models may not adequate as cloud data are generally virtualised, geographically distributed and ephemeral, presenting both technical and jurisdictional challenges. We present an integrated cloud incident handling and forensic-by-design model. We then seek to validate the model using a set of controlled experiments on a cloud-related incident. Three popular cloud storage applications were deployed namely, Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive. This study demonstrates the utility of the model for organisational cloud users to undertake incident investigations (e.g. collect and analyse residual data from cloud storage applications).
