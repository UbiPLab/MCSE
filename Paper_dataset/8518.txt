AB Due to exponential increase in the capacity demands raised by the smart devices and multimedia applications of new generations, existing cellular networks are facing significant burden. To provide a solution to the challenges faced by 4th generation (4G) networks, there is utmost need of improving existing technologies as well as developing new technologies to meet the key requirements of 5th generation (5G) networks as well as the Next Generation Mobile Networks (NGMNs). Networks having high capacity, low latency, faster data rates and better quality of service is the vision of 5G mobile networks. In order to achieve this, we will need wider bandwidths as offered by millimeter wave bands, more spatial diversity as offered by Massive multiple input multiple output technology, denser networks as designed in dense small cell deployment technology, new waveforms using efficient coding techniques such as filtered orthogonal frequency division multiplexing and filter bank multiple carrier, a new architecture supporting virtualization and advance computing techniques as in network function virtualization, software defined networks, cloud radio access networks. Many more technologies are yet to be introduced. This tutorial gives an insight to the candidate technologies proposed by researchers till date and the progress made, for defining the standards to meet the requirements of 5G and NGMNs. It explains the basic concept of the technology and the latest development in the industry to support this technology.
