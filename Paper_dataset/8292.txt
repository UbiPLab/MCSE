AB In order to create more attractive graffiti works, the Internet of Things technology is used to collect people's preference information data, and then cloud computing and big data analysis are applied to calculate and analyze the data, so as to get more design elements in line with people's preferences, providing more material for the creators of graffiti art and facilitating their further creation of graffiti. In recent years, graffiti art, as a kind of postmodern marginal cultural art, has great expressiveness and creativity, which makes graffiti art widely used. Particularly in visual communication design, graffiti art has more characteristics and is deeply loved by the people. With the continuous development of science and technology, Internet of Things technology and cloud computing have acquired more information for many fields, thus assisting the field to complete deeper analysis and research. However, there are few applications in the field of graffiti art. Therefore, this paper combines cloud computing and Internet of Things to obtain more visual communication design elements to provide material for the creator, which is conductive for their continuing creation.
