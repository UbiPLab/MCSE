AB The difficulty of stock forecasting lies in the need of system with big data function and high effect computing function system foundation, with historical data as the basis for the future trend simulation. With the analysis of the stock data based on cloud computing, this paper studies the system requirements of stock data analysis, analyzes the functional requirements of the system, constructs the business process, and studies the dynamic modeling and static modeling of the system modeling. On this basis, this paper constructs the stock data analysis cloud computing system model, from top to bottom as the presentation layer, the application layer, the middle layer, the cluster layer, and develops the stock data analysis system architecture program, which mainly includes the representation layer, business layer, data layer. And finally this paper builds the entire system, and to achieve stock data analysis.
