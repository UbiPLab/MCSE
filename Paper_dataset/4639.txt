AB Cloud computing services is often related to the process of handling enormous amount of data, often Cloud storage leads to many security problems such as data integrity checking, confidentiality and privacy issues, organizations as to assure that cloud service provider as current privacy and security policies for sharing of data with various organization. In this paper, we proposed architecture for cloud security and privacy issues enabling the services for faster access of data providing confidentiality, integrity, authentication and authorization. The experiment is performed using the proposed framework in cloud environment and is computed in software as a service layer. Optimal web service is retrieved using multi objective particle swarm optimization based on QoS factor, the performance is analyzed and the proposed techniques out performed well.
