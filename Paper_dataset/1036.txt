AB This paper is documenting the potential of Fog Computing in Education. First, this study explores the difference between cloud computing and Fog Computing. Then the features of computing explained briefly. A tremendous increase in Internet usage among the people does not allow the sustainability to continue depending on Cloud Computing as a centralized web server, due to the truth that Cloud Computing system allows access to internet data as well as therefore making it feasible for users to availability, share along with store information in remote servers. With Fog Computing, multiple users, gadgets such as automobiles, wearable gizmos, sensing units, wise gadgets, an organization can accept one another utilizing their very own Fog facilities. In the educational sector, Fog computing technology boosts educational operations and provides a platform with agility, versus slowing them down or quitting them. Fog computing is a modern technology that is set for high development in the future, as well as will substantially improve day-to-day procedures for many sectors, including education. Finally, security issues and challenges of implementation Fog computing discussed.
