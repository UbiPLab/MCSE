AB In this paper, we propose an enhanced security framework for securing the cloud users data in the cloud environment. This new security framework consists of access control methodology, encryption/decryption technique and digital signature algorithms. Here, a new Elliptic Curve Cryptography based key generation algorithm is proposed for generating highly secured keys. Moreover, a new Identity based Elliptic curve Access Control mechanism (Id-EAC) is also proposed in this paper for restricting the cloud user's data accessibility over the different kind of data. In addition, a new binary value based two phase encryption and decryption algorithm that referred the elliptic curve cryptographic based key values is introduced to secure the cloud user's data in the cloud environment. Finally, a new modulo function based Lightweight Digital Signature Algorithm is also proposed to ensure the data integrity in this proposed security framework. This security framework is provided the high data security, accessibility and integrity for the user data. The experimental results show that the efficiency of the proposed algorithms in this security framework is proved as better than other existing algorithms in terms of security and performance.
