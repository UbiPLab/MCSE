DE Marine minehunting equipment; safety performance
ID SEDIMENTS
AB For sea minehunting with a complex structure, index selection by the conventional evaluation method is not reasonable; it has strong subjectivity, resulting in distortion of evaluation results. Therefore, the combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis is used to carry out the safety performance evaluation of sea minehunting equipment. By using the method of qualitative analysis, the evaluation index system of the safety performance of minehunting equipment can be established; expert experience and knowledge are transformed into the comparison of important degrees of each index to get the quantitative characterization of the important degrees. The fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is used to obtain the comprehensive evaluation result of the safety performance of minehunting equipment. The results show that the method can accurately reflect the state of minehunting equipment performance.
