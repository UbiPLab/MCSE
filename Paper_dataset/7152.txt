AB This paper proposes to enhance capacity-centric fiber-wireless (FiWi) broadband access networks based on data-centric Ethernet technologies with computation-and storage-centric cloudlets to provide reliable cloud services at the edge of FiWi networks and thereby realize the vision of mobile-edge computing (MEC). To reduce offload delay and prolong battery life of edge devices, a novel cloudlet-aware resource management scheme is proposed that incorporates offloading activities into the underlying FiWi dynamic bandwidth allocation process. The whole system is designed in two time division multiple access layers to enhance the network performance. To allow for the efficient coexistence of FiWi and MEC traffic, the offloaded traffic is scheduled outside the FiWi transmission slots. To thoroughly study the scheme's performance, a comprehensive analytical framework is developed that covers a rich set of performance metrics, including packet delay of both FiWi and MEC traffic, response time efficiency, offload gain-overhead ratio, energy efficiency, and battery life. Analytical results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the cloudlet-enhanced FiWi networks for MEC by employing the proposed solution. Further, we develop an experimental testbed to validate the accuracy of our analytical model via real-world measurements.
