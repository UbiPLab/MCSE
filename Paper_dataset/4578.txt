AB In recent years, ubiquitous-based telemedicine has become increasingly popular in many countries; this is a new discipline that can break distance barriers in order to improve access to various medical services. Due to recent progress in telecare services, scientists provided those pregnant women with advanced medical care via medical cyber-physical systems (MCPS) to achieve eugenics. The MCPS presents a new level of integrated intelligence that is characterized by interaction and coordination of computing processes with physical processes. In an environment of MCPS, security is one of the key objectives for ubiquitous telemonitoring. In this paper, we take advantage of the cloud characteristics and the high efficiency of MCPS to achieve the desired medical monitoring and also to effectively protect pregnancy-related privacy. We establish a cloud computing platform for all users to access the cloud information at any time in accordance with their own demands. We also used cryptography to design the medical system. Identity-based combined encryption and signature cryptosystem were proposed as the best ways to ensure the security and privacy of healthcare data in the cloud.
