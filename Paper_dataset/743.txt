AB With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G, edge computing, as a new computing paradigm, has been widely popularized in academia and industry. Due to the distributed architecture and being close to the user, edge computing can faster respond to the IoT device's request and provide a better quality of service for IoT applications. An important application of edge computing is to outsource the complicated computation task to the nearby edge nodes. Modular exponentiation is widely considered as one of the most common and expensive operations in cryptographic protocols. As far as we know, all secure outsourcing algorithms of modular exponentiation are based on the centralized cloud server, but not based on multiple edge nodes. In this article, we propose the first secure and distributed outsourcing algorithm for modular exponentiation (fixed base and variable exponent) under the multiple noncolluding edge node model. In our algorithm, the exponent is divided into a certain number of parts. In addition, we propose another secure and distributed outsourcing algorithm of modular exponentiation (variable base and variable exponent). The user can protect the privacy in the process of outsourcing and detect the invalid results from edge nodes with high probability. Finally, we provide the experimental evaluation to support that our proposed algorithms are efficient on both the user side and the edge node side.
