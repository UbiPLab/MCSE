AB Contemporary booming growth of the Internet-based techniques has risen a revolution of network oriented applications. A connected environment further drives the amalgamation of various techniques, such as edge computing, cloud computing and Internet-of-Things (IoT). Privacy concerns have appeared throughout the process of data transmissions, some of which are caused by the low security communication protocols. In practice, high security protection protocols generally require a higher-level computing resource due to more computation workloads and communication manipulations. The implementation of high security communications is restricted when data size becomes large. This work focuses on the issue of the conflict between privacy protection and efficiency and proposes a new approach for providing higher level security transmission using multi-channel communications. We implement experiment evaluations to examine the performance of the proposed approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
