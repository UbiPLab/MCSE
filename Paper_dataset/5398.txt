ID CONSENSUS PROBLEM
AB Nowadays, network bandwidth and hardware technology are developing rapidly and resulting in the vigorous development of the Internet. However, cloud computing, an Internet -based development in which dynamically scalable and often virtualized resources are provided as a service over the Internet has become a significant issue. In a cloud computing environment, the fault-tolerance is an important research topic. To cope with the influence from faulty components, reaching a common consistency at the presence of faults before performing some special tasks is essential. However, the previous protocols for the interactive consistency problem of cloud computing are not enough for a cloud computing environment with hybrid dual fallible components that nodes and communication media maybe in dormant or malicious fault simultaneously. In this study, the interactive consistency problem with a hybrid dual fallible cloud computing topology is revisited. The new proposed protocol can make all fault-free nodes reach consistency with minimal rounds of message exchanges and tolerate the maximal number of allowable dormant and malicious faulty nodes and communication media in a cloud computing environment.
