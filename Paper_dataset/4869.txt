ID INTERNET; THINGS
AB The Internet of Things concept has found applications in a wide range of solutions, including smart homes, smart cities, enterprise systems, and others. Due to the limited resources available on physical devices and the intermittent availability of wireless networks, IoT may hugely benefit from Mobile Cloud Computing as it may provide the necessary processing power and the storage. This, however, increases the complexity of IoT systems and calls for a flexible testing environment to simplify the development process. In this paper we propose the concept of a software-defined IoT testbed which enables an IoT system to be immersed and tested in a virtual environment in order to evaluate its behavior under controllable conditions. Additionally, the features of the implemented testbed prototype are discussed on the basis of a specific use case.
