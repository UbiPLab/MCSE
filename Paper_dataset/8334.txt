AB Five-axis side milling technique for Niemann worm wheel teeth flank using a tapered flat-end mill is presented. Equations describing the worm wheel tooth flank were derived based on differential geometry and the working principle of gears. The tooth flank was modified by offsetting its point cloud computed using these equations along the normal direction. The maximum normal curvature of the worm wheel tooth flank was computed, and its minimum radius of curvature was obtained. The cutter path step length and spacing between cutter travels were computed to generate a uniform path for five-axis machining. Software simulations of the cutter path were performed for validation and for analysing errors in the worm wheel tooth flank machining; this technique was also verified by milling worm wheels. The results demonstrated that the technique not only improved machining efficiency by 5 times compared with point milling but also guaranteed precision machining of the tooth flank for five-axis machining of cylindrical worm drives.
