AB Sensor/Actuator devices are currently being massively adopted, often as nodes of larger sensor networks. These sensor networks are typically dedicated to context acquisition (e.g., get temperature) as well as providing acting services (e.g., open the blinds). However, regarding their own data storage, data is usually sent to Fog/Cloud servers. Fog/Cloud storage solutions provide several advantages over sensor network storage solutions, but also some drawbacks. For instance, in Cloud environments, privacy and legal issues may appear, while in Fog, additional costly hardware must be purchased and maintained, at least a server with redundant storage or many servers when distributed data storage is required. Nowadays, sensor nodes count in thousands around us, and they have significantly increased their storage and computational capabilities over the past few years. Therefore, traditional Fog/Cloud storage solutions could be combined or even replaced by Mist/Edge storage solutions for many use cases. A principal contribution of this paper is a novel data distribution and replication storage solution for wireless sensor networks, the first to consider sensor node heterogeneity to find the optimal storage replication according to node capabilities. The solution has been carefully planned and implemented to run even in very low-end microcontrollers, that lives in many of our surrounding smart devices. Other contributions include data comparing Mist/Edge and Amazon S3 regular storage, showing that there remains plenty of room for research into Mist/Edge storage, as well as into the industry itself.
