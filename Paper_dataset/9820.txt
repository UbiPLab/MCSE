AB With the wide adoption of cloud computing paradigm, it is important to develop appropriate techniques to protect client data privacy in the cloud. Encryption is one of the major techniques that could be used to achieve this gaol. However, data encryption at the rest along is insufficient for secure cloud computation environments. Further efficient techniques for carrying out computation over encrypted data are also required. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and garbled circuits are naturally used to process encrypted data without leaking any information about the data. However, existing FHE schemes are inefficient for processing large amount of data in cloud and garbled circuits are one time programs and cannot be reused. Using modern technologies such as FHE, several authors have developed reusable garbled circuit techniques in recent years. But they are not efficient either and could not be deployed at a large scale. By relaxing the privacy definition from perfect forward secrecy to all-or-nothing privacy, we are able to design efficient reusable garbled circuits in this paper. These reusable garbled computation techniques could be used for processing encrypted cloud data efficiently. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.
