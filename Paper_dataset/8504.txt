AB A cloud data center consumes more energy for computation and switching servers between modes. Virtual Machine (VM) migration enhances the execution of cloud server farm in terms of energy proficiency, adaptation to internal failure, and accessibility. Cloud suppliers, be that as it may, ought to likewise enhance for amounts like energy consumption and administrations costs and in this manner, trying to have all the Virtual Machines with the least measures of physical equipment machines conceivable. The part of virtualization is critical and its execution is subjected to VM migration and machine allotment. A greater amount of the energy is caught up in the cloud; consequently, the use of various calculations is required for sparing energy and productivity upgradation in the proposed work. In the proposed work, the Naive Bayes classifier with hybrid optimization using Artificial Bee Colony-Bat Algorithm (ABC-BA) was implemented to reduce the energy consumption in VM migration. The proposed method was evaluated in CloudSim and the performances were compared using performance index such as success &failure rate, and energy consumption. It is observed from the implementation results that the proposed method reduces energy consumption compared to other existing methods. From the implementation outcomes of the proposed work, it was understood that the model was able to achieve the minimum energy consumption and failure rate i.e., 1000-1200 kWh, 0.2 with maximum success rate and accuracy of 1 and 97.77%.
