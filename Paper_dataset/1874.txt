AB Accurate spatio-temporal information about rice growth is an important factor for agronomic management and regional grain yield estimation. In this letter, a unified framework for monitoring and mapping of rice using dense time-series of Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is proposed. A processing chain for such dense time-series Sentinel-1 images is developed with the Google Earth Engine's cloud computing platform. A dense time-series analysis of backscatter response of rice with different management practices is analyzed. Subsequently, the early and late transplanted rice is classified using a clustering algorithm within this platform. The proposed approach is used to monitor different cultivars of rice in three districts in the state of West Bengal, which is one of the major rice growing regions in India. The classification accuracy is assessed across 150 validation points spanning multiple blocks for the 2017 monsoon season. The Sentinel-1 SAR images acquired up to the early vegetative stage for rice have provided satisfactory classification accuracy with an overall accuracy >85% with kappa similar to 0.86 across different management practices throughout the region.
