DE massive videos; video management; cloud platform
AB With the rapid development of mobile internet and smart city, video surveillance is popular in areas such as transportation, schools, homes, and shopping malls. It is important subject to manage the massive videos quickly and accurately. This paper tries to use Hadoop cloud platform for massive video data storage, transcoding and retrieval. The key technologies of cloud computing and Hadoop are introduced firstly in the paper. Then, we analyze the functions of video management platform, such as user management, videos storage, videos transcoding, and videos retrieval. According to the basic functions and cloud computing, each module design process and figure are provided in the paper. The massive videos management system based on cloud platform will be better than the traditional videos management system in the aspects of storage capacity, transcoding performance and retrieval speed.
