AB The term data is new oil which has become a proverb due to large amount of data generation from various sources. Processing and storing such tremendous amount of data is beyond the capabilities of traditional computing system. Cloud computing preferably considered next-generation architecture due to dynamic resource pools, low cost, reliability, virtualization, and high availability. In cloud computing, one important issue is to track and record the origin of data objects which is known as data provenance. Major challenges to provenance management in distributed environment are privacy and security. This paper presents data provenance management for cloud computing using watermarking technique. The experiment is performed by using both visible and hidden watermarks on shared data objects stored in cloud computing environment. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and reliability of proposed technique.
