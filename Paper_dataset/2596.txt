AB With advancements in information and communication technology, there is a steep increase in the remote healthcare applications in which patients can get treatment from the remote places also. The data collected about the patients by remote healthcare applications constitute big data because it varies with volume, velocity, variety, veracity, and value. To process such a large collection of heterogeneous data is one of the biggest challenges which requires a specialized approach. To address this challenge, a new fuzzy rule based classifier is presented in this paper with an aim to provide Healthcare-as-a-Service. The proposed scheme is based upon the initial cluster formation, retrieval, and processing of the big data in cloud environment. Then, a fuzzy rule based classifier is designed for efficient decision making for data classification in the proposed scheme. To perform inferencing from the collected data, membership functions are designed for fuzzification and defuzzification processes. The proposed scheme is evaluated on various evaluation metrics, such as average response time, accuracy, computation cost, classification time, and false positive ratio. The results obtained confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme with respect to various performance evaluation metrics in cloud computing environment.
