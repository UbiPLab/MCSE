AB A novel model of Internet access networks is proposed, based on fog computing. The model hosts applications close to users by relying on virtual machines to dynamically move cloud or Web content to nodes located at the edge of access networks. Then it performs proactive caching and enforces traffic policies based on the interaction between access infrastructure and external applications. Analyzing experimental data collected from public Wi-Fi hotspots, the authors quantify this approach's benefits for optimizing bandwidth usage, reducing latency, and enhancing quality of experience. Experimental results show the fog-based approach can manage a significant portion of download data.
