AB Internet of Things (IoT), leveraging interconnected sensors (i.e., wireless body area network (WBAN), can offer opportunities for real time monitoring of patient health status and manage patients and treatment. Therefore, it is expected that IoT will play a significant role in the next-generation healthcare provisioning. Although IoT-based patient health status monitoring has become very popular, monitoring patients remotely outside of hospital settings requires augmenting the capabilities of IoT with other resources for health data storage and processing. In this paper, we propose an IoT-based service-oriented framework for continuous patient health status monitoring framework that connects WBAN through smartphones to cloud computing. We theoretically model the proposed framework, which is the first attempt in this direction, and study the behaviour of the proposed IoT-WBANs-based framework. Experimental evaluation based on the sensor lifetime, existing cost and energy consumption shows that the proposed framework substantially outperforms the baseline WBANs.
