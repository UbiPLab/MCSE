AB This article describes how in order to reduce the amount of data, deduplication technology is introduced in the cloud storage. Adopting this technology, the duplicated data can be eliminated, users can conserve the storage requirement. However, deduplication technology also increases the data unavailability. To solve this problem, the authors propose a method to improve data availability in the deduplication storage system. It is based on the data chunk reference count and access frequency, and increases redundant information for the data chunks, to ensure data availability and minimize storage overhead. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate effectiveness of the improved method. WFD, CDC, and sliding block deduplication technology are used for comparison. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve higher data availability than the conventional method and increase little storage overhead.
