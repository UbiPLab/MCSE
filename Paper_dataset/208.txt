ID CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS
AB The development of biometric applications, such as facial recognition (FR), has recently become important in smart cities. Many scientists and engineers around the world have focused on establishing increasingly robust and accurate algorithms and methods for these types of systems and their applications in everyday life. FR is developing technology with multiple real-time applications. The goal of this paper is to develop a complete FR system using transfer learning in fog computing and cloud computing. The developed system uses deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) because of the dominant representation; there are some conditions including occlusions, expressions, illuminations, and pose, which can affect the deep FR performance. DCNN is used to extract relevant facial features. These features allow us to compare faces between them in an efficient way. The system can be trained to recognize a set of people and to learn via an online method, by integrating the new people it processes and improving its predictions on the ones it already has. The proposed recognition method was tested with different three standard machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree (DT), K Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM)). The proposed system has been evaluated using three datasets of face images (SDUMLA-HMT, 113, and CASIA) via performance metrics of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and time. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superiority over other algorithms according to all parameters. The suggested algorithm results in higher accuracy (99.06%), higher precision (99.12%), higher recall (99.07%), and higher specificity (99.10%) than the comparison algorithms.
