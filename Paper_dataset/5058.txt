AB With the advent of the mobile network, the fusion of cloud computing and fog computing is becoming feasible to promise lower latency and short-fat connection. However, there are a lot of redundant cloud-aware services with identical functionalities but a different quality of service (QoS) in the fog cloud environment. In fact, since QoS information is stored in distributed fog servers rather than remote cloud, it is hard for individuals to make recommendation and selection with sparse QoS information. Collaborative filtering is an important method for the sparsity problems and has been widely adopted on the prediction of missing QoS values. Focusing on the fact that existing researchers often ignore the QoS fluctuation in a wide range in the fog cloud environment, a novel neighbor-based QoS prediction method is proposed for service recommendation, in which a concept and calculation method is put forward to describe the stable status of services and users with quantifiable QoS values, and a NearestGraph algorithm is further designed to recognize stable or unstable candidate along with their popularity by a nearest neighbor graph structure which can help to make missing QoS values prediction in a certain order to improve final prediction accuracy. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method is effective in predicting unknown QoS values in terms of service recommendation accuracy and efficiency.
