AB This paper surveys the literature of opportunistic offloading. Opportunistic offloading refers to offloading traffic originally transmitted through the cellular network to opportunistic network, or offloading computing tasks originally executed locally to nearby devices with idle computing resources through opportunistic network. This research direction is recently emerged, and the relevant research covers the period from 2009 to date, with an explosive trend over the last four years. We provide a comprehensive review of the research field from a multidimensional view based on application goal, realizing approach, offloading direction, etc. In addition, we pinpoint the major classifications of opportunistic offloading, so as to form a hierarchical or graded classification of the existing works. Specifically, we divide opportunistic offloading into two main categories based on application goal: traffic offloading or computation offloading. Each category is further divided into two smaller categories: with and without offloading node selection, which bridges between subscriber node and the cellular network, or plays the role of computing task executor for other nodes. We elaborate, compare, and analyze the literatures in each classification from the perspectives of required information, objective, etc. We present a complete introductory guide to the researches relevant to opportunistic offloading. After summarizing the development of the research direction and offloading strategies of the current state-of-the-art, we further point out the important future research problems and directions.
