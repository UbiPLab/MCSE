AB The supply of defect-free, high-quality products is an important success factor for the long-term competitiveness of manufacturing companies. Despite the increasing challenges of rising product variety and complexity and the necessity of economic manufacturing, a comprehensive and reliable quality inspection is often indispensable. In consequence, high inspection volumes turn inspection processes into manufacturing bottlenecks.
   In this contribution, we investigate a new integrated solution of predictive model-based quality inspection in industrial manufacturing by utilizing Machine Learning techniques and Edge Cloud Computing technology. In contrast to state-of-the-art contributions, we propose a holistic approach comprising the target-oriented data acquisition and processing, modelling and model deployment as well as the technological implementation in the existing IT plant infrastructure. A real industrial use case in SMT manufacturing is presented to underline the procedure and benefits of the proposed method. The results show that by employing the proposed method, inspection volumes can be reduced significantly and thus economic advantages can be generated.
