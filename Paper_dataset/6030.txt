AB Scheduling is a challenge that persists in the operational phase of the manufacturing life-cycle. The challenge can be attributed to the complex, dynamic, and stochastic nature of a manufacturing system. Computer simulation is often used to assist with scheduling, as it can sufficiently mimic complex, discrete, dynamic, stochastic processes. We propose an architecture of a real-time simulation scheduling system that incorporates the use of a sensorised-network of a job-shop, mobile devices, and cloud computing with simulation and scheduling methods. A simulation model is also created to describe the environment and operations of a job-shop.
