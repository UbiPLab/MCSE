AB The key of data mining algorithm in cloud computing environment is association rules and cluster analysis. The Apriori algorithm and K-means algorithm which are widely used nowadays have many problems such as long scanning time and large memory consumption. Therefore, a parallelized design scheme was proposed in this paper, which improved Apriori algorithm and K-means algorithm and was practiced by utilizing Hadoop platform, the feasibility of parallel project in massive data processing was discussed. The results showed that this proposed method could reduce the computational load of single node, reduce the computing time and improve the efficiency of the algorithm by repeating the calculation work on each node.
