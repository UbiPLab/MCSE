AB In this article, the authors have discussed about the connection between Internet of Things and growth of big data. They have also discussed short reference on the evolution, features, lifecycle, and implementation of Big Data from IoT over the cloud. Internet of Things represents a platform or environment that consists of enormous number of sensors and mediators interconnecting heterogeneous physical devices over the internet. IoT applications are available in many real-world areas such as smart city, smart workplace, smart home, smart transportation and various other ubiquitous computing areas. Using IoT applications generates tremendous amount of data for storage and management in the internet. With the time and research evolution integration of the IoT platforms and cloud comes in the market and IoT platforms data storage and management started shifting to the cloud from the internet connected physical systems for many real-world application areas. Meanwhile when this data becomes huge termed as Big Data. Handling of Big Data over the cloud develops many new areas of research and attention.
