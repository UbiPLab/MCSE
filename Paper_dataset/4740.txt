AB Due to the promotion of cloud computing and the massive access of mobile Internet, the cloud radio access network has become a promising solution for the mobile network in 5G communication system. With the increasing of the local applications, plenty of traffic is produced from the centralized cloud computing which leads to a heavy pressure to the fronthaul network. In order to avoid the traffic flood, fog-based radio over optical fiber networks (F-RoFN) as a promising extend solution for cloud radio access network provides better performances and lower cost taking advantage of fog computing in our previous work. In the scenarios of analog and digital F-RoFNs, the collapse caused by disaster is an important factor which threats network survivability and would result in enormous interrupt of users services. Since a number of applications need high-quality connections, it is necessary to guarantee the quality of services in case of collapse in F-RoFNs. On the basis of it, this paper proposes a bandwidth compression protection (BCP) algorithm against collapse in the fog-based wireless and optical networks to improve the network performances and guarantee the survivability in case of collapse with analog and digital scenarios. The resource efficiency of the whole network can be promoted with reducing the redundancy appropriately, while BCP algorithm classifies the level of services and further compresses the bandwidth of backup path occupied by the low-level services. The performances of the proposed algorithm are evaluated and compared with the conventional protection algorithm by the means of extensive simulations. The numeric results show that the proposed BCP algorithm can guarantee the network survivability with the lower blocking probability, higher resource utilization and less average hop than the other algorithm.
