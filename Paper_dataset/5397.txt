AB Recently, to provide a low-latency mobile computing platform, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is proposed. In this paper, we first summarized the feature capabilities of MEC, such as content distribution and caching, computational offloading and multimedia Internet of Things (IoT). Then, to understand recent research efforts of multimedia MEC, we briefly highlight the research efforts in terms of above three capabilities: how to achieve edge caching in video distribution, how to schedule computational offloading to the cloud and how the communication quality degradation affects to the user experience of multimedia IoT. Finally, we addressed the emerging research issues of multimedia MEC to improve reliability and robustness of multimedia MEC.
