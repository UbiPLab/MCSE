ID EVALUATION MODEL
AB Cloud manufacturing is an emerging manufacturing model that applies some concepts and technologies of cloud computing, in which massive manufacturing resources are offered over the internet as on-demand, personalized customization services. While one of the technology bottlenecks in this model is estimation of trust value for manufacturing resources, especially a various number of machine tools (MTs). In this paper, the statistical index system of MTs is developed to quantify the trust value of MTs in the cloud environment. An estimation method based on TOPSIS is proposed to obtain real-time trust statistic of MTs. Finally, a simulation case is conducted to assess the performance of the proposed method.
