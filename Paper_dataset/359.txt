AB Driven by the ever-increasing demands of vehicular services, edge computing has become a promising paradigm to facilitate edge services in vehicular networks by using edge computing devices (ECDs). To enhance the service experience, we develop a reservation service framework, where the reservation service request of a vehicle needs to be relayed to one of the ECDs which is ahead of its driving direction. However, due to the various behaviors of vehicles, not all the vehicles are trustworthy and willing to join in the service request relay process. Therefore, how to exploit the cooperation between ECDs and vehicles to relay the service request by considering the dynamic traffic status and the behaviors of vehicles becomes a challenge. As an effort to address this problem, we propose a trusted relay selection scheme for edge services to facilitate the proposed reservation service framework. Specifically, we first design the request relay mechanism based on the dynamic traffic status to guarantee the efficiency of the relay process. Then, the reputation management mechanism is presented to constrain the behaviors of vehicles, where a vehicle with high reputation value can enjoy the price discount for computing service. Based on the designed request relay and reputation management mechanisms, a reputation-based auction approach is then proposed to select relay vehicles (RVs) to reduce the cost of the relay service. Simulation results show that the proposed reservation service framework can manage vehicles efficiently and lead to the lowest cost for the relay services compared with the conventional schemes.
