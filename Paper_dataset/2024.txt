AB Complex workflow applications are widely used in scientific computing and economic analysis, which commonly include both preemptive and non-preemptive tasks. Cloud computing provides a convenient way for users to access different resources based on the "pay-as-you-go" model. However, different resource renting alternatives (reserved, on-demand or spot) are usually provided by the service provider. The spot instances provide a dynamic and cheaper alternative comparing to the on-demand one. However, failures often occur due to the fluctuations of the price of the instance. It is a big challenge to determine the appropriate amount of spot and on-demand resources for workflow applications with both preemptive and non-preemptive tasks. In this paper, the workflow scheduling problem with both spot and on-demand instances is considered. The objective is to minimize the total renting cost under deadline constrains. An idle time block-based method is proposed for the considered problem. Different idle time block based searing and improving strategies are developed to construct schedules for workflow applications. Schedules are improved by a forward and backward moving mechanism. Experimental and statistical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm over a lot of tests with different sizes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
