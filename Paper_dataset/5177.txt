AB With the development of network-enabled sensors and artificial intelligence algorithms, various human-centered smart systems are proposed to provide services with higher quality, such as smart healthcare, affective interaction, and autonomous driving. Considering cognitive computing is an indispensable technology to develop these smart systems, this paper proposes human-centered computing assisted by cognitive computing and cloud computing. First, we provide a comprehensive investigation of cognitive computing, including its evolution from knowledge discovery, cognitive science, and big data. Then, the system architecture of cognitive computing is proposed, which consists of three critical technologies, i.e., networking (e.g., Internet of Things), analytics (e.g., reinforcement learning and deep learning), and cloud computing. Finally, it describes the representative applications of human-centered cognitive computing, including robot technology, emotional communication system, and medical cognitive system.
