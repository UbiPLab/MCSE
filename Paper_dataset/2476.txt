AB With the rapid spread of cloud computing and ever increasing big data generated by Internet of Things (IoT), remote user authentication poses the biggest challenge. Internet of Things is a paradigm where every device in the Internet Infrastructure (II) is interconnected into a global dynamic expanding network. This paper proposes a novel remote user authentication scheme for cloud-IoT applications. The scheme is lightweight and robust to attacks and also has low computational overhead. The proposed scheme satisfies the desired essential attributes of security. A formal verification performed using AVISPA tool confirms the security of the proposed scheme. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
