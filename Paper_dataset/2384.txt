AB Emerging cyber-physical systems (CPS) field will impact on every activity of the daily life in the next few years With the increasing advances in ICT information communication technology (ICT), multidisciplinary fields of research such as cyber-physical systems (CPS) have been wide. The emergence of cyber-physical-social systems (CPS) as a novel paradigm has revolutionized the relationship between humans, computers and the physical environment. This paper aims to present a comprehensive overview of CPS key aspects from different points of views such as design, methodology, and key enabler technologies such as sensor networks, Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and multi-agent systems. Also, some important applications such as smart cities which are considered as one of the important application that will provide new services for healthcare applications, vehicular networks, energy distribution, the monitoring of environmental changes, business and commerce applications, emergency response, and other social activities and industrial systems are explored. Also, this paper considers the requirements and methodologies for CPS integrations such as CloudIoT and CloudIoV systems. Although, there are significant efforts and studies have been made towards CPS application, key challenges and problems in CPS have been identified in this paper to be considered as research issues the next few years.
