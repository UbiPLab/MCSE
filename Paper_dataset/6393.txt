AB Cloud computing has gained enormous popularity by providing high availability and scalability as well as on-demand services. However, with the continuous rise of energy consumption cost, the virtualized environment of cloud data centers poses a challenge to today's power monitoring system. Software-based power monitoring is gaining prevalence since power models can work precisely by exploiting soft computing methodologies like genetic programming and swarm intelligence for model optimization. However, traditional power models barely consider virtualization and have drawbacks like high error rate, low feasibility as well as insufficient scalability. In this paper, we first analyze the power signatures of virtual machines in different configurations through experiments. Then we propose a virtual machine (VM) power model, named CAM, which is able to adapt to the reconfiguration of VMs and provide accurate power estimating under CPU-intensive workload. We also propose two training methodologies corresponding to two typical situations for model training. CAM can estimate the power of a single VM as well as a physical server hosting several heterogeneous VMs. We exploited public Linux benchmarks to evaluate CAM. The experimental results show that CAM produced very small errors in power estimating for both VMs (4.26% on average) and the host server (0.88% on average).
