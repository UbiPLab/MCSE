AB While traditional vehicle network communication architecture is based on special short-range communication, it is difficult to meet the demand for quality of service of vehicle networking data transmission. The relevant data can be uploaded to the server through the mobile gateway, which can be transmitted to the target vehicle by the decision of the server, which can then extend the data broadcast domain and greatly reduce the time delay of data transmission. Combined with the idea of mobile cloud services, a new network architecture and data transmission method is proposed in this paper. We first describe the specific process of the gateway service to the registration of cloud service information. Secondly, we propose a method to select the cloud service gateway. The method combines historical cloud data and real-time data, and dynamically determines the gateway service provider and the service scope of the service. Gateway access to services consumers in broadcast news, they considered the communication load, stability link channel quality and other performance parameters to select the best gateway service provider, and then transmitted the data to the gateway service provider and uploaded it to their cloud. Finally, the transmission performance of the proposed method is evaluated for different traffic scenarios. The results show that the proposed method can obtain a shorter transmission delay and ensure a higher transmission success rate and the theoretical analysis herein proves the validity of the method.
