AB With the development of cloud computing technology, a heavy workload and the considerable amount of energy consumed create significant pressure on the cloud service providers. However, in the open sharing mobile Internet, many devices are idle in the network, and a large amount of resource is wasted. This study proposes a new model based on the idea of crowdfunding, which can be a supplement to the traditional resource supply mode. With this model, users can contribute their spare resource to cloud service providers to perform cloud tasks and receive preferential pricing when they require resource. A reward and punishment mechanism is designed based on the repeated game to encourage users to contribute their spare resource and to monitor the cloud service provider to ensure that supporters can receive a preferential price in return. MATLAB simulation results show that the new model reduces the overall energy consumption, and the incentive mechanism is available to motivate supporters to actively perform cloud tasks.
