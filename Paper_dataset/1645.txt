AB Recently, the electronic heath record (EHR) has become the chosen method to maintain a patient's health information. The advancement of cloud computing enables users to access their data with flexibility, providing large storage capability at low costs, which encourages EHR maintainers to consider shifting from their own storage to the cloud. In cloud computing, it is no doubt that securing EHRs poses a gigantic challenge. Various security properties like access control, data privacy, and scalable access between different clouds needs to be satisfied. This article presents a secure and efficient blueprint for securing data confidentiality on cloud computing storage. The proposed framework is carried out for EHR confidential data on cloud storage. Moreover, the proposed approach combines the obfuscation and RSA encryption together to enforce confidentiality and authentication. Through this framework, the data confidentiality and authentication scheme on EHR information can be enforced on clouds storage.
