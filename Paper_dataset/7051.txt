AB Cloud computing and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) use cases proposed by ETSI can improve network caching when an adequate optimization algorithm is used. A cache placement algorithm is proposed based on these virtualization tools. Moreover, a cache placement protocol is presented to support the cache migration. Optimal cache and Virtual Machine (VM) placement and migration, and optimal routing based on several new constraints such as system load, network infrastructure, user satisfaction and migration cost is designed. Extensive evaluations and comparison to state of the art techniques are carried out. The results show that our cache techniques outperform other solutions and give better satisfaction to the three constituents: users, network operators and content providers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.
