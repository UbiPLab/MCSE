AB Due to physical limitations, mobile devices are restricted in memory, battery, processing, among other characteristics. This results in many applications that cannot be run in such devices. This problem is fixed by Edge Cloud Computing, where the users offload tasks they cannot run to cloudlet servers in the edge of the network. The main requirement of such a system is having a low Service Delay, which would correspond to a high Quality of Service. This paper presents a method for minimizing Service Delay in a scenario with two cloudlet servers. The method has a dual focus on computation and communication elements, controlling Processing Delay through virtual machine migration and improving Transmission Delay with Transmission Power Control. The foundation of the proposal is a mathematical model of the scenario, whose analysis is used on a comparison between the proposed approach and two other conventional methods; these methods have single focus and only make an effort to improve either Transmission Delay or Processing Delay, but not both. As expected, the proposal presents the lowest Service Delay in all study cases, corroborating our conclusion that a dual focus approach is the best way to tackle the Service Delay problem in Edge Cloud Computing.
