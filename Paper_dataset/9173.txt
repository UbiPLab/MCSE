AB Cloud Computing (CC) is a technology that surely brings innovations in today's business world, more and more companies around the world are widely incorporating this technology into their businesses. From a technical, as well as organizational point of view transferring enterprise IT to the Cloud is a complex task. Various factors have to be taken into consideration in order to make a right choice when moving IT services to the Cloud.
   The goal of this paper is to identify and to discuss in detail all factors that influence organization's decision to adopt Cloud. General model for Cloud adoption, introduced in Pantelic et al. [13](a), consists of the key factors driving the organizational benefits when moving to the Cloud. The purpose of the model is to support decision makers in evaluating the benefits, risks and costs of using Cloud Computing. In this paper the general model is extended with two new aggregation methods for harmonization of alternatives rankings in a group decision process. We present the results of two new methods using the method results from previous research [13], as rank inputs, into an aggregate (group) preference. The idea is to find consensus ranking that minimizes disagreement among previous methods results.
   There were no strong differences between the results of performed methods. The results have shown that Software as a service model and Storage as a service model dominated according to not just arithmetic-mean method, but also to geometric-mean method.
