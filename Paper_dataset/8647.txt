   extensible local access networks (VxLAN)
AB Nowadays, cloud computing networks significantly benefit the deployment of new services and have become one infrastructure provider in the digital society. The virtual extensible local area network (VxLAN), which belongs to the network schemes to overlay Layer 2 over Layer 3, is one of the most popular methods to realize cloud computing networks. Though VxLAN partially overcomes the capacity limitation of its predecessor virtual local area network, it still faces several challenges like annoying signaling overhead during the multicast period and interrupted communication with a migrating virtual machine (VM). In this paper, we propose a new software defined network (SDN) based VxLAN network architecture. Based on this architecture, we address how we can deploy an intelligent center to enhance the multicast capability and facilitate the VM migration. Besides, we discuss the means to update the global information and guarantee the communication continuum. Finally, we use Mininet to emulate this SDN based VxLAN architecture and demonstrate effective load balancing results. In a word, this proposed architecture could provide a blueprint for future cloud computing networks.
