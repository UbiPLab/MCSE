AB Inspired by the approach of smart pirates dealing with their treasures, the paper proposed a scheme to protect the data security and privacy in cloud computing. In the proposed scheme, cloud data will be divided into some sequenced or logical blocks. These data blocks will be distributed among cloud storage service providers. Instead of protecting the data themselves, the proposed scheme protects the mapping of the data elements on each provider. Comprehensive analysis and simulation are designed to verify the proposed scheme, the results show that it is secure for cloud data, and the real implementation on Amazon S3 also indicates that the proposed scheme is feasible and efficient for the cloud data storage.
