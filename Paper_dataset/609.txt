AB The existing geological disaster monitoring and early warning system has the problems of large monitoring errors and low accuracy. This paper designs a geological disaster monitoring and early warning system based on big data analysis. The geological disaster monitoring network module monitors the geological deformation and disaster inducing factors in real time through sensors and transmits them to the large-capacity data remote wireless transmission network module in the multi-dimensional heterogeneous monitoring data integration module through the Beidou satellite communication technology. This module uses a multi-sensor data fusion algorithm based on the D-S evidence theory and fuzzy mathematics to realize the integration of geological multi-dimensional heterogeneous monitoring data. Then, it uses cloud computing-based geological abnormal data mining method to mine abnormal geological information and transmit it to the early warning information release module. Geological disaster warning information will be released in the form of text messages and emails. Through verification, the system has high accuracy in monitoring and early warning of different types of geological disasters and provides a basis for timely and scientific deployment of geological disasters.
