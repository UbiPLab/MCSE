AB Using the time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approach, where the condensate is coupled with the thermal cloud and the anomalous density, we study the equilibrium and the dynamical properties of three-dimensional quantum-degenerate Bose gas at finite temperature. Effects of the anomalous correlations on the condensed fraction and the critical temperature are discussed. In uniform Bose gas, useful expressions for the Bogoliubov excitations spectrum, the first and second sound, the condensate depletion and the superfluid fraction are derived. Our results are tested by comparing the findings computed by quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We present also a systematic investigation of the collective modes of a Bose condensate confined in an external trap. Our predictions are in qualitative agreement with previous experimental and theoretical results. We show in particular that our theory is capable of explaining the so-called anomalous behavior of the m = 0 mode.
