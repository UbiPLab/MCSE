AB Cloud storage is the lower layer of the cloud computing system that supports other layers above it. Up to now the likes of Google, Microsoft, IBM, and Amazon have been providing cloud storage services. Since its efficient way to store and manage important data, the offer of free storage attracts researchers. As a result, cloud storage research will not only track trends, but will also have high application value. Therefore, this paper, introduces a novel model of data storage and backup in cloud storage, that optimally combines customer storage resources with service providers, so that redundancy, storage strategy and configuration properties can be adjusted adequately to the needs of the storage service consumer. In this paper, we review two of the backup technologies (Snapshot and D2D), that are used in this model. In addition, the first contribution is bound to both determining consumer requirements and choosing the provider. Next-life cycle and phases of preparation model for data storage services. Furthermore, we present place and form of the model in cloud storage architecture. The model aims to increase the availability of data and reduces the loss of data in storage environments.
