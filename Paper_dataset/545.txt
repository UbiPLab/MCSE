AB Energy management focuses on improving the efficient use of resources and increasing energy access in a path towards a more sustainable society. In spite of the strategies that have been proposed to guarantee increased access to the energy resources at affordable costs, there are still challenges to ensure the conservation of the resources and the protection of the environment. In line with these objectives, Cloud Computing for Smart Energy Management project (CC-SEM) is a research effort for building an integrated platform for smart monitoring, controlling, and planning energy consumption and generation in urban scenarios. CC-SEM includes, firstly, the design of a low-cost IoT device capable of monitoring, operating, and controlling home appliances according to predefined rules. It was developed with the aim of automatically manage consumption. Secondly, an analysis of 5G Narrowband IoT as a suitable cellular technology for Smart Grid outage restoration and management message delivery was addressed. Thirdly, an analysis of domestic consumption patterns was carried out to help to predict home consumption, using literature measurements. Fourthly, within the context of electrical network simulation, a forecasting and performance evaluation methodology for the generation of individual photovoltaic systems is proposed. In summary, CC-SEM presents the research efforts to provide a set of tools for controlling home devices, planning/simulating scenarios of energy generation, and to propose advances in the communication infrastructure for transmitting the generated data.
