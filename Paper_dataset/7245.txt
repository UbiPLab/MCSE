AB The smart devices are extremely useful devices that are making our lives easier than before. A smart device is facilitated us to establish a connection with another smart device in a wireless network with a decentralized approach. The mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a novel methodology that discovers neighborhood devices and establishes connection among them without centralized infrastructure. Cloud provides service to the MANET users to access cloud and communicates with another MANET users. In this article, I integrated MANET and cloud together and formed a new mobility model named Cloud-MANET. In this mobility model, if one smart device of MANET is able to connect to the internet then all smart devices are enabled to use cloud service and can be interacted with another smart device in the Cloud-MANET framework. A middleware acts as an interface between MANET and cloud. The objective of this article is to implement a middleware in Cloud-MANET mobility model for communication on internet of smart devices.
