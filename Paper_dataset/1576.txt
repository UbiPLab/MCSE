AB The idea of a Smart City features the need to upgrade quality, interconnection and execution of different urban administrations with the utilization of data and correspondence advances (ICT). Smart City advances cloud-based and Internet of Things (IoT) based administrations in which certifiable user interface utilize PDAs, sensors and RFIDs. Distributed computing and IoT are by and by two most essential ICT models that are forming the up and coming age of registering. Cloud computing speaks to the new technique for conveying equipment and programming assets to the clients, Internet of Things (IoT) is at present a standout amongst the most well-known ICT ideal models. In the meantime, the IoT idea imagines another age of gadgets (sensors, both virtual and physical) that are associated with the Internet and give diverse administrations to esteem included applications. Focus of this study attention on the integration of Cloud, IoT and IoE technologies for smart city services as well as a review has been made so that we can develop a better smart city that will utilize IoT, IoE in order to provide a better platform for smart city. This paper tends to the joined area of cloud computing, IoT and IoE for any smart city application organization.
