ID SMART; SERVICE
AB V2G technology is considered a powerful approach enabling renewable energy sources to provide ancillary electrical services, and managing and monitoring power usage in the smart grid. However, owing to the inherent high mobility of EVs, flexible and timely on-demand response services against EV mobility in the V2G system must be provided. Promoted by the advantages of 5G communications, e.g., supporting various connectivity and faster transmission, fogs and clouds are enabled to provide realistic services, and fog computing and cloud computing assisted V2G systems in future 5G mobile networks are expected to be a new paradigm to create a new situation for V2G services. To this end, a fog-based and cloud-based hybrid computing model named "Foud" applied to V2G networks in 5G is proposed. The potential V2G network services provided by Foud are reviewed, and open issues and challenges for future work are also discussed with possible solutions.
