AB Suppliers, partners, companies and dealers in supply chains do use, generate and share information with others. These associations lead to a multitude of challenges and opportunities within the supply chains. A Digital Supply Chain (DSC) is a smart, value-driven, efficient process to generate new forms of revenue and business value for organizations and to leverage new approaches with novel technological and analytical methods DSC is not about whether goods and services are digital or physical, it is about the way how supply chain processes are managed with a wide variety of innovative technologies, e.g. unmanned aerial vehicles, cloud computing, and internet of things, among others. Recent literature highlights the importance of DSC and many industrial researchers discuss its applications. This article reviews the stateof-the-art of existing DSC literature in detail from both academic and industrial points of view. It identifies key limitations and prospects in DSC, summarizes prior research and identifies knowledge gaps by providing advantages, weaknesses and limitations of individual methods The article also aims at providing a development framework as a roadmap for future research and practice.
