AB Cloud computing is used in almost all domains today. Through the use of cloud-based applications, it has become easier for an internet user to make use of the services and resources that are widely available. The cloud service provider undertakes to deliver all the subscribers' requirements as per the service level agreement (SLA). These resources must be well-protected since they are used by many subscribers. There is a constant high level of demand for these resources and services, and it is therefore necessary to balance the loads on the various servers; this is done in order to avoid congestion in the network and to reduce consumption of the capital or resources. This load balancing uses algorithms such as genetic algorithms (GA) in order to distribute the load on the virtual machines (VM) that are available in the network. A novel load balancing method is proposed, involving a well-organized use of resources, which is known as the dynamic well-organized load balancing (DWOLB) algorithm. This is a powerful algorithm for reducing the energy that is consumed in cloud computing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
