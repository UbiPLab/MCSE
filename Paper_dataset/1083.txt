AB Although the real-time migration of virtual machines brings about multi-functional management, the service performance will decline to a certain extent during the migration process, so shorter downtime and total migration time are very desirable. The traditional load balancing algorithm reflect the load information of each physical machine, but it does not take into account the actual case of virtual machine migration. Therefore, contraposing to the features of cloud computing, the destination node positioning strategy of cloud computing is proposed. It periodically acquires physical node's CPU, memory, bandwidth usage and request connection and perform quantification with unified standard. Then, with computation of factors of virtual machine migration the comprehensive load value is determined finally. The approach measures the utilization rate and transfer cost of node computing resources, which can locate target nodes reasonably and efficiently, so it ensures the reasonable and efficient migration of virtual machines and relative load balancing under cloud computing environments.
