DE Virtual networks; Fault-tolerance; OpenStack; Fault analysis
AB OpenStack is arguably the most popular open-source cloud orchestration software available today. Its user-base spans from large corporations and large scale service providers to SMEs. OpenStack manages infrastructure resources e.g. compute, storage and networking. While customers get a fully functional cloud, an incumbent fault-tolerance analysis and suggestion system is absent from this otherwise robust cloud management system. In this work, we demonstrate a system for automated fault-tolerance (FT) analysis of network applications hosted on OpenStack. Faults are modeled by random server and/or service shutdowns. Aim of the FT Analyzer is to equip cloud tenants with information to determine optimum configuration for their applications before firing up the service. FT Analyzer helps tenants maintain maximum up-time for services and data and preemptively tests the virtual network based applications for any issues that can have a negative impact on performance in post deployment scenario.
