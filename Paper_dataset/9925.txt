DE Cloud computing; bandwidth guarantee; resource allocation
AB With the tremendous growth of cloud computing, it is increasingly critical to provide quantifiable performance to tenants and to improve resource utilization for the cloud provider. Though many recent proposals focus on guaranteeing job performance (with a particular note on network bandwidth) in the cloud, they usually lack efficient utilization of cloud resource, or vice versa. In this paper we present DCloud, which leverages the (soft) deadlines of cloud computing jobs to enable flexible and efficient resource utilization in data centers. With the deadline requirement of a job guaranteed, DCloud employs both time sliding (postponing the launching time of a job) and bandwidth scaling (adjusting the bandwidth associated with VMs) in resource allocation, so as to better match the resource allocated to the job with the cloud's residual resource. Extensive simulations and testbed experiments show that DCloud can accept much more jobs than existing solutions, and significantly increase the cloud provider's revenue with less cost for individual tenants.
