AB Cloud computing is an emerging model in which computing facilities are provided as a service and accessed using Internet hence organizations prefer data outsourcing to the cloud servers. Currently, organizations produce a large amount of data and expect increased availability, scalability and security. When data is migrated to cloud, security and availability of the data must be verified since the critical data of the organizations lies outside the data owner premises. To enhance the availability of the data the data owners prefer replicating data to more than one cloud servers. Thus there will be pre-defined SLAs between the cloud service provider (CSP) and the data owners that include payment of fees measured in terms of GB per month for data replication. We need to have a protocol which ensures that the cloud service provider is replicating the data storage based on the pre defined SLAs. In this paper we propose a protocol called "Secure Provable Data Possession scheme with Replication support in the Cloud using Tweaks" that prevents the CSP cheating the data owner by maintaining fewer replicas than the agreed one in the SLAs and also supports dynamic data operations. We illustrate the performance of our scheme with experimental analysis and prove that it performs better than the existing systems.
