AB This article describes how in volunteer cloud computing systems, some resources are volunteered by the hosts. These systems became more powerful and attractive because they provide a highest power computing. However, to satisfy the user requirements and the system performance in this kind of the system is a crucial challenge. In this article, the authors propose a new architecture for the volunteer cloud computing systems to allow balancing the load between volunteer clouds in a decentralized manner, and between resources inside a volunteer cloud in centralized manner. Moreover, their proposal shows more advantages: First, selecting a resource according to the user requirements and to the system performance. Second, estimating the volunteer resource failure probability by using the stochastic process Markov chain model. Experimental results using the PeerSim Simulator is established to verify the efficacy of the proposed system and promising results are obtained.
