AB The mobile botnet is a collection of compromised mobile devices that can remotely receive commands from the botmaster. Exploiting unique features of mobile networks and smartphones, mobile botnets pose a severe threat to mobile users, because smartphones have become an indispensable part of our daily lives and carried a lot of private information. With the development of cloud computing technologies, botmaster can utilize ubiquitous cloud technologies to construct robust and scalable C&C (command and control) channel for mobile botnet. In this paper, we propose Cloudbot, a novel mobile botnet, which outperforms existing mobile botnets in terms of robustness, controllability, scalability, and stealthiness. Although the basic idea of using cloud technologies seems straightforward, we explore the design space of exploiting such services and tackle several challenging issues to overcome the limitations of existing mobile botnets. We have implemented CloudBot by exploiting popular push services and cloud storage services, and evaluated it through extensive experiments. The results demonstrate not only the feasibility of CloudBot but also its advantages, such as stealthiness, robustness, and performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
