AB Host load prediction is significant for improving resource allocation and utilization in cloud computing. Due to the higher variance than that in a grid, accurate prediction remains a challenge in the cloud system. In this paper, we apply a concise yet adaptive and powerful model called long short-term memory to predict the mean load over consecutive future time intervals and actual load multi-step-ahead. Two real-world load traces were used to evaluate the performance. One is the load trace in the Google data center, and the other is that in a traditional distributed system. The experiment results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance with higher accuracy in both datasets.
