AB Cloud computing technology in the epoch of large data, which subvert the traditional data computing storage model completely, it is a new type of computing service model. And an increasing number of individuals become the subscribers of the cloud computing, the size of the data center is also growing, the problem of the low utilization of resource and high energy consumption are serious. Then how can we use resources efficiently, reduce energy consumption and improve service quality for the large data center. It is an important method to improve the performance of the entire cloud computing server cluster by the improvement of the cloud computing platform. This paper has studied in-depth research on mainstream open source cloud computing platforms such as OpenStackand improved the resource scheduling mechanism which existed. The works are composed of two parts: the virtual machine initial placement mechanism based on resource performance perceptionand the dynamic migration mechanism of virtual machine based on load perception.
