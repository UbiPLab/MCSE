ID DUAL SYSTEM ENCRYPTION; SUBSET; HIBE
AB Searchable public key encryption- (SPE-) supporting keyword search plays an important role in cloud computing for data confidentiality. The current SPE scheme mainly supports conjunctive or disjunctive keywords search which belongs to very basic query operations. In this paper, we propose an efficient and secure SPE scheme that supports Boolean keywords search, which is more advanced than the conjunctive and disjunctive keywords search. We first develop a keyword conversion method, which can change the index and Boolean keywords query into a group of vectors. Then, through applying a technique so-called dual pairing vector space to encrypt the obtained vectors, we propose a concrete scheme proven to be secure under chosen keyword attack. Finally, we put forward a detailed theoretical and experimental analysis to demonstrate the efficiency of our scheme.
