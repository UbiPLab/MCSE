AB Safely avoiding accident prone routes is vital to maintain safe and intelligent transportation. Real-time crowd sourcing of accident causing factors (eg, icy roads, rain slicked road patches) combined with historical accident information can be utilized by intelligent navigation systems to avoid accident prone routes. A vehicle cloud can compute such safe routes and react faster than a centralized service given crowd-sourced data such as images, sensor readings, and so on. However, in addition to the intelligent routing, the security and privacy of each data owner must be provided as well. Additionally, crowdsourced information must be validated in the vehicular cloud. In this paper, we examine approaches to ensure safe, secure, and private vehicular clouds.
