AB Multicenter clinical trials that use positron emission tomography (PET) imaging frequently rely on stable bias in imaging biomarkers to assess drug effectiveness. Many well-documented factors cause variability in PET intensity values. Two of the largest scanner-dependent errors are scanner calibration and reconstructed image resolution variations. For clinical trials, an increase measurement error significantly increases the number of patient scans needed. We aim to provide a robust quality assurance system using portable PET/computed tomography "pocket" phantoms and automated image analysis algorithms with the goal of reducing PET measurement variability. A set of the "pocket" Phantoms was scanned with Patients, affixed to the underside of a patient bed. Our software analyzed the obtained images and estimated the image parameters. The analysis consisted of 2 steps, automated phantom detection and estimation of PET image resolution and global bias. Performance of the algorithm was tested under variations in image bias, resolution, noise, and errors in the expected sphere size. A web-loosed application was implemented to deploy the image analysis pipeline in a cloud-based infrastructure to support multicenter data acquisition, under Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model. The automated detection algorithm localized the phantom reliably. Simulation results showed stable behavior when image properties and input parameters were varied. The PET "pocket" phantom has the potential to reduce and/or check for standardized uptake value measurement errors.
