AB Cloud computing has redefined the way in which Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) and Web geoportals are designed, managed, and maintained. The cloudification of a geoportal represents the migration of a full-stack geoportal application to an internet-based private or public cloud. This work introduces two generic and open cloud-based architectures for auto-scalable Web geoportals, illustrated with the use case of the cloudification efforts of the Swiss academic geoportal GeoVITe. The presented cloud-based architectural designs for auto-scalable Web geoportals consider the most important functional and non-functional requirements and are adapted to both public and private clouds. The availability of such generic cloud-based architectures advances the cloudification of academic SDIs and geoportals.
