AB The application of E-learning is increased nowadays for various academic purposes. The combination of cloud computing, along with the E-learning, has emerged recently as a novel technique for managing and delivering the E-learning services. Sharing of data in between the cloud storage and the E-learning platform is mandatory in order to make sure that the user's needs are satisfied and also to enhance the standard of the services provided by this learning platform. Though, various researches have been done in the past for improving the security and privacy of this cloud-based Learning method, and complete accuracy is not achieved. In this paper, a novel framework for providing the security and privacy of the cloud-based E-learning platform is provided. The main objective of this work is to use intelligent agent-based systems for providing data security and privacy. The aim of our work is to identify an architecture that will be using Cloud Computing within higher education. The proposed framework comprises of various agents such as the user interface agent and the authentication agent with intelligent and distinct working features. These agents make effective communication between users, E-service providers, and the cloud-based system. This system monitors the data flow between the user, the E-learning platform, and the cloud-based systems focus on various security and privacy concerns that the E-healthcare environment is facing.
