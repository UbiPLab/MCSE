AB Mobile Fog Computing (MFC), as a crucial supplement to cloud computing, has its own special traits in many aspects. As smart mobile devices grow and vary in shapes and formats over the years, the need for real-time interactions and an easy-to-use network is imminent. In this paper, we propose a smart collaborative policy for MFC scenarios by considering the target of rural vitalization. The challenges and drawbacks of extending cloud to fog are reviewed at the beginning. Then, the analysis of policy design is presented from the perspectives of feature comparisons, urgent requirements, and possible solutions. The details of policy establishment are introduced with necessary examples. Finally, performance evaluations are provided based on simulation platforms. Validation results related to round trip time and transmission time illustrate the significant improvements of our proposal in certain ways compared to the original candidate, which enables larger deployment in impoverished areas.
