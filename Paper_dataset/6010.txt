AB Cloud computing is a style of technology that is increasingly used every day. It requires the use of an important amount of resources that is dynamically provided as a service. The growth of energy consumption associated to the process of resource allocation implemented in the cloud computing is an important issue that needs to be taken into consideration. Better performance will be acquired by allowing the same required workload to be performed using a lower number of servers, which could bring to important energy savings. So it is a requirement to adopt efficient techniques in order to save and minimize energy consumed clouds such as virtual machines migration. This paper analyzes two algorithms: First Fit and Ant Colony which address the use of virtual machine migration approaches to improve the cloud performance in terms of reducing the consumed energy.
