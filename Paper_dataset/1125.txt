AB Latest scientific application and simulation are requiring powerful computing resources. To get the sufficient resources, more and more computer experts are constructing high-end supercomputer, cluster computing or cloud computing. Although most corporations are starting to use high performance computing by organizing cluster, they rarely add some extra resources dynamically when computing power is not sufficient. In addition, they are also expensive to use insufficient resources as cloud computing resources. To overcome resource limitations when using cloud computing to conduct large computations, we exploit underutilized personal desktops by organizing a heterogeneous cluster environment. An open-source based scheduler, Son of Grid Engine (SGE) is provided in the integrated environment to manage or control the extra computing resources. Two kinds of groups are classified according to the individuals degree of utilization: a full-time group that provides resources at any time, and a custom-time group that provides resources only at designated times. We developed a resource manager that can turn on/off and schedule the SGE execution daemon; this manager performs as the core engine. The resource running time manager efficiently allocates and controls the members of affiliated computing resources.
