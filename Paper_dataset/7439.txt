AB Aiming at the phenomenon of false information issued by service providers in cloud computing environment, a method for service evaluation based on fuzzy theory is put forward in this paper. According to the quality of services provided by cloud service providers and their behavior during interactions, a trust relationship between cloud service providers and cloud service consumers is established, which can be quantified by using fuzzy theory. The quality of services is evaluated by drawing on the trust relationship. In our method, the recommendation credibility of a cloud service consumer is determined through behavior similarity with evaluators and a praise factor. The introduction of the praise factor better suits the phenomenon of a high-quality service getting more repeat customers. The negative impact of dishonest customers is reduced, and the accuracy of trust and cloud service quality evaluation is improved by introducing a confidence factor that can be dynamically adjusted. The experimental results show that our method can effectively and accurately evaluate the trust value and service quality of providers, while weakening the influence of dishonest consumers, and quickly detect dishonest service providers. This is beneficial for consumers trying to find high quality service providers for similar services.
