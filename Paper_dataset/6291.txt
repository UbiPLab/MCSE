AB MultiVersion concurrency control is maintained over transactional database systems for secure, fast and efficient access to the shared data file implementation scenario. Most of the services and application offered in cloud world are real-time, which entails optimized compatibility service environment between master and slave clusters. In the paper, offered methodology supports replication and triggering methods intended for data consistency and dynamicity. Here, cluster based communication is set up for processing. Intercommunication among different clusters is administered through middleware besides slave intra-communication is handled by verification and identification protection. The proposed approach incorporates resistive flow to handle high impact systems that identifies and verifies multiple processes. Statistical analysis determines that the new scheme reduces the overheads from different master and slave servers as they are co-located in clusters which allow increased horizontal and vertical scalability of resources.
