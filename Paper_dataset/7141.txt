AB In the recent past, great attention has been directed toward road surface condition monitoring. As a matter of fact, this activity is of critical importance in transportation infrastructure management. In response, multiple solutions have been proposed which make use of mobile sensing, more specifically contemporary applications and architectures that are used in both crowdsensing and vehicle-based sensing. This has allowed for automated control as well as analysis of road surface quality. These innovations have thus encouraged and showed the importance of cloud to provide reliable transport services to clients. Nonetheless, these initiatives have not been without challenges that range from mobility support, locational awareness, low latency, as well as geo-distribution. As a result, a new term has been coined for this novel paradigm, called, fog computing. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving protocol for enhancing security in vehicular crowdsensing-based road surface condition monitoring system using fog computing. At the onset, this paper proposes a certificateless aggregate signcryption scheme that is highly efficient. On the basis of the proposed scheme, a data transmission protocol for monitoring road surface conditions is designed with security aspects such as information confidentiality, mutual authenticity, integrity, privacy, as well as anonymity. In analyzing the system, the ability of the proposed protocol to achieve the set objectives and exercise higher efficiency with respect to computational and communication abilities in comparison to existing systems is also considered.
