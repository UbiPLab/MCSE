AB This paper proposes a new scheme in cloud service applied to smart home systems based on the technology of the Internet of Things (IoT), and the key technologies include sensing technology and cloud computing ability. The IoT refers to the network of objects, devices, machines, and other physical systems with computing and communication capabilities. On the smart home paradigm, the data collected from sensors can be sensitive information and that security breaches can have devastating economic and social impact. This paper proposes a platform to prevent collusion between users and the cloud service provider (CSP). To protect the privacy of the checked data, the leakage of personnel information in the protocol for the proof must be considered. The proposed protocol can verify users who modify shared files, so that a cloud-storage practice is considered safe. In addition, the proposed method preserves data privacy and minimizes computational cost by applying the bilinearity property of bilinear pairings.
