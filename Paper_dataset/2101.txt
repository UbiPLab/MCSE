AB Cloud Computing is becoming a popular paradigm that has emerged to deliver IT services to consumers as a utility service over the Internet in recent years. The adoption rate of cloud computing is still in the beginning stage in some developing countries. One of the most important services that cloud computing offers is called, 'cloud storage'. Cloud storage is associated with many challenges because customers are still skeptical about trusting it wholeheartedly. There are many aspects related to user's concerns to adopt cloud storage. Data governance is a helpful solution to manage these concerns and make users trust cloud storage. Therefore, the main research contribution of this paper is addressing and considering data governance for reducing the risk on data when it is stored in the cloud. Also, this paper will present the data governance trends in light in new emerging technologies defined by different cloud models, including mobile cloud computing, cloudlet, edge computing and IOT-Cloud Converged architectures. Software defined solutions, more specifically, that for Storage, is also discussed in the context of this paper to potentially be a crosscutting solution for future developments of cloud storage in its different models, though underpinned by a predefined data governance strategy.
