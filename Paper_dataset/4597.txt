AB The dynamic searchable encryption schemes generate search tokens for the encrypted data on a cloud server periodically or on a demand. With such search tokens, a user can query the encrypted data whiles preserving the data's privacy; ie, the cloud server can retrieve the query results to the user but do not know the content of the encrypted data. A framework DSSE with Forward Privacy (dynamic symmetric searchable encryption [DSSE] with forward privacy), which consists of Internet of Things and Cloud storage, with the attributes of the searchable encryption and the privacy preserving are proposed. Compared with the known DSSE schemes, our approach supports the multiusers query. Furthermore, our approach successfully patched most of the security flaws related to the sensitive information's leakage in the DSSE schemes. Both security analysis and simulations show that our approach outperforms other DSSE schemes with respect to both effectiveness and efficiency.
