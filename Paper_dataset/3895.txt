AB Under the combination of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology and traditional industry, the Industrial IoT (IIoT) came into being and received wide attention from all walks of life. With the increase of the number of IIOT devices in industrial environments, security threats, and quality of service (QoS) issues increase drastically. Internal attack is one type of important security threat that makes service environment worse and less reliable. However, there is no unified and fine-grained trust evaluation mechanism to deal with the threats of internal attack and improve QoS of IIoT. To this end, a unified trustworthy environment based on edge computing is established and maintained, which can timely detect malicious service providers and service consumers, filter unreal information, and recommend credible service providers. Edge computing is introduced as an effective service access point, since it supports collecting service records to perform trust evaluations. Moreover, a service selection method is designed to choose the corresponding trustworthy and reliable service providers based on the trust evaluation and the recording criterion, which has distinctive advantages in the succinct trust management, convenient searching service, and accurate service matching. Experiments validated the feasibility of the proposed trustworthy environment.
