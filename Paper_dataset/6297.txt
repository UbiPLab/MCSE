AB The first obstacle to the realization of research on cloud computing is the development of an appropriate research platform. Although commercial clouds are realistic as platforms of research, they are not always practical due to the financial cost and time required by experiments. Also, it is difficult to achieve the evaluation of some critical scenarios and failure. In addition, the experiments are not repeatable, because there are several variables that are not under control of the tester which may affect results. Therefore, it is indispensable to use cloud simulators in order to model and evaluate the performance of cloud applications. This work presents a detailed taxonomy which focuses on the different features of cloud simulators. Then, it provides a comprehensive review of the existing simulation tools available to researchers and industry engineers. Also, a comparative study of these tools is presented. Finally, a discussion of the open research challenges concludes the paper.
