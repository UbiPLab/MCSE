AB Unmanaged resource contention in cloud computing environments can cause problems such as performance interference, service quality degradation, and consequently service agreements violation. Performance isolation is an indispensable remedy solution for the mentioned challenges. Dynamic analysis and monolithic management of the performance isolation from the perspective of cloud computing services with different operating entities is a challenging problem. This issue has not been addressed in previous studies, despite its significance. Most previous researches have focused on particular algorithms and methods for specific application scenarios, and lack sufficient descriptions about analysis and management aspects of the performance isolation. Due to the importance of this issue, this paper aims to make an in-depth investigation of this problem and propose a novel approach in order to dynamic analysis and management of the performance isolation for cloud computing services. Proposed approach employs a novel architectural framework, named DPIM, which enables service providers to realize different isolation methods and enforces performance isolation transparently. The experimental results demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed approach and related framework for performance isolation management in different service environments, with different operating entities.
