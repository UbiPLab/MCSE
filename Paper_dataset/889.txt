AB Physically distributed voters can vote online through an electronic voting (e-voting) system. It can outsource the counting work to the cloud when the system is overloaded. However, this kind of outsourcing may lead to some security problems such as anonymity, privacy and fairness, etc. Suppose servers in the cloud have no incentives to deviate from the e-voting system, these security problems can be effectively solved. In this paper, we assume that servers in cloud are rational, and try to maximise their utilities. We look for incentives for rational servers not to deviate from the e-voting system. Here no deviation means rational servers prefer to cooperate in the e-voting system. Simulation results of our evolution model show that the cooperation level is high after certain rounds. Finally, we put forward a rational e-voting protocol based on the above results and prove that the system is secure under proper assumptions.
