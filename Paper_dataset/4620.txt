AB In this paper, we describe the data security term as more important on the cloud, for the efficiently access control mechanism of information to preserve it. The data accessing mechanism are a very important method present in the cloud storage, so the data outsourcing is authorized on the cloud server for verification of information or various unauthorized users. Basically, cloud computing is utilized in request processing of data and access that request for preserving information. Cloud is used for putting away information it may be shared by various users. All time it is not possible to access all information and verify reliability, so is proposed to contain TPA to confirm the correctness of shared facts of that system. Data Security is done authentication of that the TPA could not obtain client's knowledge from the information captured along with the verification of inspecting process. However, for the security reviewing process of that shared information, to preserve the identification of user remaining part is the open challenge. This paper proposes the system for security preserving so as to permit reviewing the information of clients for common information access in cloud storage. These systems focus on the verification of information is necessary for auditing to check the correctness of common information. The reliability of this mutual information of the TPA can verify secretly without retrieving whole information. The Final output achieved through this experiment proves the capacity of this executed system while reviewing shared information
