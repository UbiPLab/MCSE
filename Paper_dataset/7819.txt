AB This work uses the open source codes and PHP web programming to implement a resource management system with power saving method for virtual machines. We propose a system integrated with open source software, such as KVM and Libvirt, to construct a virtual cloud management platform. This system can detect the status of cloud resources via SNMP, calculate the operation efficiency of the overall system, allocate virtual machines through the live migration technology, and turn off extra machines in the cloud to save energy. According to our proposed power saving method, we have constructed a power efficient virtualization management platform in the cloud. Our objective is to provide enterprises or end users with power saving private cloud solutions. In this work we have also built a web page to allow users to easily access and control the cloud virtualization resources, i.e., users can manage virtual machines and monitor the status of resources via the web interface. From analysis of the experimental results of live migration of virtual machines, this work demonstrates that efficient use of hardware resources is realized by the power saving method, and the aim of power saving for cloud computing is achieved.
