AB On-demand resource provisioning makes cloud computing a cutting edge technology. All cloud service providers offer computing resources with their own interface type, instance type, and pricing policy, among other service features. A cloud-based service broker provides intermediation to seek appropriate service providers in terms a suitable trade-off between price and performance. On the other hand, load balancing among cloud resources ensures efficient use of a physical infrastructure, and at the same time, minimizes execution time. This makes service brokers and load balancing among the most important issues in cloud computing systems. This paper aims to propose three different cloud brokering algorithms, and a load balancing algorithm. A simulation-based deployment confirms that our proposed algorithms minimized the cost, and at the same time, witnessed gains in service performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
