AB Public auditing is a new technique to protect the integrity of outsourced data in the remote cloud. Users delegate the ability of auditing to a third party auditor (TPA), and assume that each result from the TPA is correct. However, the TPA is not always trustworthy in reality. In this paper, we consider a scenario in which the TPA may lower the reputation of the cloud server by cheating users, and propose a novel public auditing scheme to address this security issue. The analyses and the evaluation prove that our scheme is both secure and efficient.
