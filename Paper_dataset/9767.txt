AB Cloud computing is a new IT trend with several economic benefits and many applications are migrating to the cloud environment. However, there are concerns on its adoption for critical data infrastructure caused by security issues and privacy data. Survey results show the most sensitive items of IT managers for cloud platform adoption are cost efficiency and data security. To review the benefits and challenges of cloud environment adoption in critical infrastructure, we identify new energy system of smart grid as an example. Also, we compare the well-defined security requirements of smart grid system with current cloud computing status to check if smart grid system can use cloud computing environment from the security perspective. In addition to functional review, we anticipate the changes of security investment efficiency after cloud environment adoption.
