AB This work proposes BigCache, a cache-based BigData management in mobile networks. Today's handy world produces torrent of data, which should be processed in time, so that data are transformed in useful information. Moreover, the mobile world adds the exponential growth of information in the form of BigData such as image, audio or video. This BigData is frequently and repeatedly downloaded across the world on various devices, where a mobile device became a first choice. Hence, we focus on how effectively a BigData can be delivered to the end user using cache-based approach in mobile networks. The main contributions of our work are threefold. First, we present an architecture of BigCache along with the cache decision system and cache replacement process for rapid access to BigData at large extent in mobile networks. Second, we propose three different caching schemes, designated as request-based caching scheme, priority-based caching scheme and scale-based caching scheme in BigCache. Third, our performance study shows that BigCache highly impacts on low bandwidth usage of an end user, while immense reduction on server-load, thereby improving performance of mobile networks and internet traffic.
