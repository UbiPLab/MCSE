AB With the explosion of connected devices, the Internet-of-Things (loT) is expected to be the fundamental infrastructure of the information society and receives a wide variety of applications in different scenarios. However, the fast-growing loT technology is still facing many challenges posed by large-scale heterogeneous loT devices. To address these challenges we propose a transparent computing based loT architecture to build scalable and manageable loT applications. The proposed architecture consists of five layers, i.e., end-user layer, edge network layer, core network layer, service&storage layer, and management layer. It can provide centralized management of various resources like operating systems, services and data for loT applications, and enable on-demand services to be executed on heterogeneous loT devices. We also build a prototype system to evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture in terms of the delay and energy consumption in remote service updating. The experimental results demonstrate that it can provide efficient management of various resources and achieve on-demand service provisioning for loT devices. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.
