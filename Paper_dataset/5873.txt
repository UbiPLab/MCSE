AB Cloud computing frameworks were proposed to collect the Quality of Experience (QoE) of users and deliver the Quality of Service (QoS) according to needs as declared in Service Level Agreement (SLA). This paper presents review followed by analysis of famous QoE frameworks for cloud computing based on the certain features such as deployment parameters, network and client monitoring, QoE data analysis, reporting tools and dynamic policy change. During the study of QoE frameworks it has been learned that all the frameworks have limited scope. None of them supports qualitative data analysis, policy change. The frameworks also lack in monitoring of the user device for resources and services that are received at the client side. The QoE review submitted by the users is essential and needs an appropriate place within the framework for cloud computing.
