DE Shared data; virtual TPM pool; lightweight calculation; agent security
AB A cloud platform provides users with shared data storage services. To ensure shared data integrity, it is necessary to validate the data effectively. An audit scheme that enables group members to modify data conducts the integrity verification of the shared data, but this approach results in complex calculations for the group members. The audit scheme of the designated agent implements a lightweight calculation for the group members, but it ignores the security risks between the group members and the agents. By introducing Hashgraph technology and designing a Third Party Medium (TPM) management strategy, a lightweight secure auditing scheme for shared data in cloud storage (LSSA) is proposed, which achieves security management of the groups and a lightweight calculation for the group members. Meanwhile, a virtual TPM pool is constructed by combining the TCP sliding window technology and interconnected functions to improve agent security. We evaluate our scheme in numerical analysis and in experiments, the results of which demonstrate that our scheme achieves lightweight computing for the group members and ensures the data verification process for security.
