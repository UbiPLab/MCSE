AB Vehicular fog computing, which extends the mobile cloud paradigm, is usually composed of stable infrastructures, a large volume of vehicles, portable devices, and robust networks. As a service-providing platform, it is significant to quickly obtain the required service with the aim to correctly save the energy of the corresponding nodes and effectively improve the network survivability. However, the limited capacity of components makes such a situation more complicated. This paper aims to reduce serving time by allocating the available bandwidth to four kinds of services. A utility model is built according to the above-mentioned serving methods and is solved through a two-step approach. For the first step, all the sub-optimal solutions are provided based on a Lagrangian algorithm. For the second step, an optimal solution selection process is presented and analyzed. A numerical simulation is executed to illustrate the allocation results and the optimal utility model while optimizing the survivability.
