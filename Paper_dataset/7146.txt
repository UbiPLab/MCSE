AB WSN-integrated cloud computing (WCC) has become a promising cloud service architecture, in which sensors and mobile devices are utilized as the data collecting and processing nodes for the cloud service model, while cloud servers can provide computing services and storage services with high performance and reliability. However, since cloud servers are not fully trusted, and sensors and mobile devices have very limited computing capability and storage capacity, WCC brings forth new challenges for data confidentiality, data integrity and access control when sensors store important data for sharing in the WCC environment. Moreover, there are still no proper solutions for fine-grained, efficient and secure data access control in WCC. To solve this issue, we propose a fine-grained and lightweight data access control scheme for WCC, namely FLAC, which includes a ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption algorithm for data confidentiality and fine-grained data access control, and an attribute-based signature algorithm for data integrity and the many-read-many-write case of data access. By delegating most computation intensive tasks to cloud services, FLAC enables resource constrained sensors and mobile devices to perform security operations rapidly. The security assessment and performance evaluation demonstrate that FLAC is secure, highly efficient and well suited for WSN applications.
