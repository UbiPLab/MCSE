AB Electroholography can produce natural 3D scenes and has gained recognition as an ideal 3D technology. However, insufficient computational power has made it difficult to achieve real-time electroholography. In this paper, we developed a compact special-purpose system for calculating phase-only holograms. We implemented the developed system using a system on a chip embedded with a processor and logic circuit blocks. Our system successfully computed holograms of 1,920x1,080 pixels from a point-cloud with 32,500 points at 10 frames per second. The system is 147 times faster than a personal computer (with 6 CPU cores). (C) 2020 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement
