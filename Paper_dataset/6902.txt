AB Predicting query response time is a fundamental issue for many database system management tasks, such as query scheduling, query progress visualization, system sizing, and load balancing. Query interaction, an interesting phenomenon that query response time might be accelerated or deaccelerated by concurrent queries, has to be taken into account when building models for predicting query response time. Since query interactions change over time and are hard to describe with analytical models, therefore, statistical models are proposed to achieve better performance by describing query interactions in terms of statistics of query mixes, consisting of a set of concurrently running queries. The high multi-programming level (MPL) of modern data centers means an explosive space of query mixes, which results in a high cost for training statistical models, especially in the pay-as-you-go cloud computing settings. To address this issue, we propose a clustering-based sampling method to reduce sampling cost while maintaining the accuracy of statistical models. High quality samples are selected to cover all the clusters with representativeness in terms of query interactions. Query rating is introduced as the feature vector of queries, and transformed to the feature vector of query mixes for clustering purpose. Experimental evaluation with TPC-H queries shows that the proposed method can reduce 33% sampling cost while maintaining the accuracy of the statistical models.
