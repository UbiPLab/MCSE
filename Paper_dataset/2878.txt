AB Cloud computing is one of the most advanced technologies to present computerized generation. Scheduling plays a major role in it. The connectivity of Virtual Machines (VM) to schedule the assigned tasks (cloudlet) is a most attractive field to research. This paper introduces a confined Cloudlet Migration based scheduling algorithm using Enhanced-First Come First Serve (CM-eFCFS). The objective of this work is to minimize the makespan, cost and to optimize the resource utilization. The proposed work has been simulated in the CloudSim toolkit package. The results have been compared with pre-existing scheduling algorithms with same experimental configuration. Important parameters like execution time, completion time, cost, makespan and utilization of resources are compared to measure the performance of the proposed algorithm. Extensive simulation results prove that introduced work has better results than existing approaches. 99.8% resource utilization has been achieved by CM-eFCFS. Plotted graphs and calculated values show that the proposed algorithm is very effective for cloudlet scheduling.
