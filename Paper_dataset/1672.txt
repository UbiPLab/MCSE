ID TRUSTWORTHINESS; FRAMEWORK
AB Cloud services are cloud computing resources and applications deployed on the Internet or cloud computing platform, and users can access the required cloud services at any time. However, users face the diversity and complexity of quality of service (QoS) when evaluating and selecting cloud services. Therefore, it is important to study and establish an effective and objective trust model to improve user satisfaction and interaction success rate. In this paper, a model based on combining weights and gray correlation analysis is proposed. Firstly, direct trust, recommendation trust, and reputation together form a comprehensive trust, resulting in a more accurate overall trust. Second, rough set theory and analytic hierarchy process (AHP)-based method are used for the direct trust. Meanwhile, the degree of similarity recommendation trust is calculated by a gray relational analysis method. In order to ensure the accuracy of direct trust, this paper proposes a dynamic trust update mechanism. Finally, the simulation experiment is carried out to verify that the cloud services trust evaluation model (CSTEM) is more robust than the other three methods. It protects against malicious entities; at the same time, it can increase user satisfaction and interaction success rate.
