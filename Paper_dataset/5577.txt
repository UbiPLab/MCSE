AB For the cloud computing based on software-defined networks (SDNs), a larger amount of data is collected to cloud for analysis, which will cause the larger amount of redundancy data and longer service response time due to the capacity-limited Internet. To solve this problem, a novel service orchestration and data aggregation framework (SODA) is proposed, which can orchestrate data as services and aggregate data packets to reduce data redundancy and service response delay. In SODA, the network is divided into three layers. 1) Data centers layer (DCL). Data centers (DCs) release software with a specific function to all devices in the network, devices orchestrate data as services and aggregate data packets using software to reduce service response delay. 2) Middle routing layer (MRL). The routing path of data packets in this layer is adjusted according to the correlation of data packets and routing distance. The correlation of data packets is higher and routing distance is short, the probability that data packets are transmitted along the same routing path is higher to reduce redundancy data. 3) Vehicle network layer (VNL). Mobile vehicles are used to transmit data packets and services among devices. A series of experiments and simulation is conducted. The results illustrate that the proposed scheme has better performance compared with the traditional scheme.
