AB College English has always been a basic course in colleges and universities. However, college English teaching in China still adopts the traditional cramming teaching mode, which cannot improve students' English ability quickly. In view of this problem, this paper puts forward an innovative teaching mode based on big data technology, and takes professional college English teaching as a supplement to ordinary college English teaching. Based on big data and cloud computing technology, this innovative teaching model constructs an all-round English teaching cloud system including database, laboratory and after-class online teaching resources. The results show that the innovative teaching model of college English big data cloud system can effectively promote the development of teaching and improve students' English ability by making use of various resources in the age of big data.
