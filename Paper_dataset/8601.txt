AB Many factors affect the time cost of Cloud computing tasks. One of the most serious factors is data transmission latency, which reduces the efficiency of Cloud computing. Many notable schemes that have been proposed to overcome this factor ignore the communication cost among virtual machines (VMs) in the MapReduce environment. In this paper, we propose a VM placement approach to reduce data transmission latency by focusing on the communication cost among VMs. In this approach, we first propose two VM placement optimization algorithms to minimize the total data transmission latency and the maximum data transmission latency in the MapReduce environment. Then, we use the algorithms to place VMs for Map and Reduce phase. Finally, we analyze the time complexity for our approach. We implement our approach by simulation. The simulation results show that our approach reduces the average data transmission latency by 26.3% compared with other approaches.
