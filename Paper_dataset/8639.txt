AB Using the eccentric of truncated preservation, cloud computing gives a reasonable and proficient result for distributing cluster resources among cloud clients. Regrettably, distributing data in a multi user fashion whereas maintaining data and individuality privacy from an unfaith cloud is quiet a puzzling concern, because of the recurrent change of the participation. The proposed system focuses a protected multi user data distributing method, for active clusters in the cloud. Using group signature and active broadcast encryption methods, any cloud client can secretly distribute data among others. Provisionally, the storage load and encryption calculation cost of the proposed method is liberated from the amount of repealed clients. Additionally, the security and performance analysis of the proposed method shows that, much more efficient and secure than all other existing methods.
