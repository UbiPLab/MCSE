AB Edge computing extends the capabilities of computation, network connection, and storage from the cloud to the edge of the network. It enables the application of business logic between the downstream data of the cloud service and the upstream data of the Internet of Things (IoT). In the field of Industrial IoT, edge computing provides added benefits of agility, real-time processing, and autonomy to create value for intelligent manufacturing. With the focus on the concept of edge computing, this article proposes an architecture of edge computing for IoT-based manufacturing. It also analyzes the role of edge computing from four aspects including edge equipment, network communication, information fusion, and cooperative mechanism with cloud computing. Finally, we give a case study to implement the active maintenance based on a prototype platform. This article aims to provide a technical reference for the deployment of edge computing in the smart factory.
