AB In utility computing, customer requests varying services from software to infrastructure as and when needed. As a result, there are many mobile cloud providers provide this services on demand basis as per current market needs. To ensure compliance and security, these providers establish a contract popularly known as Service Level Agreement (SLA) which states the services and management aspects. Such SLA is usually managed by third party entities and in some case by intelligent autonomic agents. But owing to the growing needs and demands of customers, dynamic SLA was offered by the service providers. A dynamic SLA is a redefined SLA whenever new services are demanded by the customer after SLA negotiation. Consequently these dynamic SLA need tamper protection from unauthorized users to prevent unnecessary changes which may lead to SLA violation consequently losing the trust of customers. This paper proposes a data integrity protection for the dynamic SLA using visual cryptography and semi-homomorphic encryption in intelligent agent based service level architecture. As a result the autonomous intelligent agents, customers and service providers can modify the SLA without decrypting the encrypted SLA and Sitekey authentication thereby achieving tamper protection. Furthermore this also ensures the multiparty involvement in dynamic SLA management in intelligent agent based service level architecture.
