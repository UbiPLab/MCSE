AB Data center power consumption is among the largest commodity expenditures for many organizations. Reduction of power used in cloud data centres with heterogeneous physical resources can be achieved through Virtual-Machine (VM) consolidation which reduces the number of Physical Machines (PMs) used, subject to Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. This paper provides an in-depth survey of the most recent techniques and algorithms used in proactive dynamic VM consolidation focused on energy consumption. We present a general framework that can be used on multiple phases of a complete consolidation process.
