AB The current society lives in the era of the mobile devices (especially smarthphones). These devices are used to execute various tasks: send mail, access internet bank, payments and so on. However, mobile device faces with an issue of availability because the battery autonomy is limited. To extend the battery autonomy, one emerging solution is to use the cloud and offload tasks to save energy. One existing issue in this context is related to the decision of which applications are better candidates to this approach, and this issue can be mitigated by the use of performance evaluation techniques. However there is a lack in the literature about how to carry performance evaluation activities in the context of mobile cloud computing. Based on that, this work presents a methodology to realize studies of performance evaluation on mobile cloud computing environments considering measurement approaches. To evaluate the proposed methodology, a case study was developed and the results show how to compare the impact of executing an application in the device in comparison to execute it in the cloud through the use of offload techniques.
