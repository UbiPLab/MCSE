AB In view of the development trend of enterprise information technology, this study proposes a synergic degree measure model between modern information technology and enterprise strategy management. This schedule uses popular technologies, such as cloud computing and service-oriented architecture (SOA), to solve complex enterprise information. It allows for a detailed analysis of the information technology strategic management of an enterprise, and analysis results can be used extensively in enterprise management. In summary, cloud computing accelerates the processing of enterprise information, and SOA clarifies enterprise management problems. Thus, this strategic management model has considerable application values.
