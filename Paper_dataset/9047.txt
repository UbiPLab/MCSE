AB A new ontology is required to complement the change in business model due to a disruptive technology called cloud computing. The cloud computing technology has the potential to integrate a supply chain and create a better value network. The existing models from previous research are unable to map the benefits of cloud computing from the perspectives of multiple actors and highlight where exactly the benefits occur along the supply chain. The network business model is proposed to facilitate the adoption of the cloud computing technology that maps four key components namely value, activity, actor, and benefit. A case study involving a logistics company and a cloud solution provider was conducted to observe the adaptability and the rigidity of the model. Rather than going head-to-head with the license-based model such as ERP, cloud-based solutions integrate such systems and create an end-to-end visibility across the supply chain, which includes procurement, distribution, and inventory visibilities.
