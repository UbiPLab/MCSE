AB The communication process is very easy today due to the rapid growth of information technology. In addition, the development of cloud computing technology makes it easier than earlier days by facilitating the large volume of data exchange anytime and from anywhere in the world. E-businesses are successfully running today due to the development of cloud computing technology. Specifically in cloud computing, cloud services are providing enormous support to share the resources and data in an efficient way with less cost expenses for businessmen. However, security is an essential issue for cloud users and services. For this purpose, many security policies have been introduced by various researchers for enhancing the security in e-commerce applications. However, the available security policies are also failing to provide the secured services in the society and e-commerce applications. To overcome this disadvantage, we propose a new policy-oriented secured service model for providing the security of the services in the cloud. The proposed model is the combination of a trust aware policy scheduling algorithm and an effective and intelligent re-encryption scheme. Here, the dynamic trust aware policy-oriented service for allocating the cloud user's request by the cloud service provider and an effective and re-encryption scheme is used that uses intelligent agent for storing the data in the cloud database securely. The proposed model assures the scalability, reliability, and security for the stored e-commerce data and service access.
