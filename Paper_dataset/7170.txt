AB The increasing number of next-generation multimedia services and social media applications in cloud computing put additional challenges in efficient resource provisioning that targets to minimize under or over utilization of resources as well as to increase user satisfaction. Most of the works in the literature focused either on resource estimation and scheduling approaches or energy consumption for executing social media data processing applications. However, they do not consider energy consumption cost for communication devices and network appliances and schedule Virtual Machines (VMs) based on centralized job placement approach. In this paper, we develop a Quality of Service (QoS) aware cloud resource management system that decreases energy consumption and increases resource utilization by diverse multimedia social applications. In order to minimize the VM creation time we allow recycling of VM resources for user request with similar resource requirements. We have developed two distributed and localized resource management algorithms based on energy conservation, and requirements and availability of resources. The results of simulation experiments depict that the resource scheduling system greatly reduces the amount of energy consumption while maintaining the QoS of social multimedia applications.
