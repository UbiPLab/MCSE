AB As cloud computing becomes prevalent, many data owners outsource their large number of graph data into the cloud for cost savings. The cloud may not be fully trusted and usually likes to learn owners' data. To protect the security of graph data, sensitive data have to be stored in an encrypted form. Neighbor queries are the most essential operations, many other operations can be built based on the neighbor queries. Ranked neighbor queries can make the queries very flexible, a query user can get ranked search results. When the graph data are encrypted, the operations over graph data are very inconvenient. Ranked neighbor queries over encrypted graph data are difficult to directly achieve. In this paper, we propose a solution to perform privacy-preserving ranked neighbor query over encrypted graph data in the cloud, which is named as PRNQ. Our work utilizes ranking function and encryption mechanism to perform ranked neighbor query. The query users can obtain the most wanted search results by this solution. Our paper proposes a design scheme for the weighted directed graph and proves the security and correctness. Experimental results with a real graph data set demonstrate the validity and efficiency of our scheme. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
