AB Data centers are becoming the main backbone of and centralized repository for all cloud-accessible services in on-demand cloud computing environments. In particular, virtual data centers (VDCs) facilitate the virtualization of all data center resources such as computing, memory, storage, and networking equipment as a single unit. It is necessary to use the data center efficiently to improve its profitability. The essential factor that significantly influences efficiency is the average number of VDC requests serviced by the infrastructure provider, and the optimal allocation of requests improves the acceptance rate. In existing VDC request embedding algorithms, data center performance factors such as resource utilization rate and energy consumption are not taken into consideration. This motivated us to design a strategy for improving the resource utilization rate without increasing the energy consumption. We propose novel VDC embedding methods based on row-epitaxial and batched greedy algorithms inspired by bioinformatics. These algorithms embed new requests into the VDC while reembedding previously allocated requests. Reembedding is done to consolidate the available resources in the VDC resource pool. The experimental testbed results show that our algorithms boost the data center objectives of high resource utilization (by improving the request acceptance rate), low energy consumption, and short VDC request scheduling delay, leading to an appreciable return on investment.
