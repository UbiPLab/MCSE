AB Cooperative offloading in mobile edge computing enables resource-constrained edge clouds to help each other with computation-intensive tasks. However, the power of such offloading could not be fully unleashed, unless trust risks in collaboration are properly managed. As tasks are outsourced and processed at the network edge, completion latency usually presents high variability that can harm the offered service levels. By jointly considering these two challenges, we propose OLCD, an Online Learning-aided Cooperative offloaDing mechanism under the scenario where computation offloading is organized based on accumulated social trust. Under co-provisioning of computation, transmission, and trust services, trust propagation is performed along the multi-hop offloading path such that tasks are allowed to be fulfilled by powerful edge clouds. We harness Lyapunov optimization to exploit the spatial-temporal optimality of long-term system cost minimization problem. By gap-preserving transformation, we decouple the series of bidirectional offloading problems so that it suffices to solve a separate decision problem for each edge cloud. The optimal offloading control can not materialize without complete latency knowledge. To adapt to latency variability, we resort to the delayed online learning technique to facilitate completion latency prediction under long-duration processing, which is fed as input to queued-based offloading control policy. Such predictive control is specially designed to minimize the loss due to prediction errors over time. We theoretically prove that OLCD guarantees close-to-optimal system performance even with inaccurate prediction, but its robustness is achieved at the expense of decreased stability. Trace-driven simulations demonstrate the efficiency of OLCD as well as its superiorities over prior related work.
