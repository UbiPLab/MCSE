AB The heart disease is one of the most serious health problems in today's world. Over 50 million persons have cardiovascular diseases around the world. Our proposed work based on 744 segments of ECG signal is obtained from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database (strongly imbalanced data) for one lead (modified lead II), from 29 people. In this work, we have used long-duration (10 s) ECG signal segments (13 times less classifications/analysis). The spectral power density was estimated based on Welch's method and discrete Fourier transform to strengthen the characteristic ECG signal features. Our main contribution is the design of a novel three-layer (48 + 4 + 1) deep genetic ensemble of classifiers (DGEC). Developed method is a hybrid which combines the advantages of: (1) ensemble learning, (2) deep learning, and (3) evolutionary computation. Novel system was developed by the fusion of three normalization types, four Hamming window widths, four classifiers types, stratified tenfold cross-validation, genetic feature (frequency components) selection, layered learning, genetic optimization of classifiers parameters, and new genetic layered training (expert votes selection) to connect classifiers. The developed DGEC system achieved a recognition sensitivity of 94.62% (40 errors/744 classifications), accuracy = 99.37%, specificity = 99.66% with classification time of single sample = 0.8736 (s) in detecting 17 arrhythmia ECG classes. The proposed model can be applied in cloud computing or implemented in mobile devices to evaluate the cardiac health immediately with highest precision.
