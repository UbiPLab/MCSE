AB The data management across the different domains is the foremost requirement for many organizations universally. The organization establishes the cloud computing paradigm to handle the data effectively due to its robust scaling at a low cost. In recent times the usage of cloud and its data is increasing with the multiuser environments. This resulted in the issue of ensuring the security of data in the cloud environment uploaded by the owners. The cloud service providers and researchers implemented several schemes to ensure data security. However, the task of providing security with multiuser remains tedious with data leakage. A novel Enigmatic Diagonal Encryption Standard (EDES) algorithm to provide access control over the cloud is proposed. The framework with the proposed algorithm is named as EDES-ACM. The Inverse Decisional Diffie Hellman (IDDH) technique is used for generating the signature of the group. The data is encrypted with the EDES algorithm by the data owner. The encrypted data is provided to the user and is accessed by the EDES based private key. The group manager monitors the cloud and provides the activity report to owners based on which the revocation is performed. The framework is validated for its performance on security parameters and compared with the existing models on computation cost. The EDES-ACM framework is effective with low computation cost. The future notion for the proposed framework is to include the block chain technology that may improve the security and better accumulation of data.
