   Packaging strategy
AB I/O intensive application is one of the most popular cloud applications. However, few studies have focused on how to improve the processing efficiency of this specific type of application. Based on the previous studies on this kind of application, a package-based strategy is put forward. With this strategy, the files less than some threshold are packaged before the specific I/O operations. This can remarkably shorten the addressing and transmission time of these files and much improve the efficiency of I/O resources. To verify the strategy, we have done extensive experiments. The experimental results show the packaging strategy can efficiently improve the processing efficiency of I/O-intensive applications in cloud computing. This is beneficial for increasing the resource efficiency of cloud data centers.
