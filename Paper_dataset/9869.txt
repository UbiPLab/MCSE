AB Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) can have high demands for real-time data transmission and processing, but this is often constrained by limited resources. Cloud Computing can act as the backend for WSNs to provide processing and storage on demand. Sensor-Cloud infrastructure is becoming popular that can provide an open, flexible, and reconfigurable platform for several monitoring and controlling applications. Most common technique for knowing the location of vehicle is with the help of GPS. In the proposed system introducing the concept of determining the traffic Congestion in way of travelling using pre condition monitoring with sensor nodes.
