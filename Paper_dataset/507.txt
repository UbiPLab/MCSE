AB Assuring the security of the communication channel is a significant issue in the fog networks. Designing an efficient and secure key management scheme with a common key among nodes is a critical factor. The available key distribution schemes of hierarchical networks are not scalable and impose high communication and computation overhead to networks. These schemes are impractical on limited resources' environments like the internet of things (IoT) networks. In this paper, a hierarchical key pre-distribution scheme based on the transversal design and residual theorem (TD-R) is proposed for large mobile fog networks with multi-clouds. The objective of this paper to reveal that TD-R is the key pre-distribution scheme for establishing secure intra and inter-fog nodes' communication channels and intra and inter-end nodes with moderate network connectivity. The obtained results indicate that the TD-R scheme increases network scalability in comparison with available schemes, while it decreases memory consumption and node storage overhead.
