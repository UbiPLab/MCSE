AB With the popularity of cloud computing services, outsourcing computation has entered a period of rapid development. Modular exponentiation is one of the most expensive operations in public key cryptographic systems, but the current outsourcing algorithms for modular exponentiations (MExps) with single server are inefficient or have small checkability. In this paper, we propose an efficient and fully verifiable algorithm for outsourcing multiple MExps with single untrusted server where the errors can be detected by an outsourcer with a probability of 1. The theory analysis and experimental evaluations also showthat the proposed algorithm is the most efficient one compared with the previous work. Finally, we present the outsourcing schemes of digital signature algorithm (DSA) and attribute based encryption (ABE) as two applications of the proposed algorithm.
