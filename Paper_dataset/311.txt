AB With the spread of smart cities through 5G and the development of IoT devices, the number of services requiring firm assurance of high capacity and ultra-low delay quality in various forms is increasing. However, continuous growth of large data makes it difficult for a centralized cloud to ensure quality of service. For this, a variety of distributed application architecture researches, such as MEC (Mobile vertical bar Mutli-access Edge Computing), are in progress. However, vendor-dependent MEC technology based on VNF (Virtual Network Function) has performance and scalability issues when deploying a variety of 5G-based services. This paper proposes PRISM-MECR, an SDN (Software Defined Network) based hardware accelerated MEC router using P4 [3] programmable chip, to improve forwarding performance while minimizing load of host CPU cores in charge of forwarding among MEC technologies.
