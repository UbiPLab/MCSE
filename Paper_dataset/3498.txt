AB Connected vehicular cloud computing (CVCC) and the VANET can realize real-time monitoring and intelligent adjustment of traffic conditions. With the data collected by vehicles and the guidance provided by cloud computing platforms, the current traffic is facing new opportunities. CVCC is a mobile computing model, which extends the fixed nodes of traditional cloud infrastructure into mobile nodes composed of vehicles. Thus, compared to the traditional cloud infrastructures, CVCC requires a more complex mechanism to ensure the secure and efficient information transmission in both cloud platform-to-vehicle communication and vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Channel capacity, as the key parameter to measure the channel utilization, plays an important role in ensuring the reliability of CVCC service and the integrity of transmission data. In recent decades, the existing calculation methods could not solve the channel capacities problem in multi-participant VANETs. Different from the traditional calculation methods, we propose a novel calculation method in this article, which combines the core concepts of game theory and information theory, to calculate the channel capacities of multiple vehicular networks. The proposed method refreshes the concept of communication, which has potential applications in different services of CVCC.
