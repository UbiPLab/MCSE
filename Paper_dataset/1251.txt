AB Two important problems concerning software engineering are identified: low efficiency of the software development process, and lack of programmers. Three key components with considerable impact on the software development process, namely the software engineering method, the problem specification language, and the platform used, are identified. Four state of the art reviews are prepared including software engineering methods, problem specification languages, cloud computing platforms, and related works. This research problem is solved by the realization of the Knowledge Based Automated Software Engineering (KBASE) method for generation of enterprise information systems, based on 5GL specification languages, common platform for automated programming and a set of intelligent components for generation of new applications from well-defined system and business reusable components in three groups - domain independent, domain dependent and problem solving. KBASE concept, KBASE technological process, KBASE specification language, and KBASE platform are described. Key results achieved in the related works are detailed. The efficiency of the new computational paradigm is presented.
