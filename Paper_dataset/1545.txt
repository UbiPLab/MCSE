AB The main focus of this paper is to describe the structure of the cyber-physical machining system developed for on-line surface roughness monitoring via cutting chip size control in end-milling The two level cyber- physical machining system is realized by connecting the computing resources in the developed cloud machining platform to the machine tool with its smart sensor system. The smart optical sensor system is developed to acquire and transfer in real time the values of the cutting chips sizes to the cloud level. The cloud based machining platform with the developed internet of things applications is employed to perform instant surface roughness monitoring and cutting chip size control based on advanced sensor signal processing edge computing process feature extraction, machine learning process modeling data analyzing and cognitive corrective process control acting These actions are performed as cloud services. A cloud application with an adaptive neural inference system is applied to model and on-line predict surface roughness based on the determined cutting chip size. Based on the in-process predictions, a novel application for cognitive corrective control acting is employed to control the cutting chip size by modifying the machining parameters and consequently keeping surface roughness constant The results of the machining experiment are presented to demonstrate that this proposed system where the cloud computing resources and services are linked with the machine tool is feasible and could be implemented to monitor surface roughness during milling operation.
