AB In view of the current increasing development of medical cloud platform, this paper presents a model based on the integration of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) using the RBF network. We design a security risk prediction model of cloud computing system and use the MRHGA in order to perform the parallel evolutionary Medical Cloud Computing Risk Prediction Method based on AHP and MRHGA optimization of the AHP-RBF model so as to effectively resolve inherent defects of RBF learning algorithm. In particular, we target on: slow convergence rate, difficulty in convergence to globally optimal solution, real-time performance of system risk online assessment, etc. The introduction of AHP allows for different preferences of cloud computing system risk and different indicator systems in which the risk judgment and identification are based. The prior weight matrix of AHP restrains the assessment model fairly and combines the RBF network to realize overall risk prediction of cloud computing system. Finally, test results show that the modeling method used in this paper has a better predictive effect in the test data simulation of Web-service and cloud storage service-oriented cloud computing system.
