AB Cloud computing has in the recent past gained a lot of ground in this digital age. The use of cloud technologies in business has broken barriers in sharing information making the world one big global village. Regardless of where one is, data or information can be received or sent instantly disregarding distance. In this research, we investigated the challenges in registering candidates for school examinations and availability of internet services in various parts of Zambia and then present a candidate registration process based on the cloud model which is aimed at resolving challenges of distances from examination centres to the examining body in order to register for examinations as well as improving the timelines and cutting down the back and forth movements in the whole process. The web based registration system was developed and tested and the testing ascertained connectivity, functionality and scalability of the system.
