AB Intelligent transportation systems have seen a very great increase in research contribution especially with the advent of cloud and internet of things for handling big data. With the increasing need to monitor, manage effectively with available set of resources, a majority of concerns have been on a migration pattern towards cloud networks. The proposed research paper has investigated and framed an intelligent cloud based transportation cluster model for effective and efficient delivery of transportation and management data to the server and client. The case study has been taken up for the city of Macau in China which is observed to have a complicated and sophisticated system of transportation with the ever increasing growth of tourism in the country. Vehicular traffic monitoring and management using a fuzzy C means algorithm for effectively reducing the computational overhead in terms of complexity and time has been proposed, implemented and tested with results validated against recent intelligent transportation models found in the literature.
