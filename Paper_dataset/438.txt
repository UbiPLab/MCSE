AB Due to technological advancement and deployment of handheld devices, mobile computing devices have gained the user attention to save resource usage, service access, and application use. In practice, it can be deployed widely to experience massive data storage and less computation cost. However, wireless channel access is vulnerable and insecure to prevent various potential attacks such as replay, redirection, etc. As a consequence, a seamless secure anonymous authentication scheme (S-SAAS) is proposed to create a secure session in cloud-based mobile edge computing. Since IoT, cloud computing, big-data and mobile technologies are converged to permit the group-based communication systems, it is highly demanded to strengthen the authentication process in order to reduce the security risk and vulnerabilities. Moreover, the experimental analysis proves that the proposed S-SAAS scheme consumes less signaling congestion and routing control overhead to achieve better service connection rate.
