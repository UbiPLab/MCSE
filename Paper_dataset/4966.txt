AB In this era of developing technologies, one of the most promising is cloud computing that has been functioning since years and used by individuals and large enterprises to provide different kind of services to the world. Cloud computing is attractive to business owners as it eliminates the requirement for users to plan ahead for pm-visioning hardware and allows enterprises to start from the small scale and increase resources only when there is a rise in service demand. One of the trends in cloud computing is the use of decentralized cloud, where resources arc shared between multiple servers instead of one central server. The use of decentralized cloud can reduce task complexity and work efficiency per server by utilizing small amount of resources from various servers. With this emerging trend in decentralized cloud, various methodologies were introduced to implement it. One of the most important methodology that plays a vital role in decentralized cloud is Load distribution. Load distribution can be achieved in various ways and hence different approaches can lead to better ways to distribute load in cloud servers. So by researching various methodologies used in cloud computing, a similar but new load distribution algorithm can be implemented which will be based on current statistics of the server nodes by comparing statistics the resultant best node can be chosen to dispatch the file which is to be uploaded.
