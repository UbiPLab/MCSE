AB Monitoring will play an enabling role in the orchestration of next-gen Fog applications. Particularly, monitoring of Fog computing infrastructures should deal with platform heterogeneity, scarce resource availability at the edge, and high dynamicity all along the Cloud-IoT continuum. In this article, we describe FogMon, a C++ distributed monitoring prototype targeting Fog computing infrastructures. FogMon monitors hardware resources at different Fog nodes, end-to-end network QoS between such nodes, and connected IoT devices. Besides, it features a self-organising peer-to-peer topology with self-restructuring mechanisms, and differential monitoring updates, which ensure scalability, fault-tolerance and low communication overhead. Experiments on a real testbed show how the footprint of FogMon is limited and how its self-restructuring topology makes it resilient to infrastructure dynamicity. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.
