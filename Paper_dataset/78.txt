AB The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the educational systems worldwide, leading to the near-total closures of schools, universities, and colleges. Universities need to adapt to changes to face this crisis without negatively affecting students' performance. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to identify and help solve to critical challenges and factors that influence the e-learning system for Computer Maintenance courses during the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper examines the effect of a hybrid modeling approach that uses Cloud Computing Services (CCS) and Virtual Reality (VR) in a Virtual Cloud Learning Environment (VCLE) system. The VCLE system provides students with various utilities and educational services such as presentation slides/text, data sharing, assignments, quizzes/tests, and chatrooms. In addition, learning through VR enables the students to simulate physical presence, and they respond well to VR environments that are closer to reality as they feel that they are an integral part of the environment. Also, the research presents a rubric assessment that the students can use to reflect on the skills they used during the course. The research findings offer useful suggestions for enabling students to become acquainted with the proposed system's usage, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, and for improving student achievement more than the traditional methods of learning.
