AB The Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) project relies on geostationary imager-derived TOA broadband fluxes and cloud properties to account for the regional diurnal fluctuations between the Terra and Aqua CERES and MODIS measurements. The CERES project employs a ray-matching calibration algorithm in order to transfer the Aqua MODIS calibration to the geostationary (GEO) imagers, thereby allowing the derivation of consistent fluxes and cloud retrievals across the 16 GEO imagers utilized in the CERES record. The CERES Edition 4 processing scheme grants the opportunity to recalibrate the GEO record using an improved GEO/MODIS all-sky ocean ray-matching algorithm. Using a graduated angle matching method, which is most restrictive for anisotropic clear-sky ocean radiances and least restrictive for isotropic bright cloud radiances, reduces the bidirectional bias while preserving the dynamic range. Furthermore, SCIAMACHY hyperspectral radiances are used to account for both the solar incoming and Earth-reflected spectra in order to correct spectral band differences. As a result, the difference between the linear regression offset and the maintained GEO space count was reduced, and the calibration slopes computed from the linear fit and the regression through the space count agreed to within 0.4%. A deep convective cloud (DCC) ray-matching algorithm is also presented. The all-sky ocean and DCC ray-matching timeline gains are within 0.7% of one another. Because DCC are isotropic and the brightest, Earth targets with near-uniform visible spectra, the temporal standard error of GEO imager gains, are reduced by up to 60% from that of all-sky ocean targets.
