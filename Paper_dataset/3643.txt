AB With rapid development of a new generation of communication technology, sensor technology as well as big data technology, the application scenes of Internet of Things (IOT) based on these technologies increase constantly in extensive fields, for instance, there are great contributions of Internet of Things in fields such as smart home, intelligent transportation, intelligent healthcare, intelligent monitoring as well as intelligent agriculture. At present, as for intelligent agriculture, the main focus is monitoring agricultural environment with IOT and M2M technology. In the era of population explosion, agricultural resources such as farmland become more and more insufficient, a indoor intelligent agricultural IOT system is designed and implemented by the author in order to attack this conundrum. And the system directs an new trend for agricultural development. With the capability of parallel extension, the system can connect to large-scale indoor farms gradually thus to make these farms combining with each other organically. Finally, information mining shall be achieved based on large amount of sensing data by utilizing the big data technology and machine learning algorithms, and those derived information shall be adopted as critical reference to support indoor agricultural activities.
