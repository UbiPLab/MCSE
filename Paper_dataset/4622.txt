AB According to the forecast that billions of devices will get connected to the internet by 2020, it will become a challenge for real time applications to handle this huge data generated while considering security issues as well as time constraints. The cloud faces many issues like high latency, network failure, low storage capacity, extra computational capability and high computational power due to centralized server approach. These issues can be resolved by using a new concept called, Fog Computing. Fog computing is an emerging research area for both academia and industry. In this paper, we view and summarize different use case scenarios of fog computing. The recent research contributions on security and privacy issues in fog computing are also discussed in this paper. Finally, this paper also highlights several open issues in fog computing thereby giving light on future research directions for implementing fog computing systems.
