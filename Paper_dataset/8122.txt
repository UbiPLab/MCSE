AB In the field of cloud computing, lack of same capacity for devices as well as the lack of clear knowledge on the number of used devices lead to not use of practical algorithms easily, so using optimal algorithm is proper when any device fails to go beyond its maximum capacity. Also, in this paper, the stability of partitioning has been considered. In fact, a subgraph must be selected in terms of connectivity so that if a number of links are disconnected, its stability will not be missed and the program will run correctly. In this paper, a method was presented for partitioning the task graph of an application. Since the problem of large-scale graph partitioning is of the NP-hardness, the genetic algorithm was proposed as a selective structure in the proposed method. In the genetic algorithm, three criteria including cost, response time, and energy were used as a combined target. Use of linear programming effectively influences the optimal performance of the genetic algorithm. The results of the proposed method show accurate reduction in energy consumption and the response time by 0.5% and 3%, respectively.
