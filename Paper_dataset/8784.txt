AB Computer-generated holography is a technique of lossless and lens-less forming of images. Methods that use local devices to compute such holograms are very power- and time-consuming. In order to make it possible to transfer the calculations to the cloud, it is necessary to elaborate efficient algorithms of lossless compression. In this paper two methods of compression are presented and supported by both simulation and experimental results. A lossy compression method omitting certain bit-planes of holographic data is also presented, which allows a insignificant loss of information, while achieving a greater compression ratio.
