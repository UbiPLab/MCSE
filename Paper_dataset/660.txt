AB With the recent advancements in cloud computing technology, the number of cloud-based services has been gradually increasing. Symmetrically, users are asking for quality of experience (QoE) to be maintained or improved. To do this, it has become necessary to manage network resources more efficiently inside the cloud. Many theoretical studies for improving the users' QoE have been proposed. However, there are few practical solutions due to the lack of symmetry between implementation and theoretical researches. Hence, in this study, we propose a ranking table-based network resource allocation method that dynamically allocates network resources per service flow based on flow information periodically collected from a software defined network (SDN). It dynamically identifies the size of the data transmission for each service flow on the SDN and differentially allocates network resources to each service flow based on this size. As a result, it maintains the maximum QoE for the user by increasing the network utilization. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves 29.4% higher network efficiency than the general Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) method on average.
