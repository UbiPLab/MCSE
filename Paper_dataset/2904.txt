AB Computer generated holography is a method of using numerical methods to simulate the physical processes underlying a real hologram's optical recording and reconstruction i.e. the method of digitally generating holographic interference patterns. As such, it represents substantial progress compared to classical holography. A major disadvantage of this approach is the absence of specialized software tools for computer generated holograms and extremely high computer resource consumption, resulting in an excessive computing time. The goal of this paper is to create a physically plausible computer model for generating holograms, with a large potential for calculation optimization and acceleration, as well as the integration of this model into simple hologram creation software. We made software that simulates wave optics using previously known physical model to generate a hologram with the possibility of connection with commercial 3D tools via .obj documents. Considering that there is a problem of high computing resources consumption and time we have incorporated in our software the possibility of a parallel calculation for the purpose of testing, further software development and customization to optimize the computer generation of holograms.
