AB Path planning is a crucial task in any application using robot manipulators, especially when obstacles (OBSs) are present in the manipulator workspace (WS). In this paper, a planar robot manipulator and two multi-joint spatial robot manipulators are illustrated. It is presumed that OBSs located in the robots' WSs can be approximated with simple geometric shapes in two dimensions (2D) or three dimensions (3D). The spatial interference conditions between WSs and OBSs are classified into three types and are represented by graphics and mathematical set forms. A point cloud-based Monte Carlo method is used to generate not only the WSs but also the OBSs that imitate the measuring data from a sensor. Methods of ray and intersecting points which are based on computer graphics are used to depict the OBS avoiding planning workspace (OAPW) between WSs and OBSs. Furthermore, the systematic algorithm is extended to two 3D robot manipulators by computing the contour polygons of the OAPW in a series of planes perpendicular to the Z-axis. A comparison of multiple criteria among three significant methods on modelling the OAPW is presented in Section 7.
