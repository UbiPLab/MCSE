AB Fog computing is a new paradigm supporting the stringent requirements of mobility applications by bridging cloud computing and smart devices. Since the smart devices may be deployed in dynamic areas where are out of strict monitoring and protection, fog computing requires security protections to ensure confidentiality and integrity. In this article, to deal with security requirements and considering the distinctive features, a key management based on hypergraph schemed is designed. Firstly, based on the key hypergraph, the three hierarchy architecture of fog computing is divided into two subnetworks. Furthermore, each key management process of both two subnetworks is designed to satisfy the operational and security requirements of fog computing. Finally, the performance evaluation and numerical simulation have been provided to validate the proposed scheme.
