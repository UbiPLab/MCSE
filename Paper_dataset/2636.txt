ID DATA ENCRYPTION
AB Aimed at the problems of low data concealment rate and slow encryption speed in the current sensitive data leakage prevention method for ship communications, a new leakage prevention method under a cloud computing platform is put forward. First, the ship communication network was treated with k anonymization, and the sensitive data loss of the ship communication node cluster was calculated. Second, the sensitive data loss of anonymization in the whole-ship communication network was obtained by accumulating the sensitive data loss of the anonymous cluster of ship communication nodes, and then the loss rate of the sensitive data of ship communications was calculated. Finally, the elliptic encryption mechanism was adopted to achieve the encryption. It was found that with this method, the average concealment rate of sensitive data of ship communications is about 80%, and the average speed of sensitive data encryption for ship communications is up to 33 MB/s. The experiment proves that with good concealment performance, this method can prevent sensitive data leakage and improve the concealment rate and encryption speed.
