DE Information flow; separation; cloud computing; non-interference security
AB Separation is the primary consideration in cloud computing security. A series of security and safety problems would arise if a separation mechanism is not deployed appropriately, thus affecting the confidence of cloud end-users. In this paper, together with characteristics of cloud computing, the separation issue in cloud computing has been analyzed from the perspective of information flow. The process of information flow in cloud computing systems is formalized to propose corresponding separation rules. These rules have been verified in this paper and it is shown that the rules conform to non-interference security, thus ensuring the security and practicability of the proposed rules.
