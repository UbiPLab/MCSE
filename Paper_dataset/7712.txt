AB Cloud computing has been widely adopted by enterprises because of its on-demand and elastic resource usage paradigm. Currently most cloud applications are running on one single cloud. However, more and more applications demand to run across several clouds to satisfy the requirements like best cost efficiency, avoidance of vender lock-in, and geolocation sensitive service. JointCloud computing is a new research initiated by Chinese institutes to address the computing issues concerned with multiple clouds. In JointCloud, users' diverse and dynamic requirements on cloud resources are satisfied by providing users virtual cloud (VC) for special purposes. A virtual cloud for special purposes is in essence a user's specific cloud working environment having the customized software stacks, configurations and computing resources readily available. This paper first introduces what is JointCloud computing and then describes the design rationales, motivation examples, mechanisms and enabling technologies of VC in JointCloud.
