AB Web service composition is one of the core technologies of realizing service-oriented computing. Web service composition satisfies the requirements of users to form new value-added services by composing existing services. As Cloud Computing develops, the emergence of Web services with different quality yet similar functionality has brought new challenges to service composition optimization problem. How to solve large-scale service composition in the Cloud Computing environment has become an urgent problem. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a parallel optimization approach based on Spark distributed environment. Firstly, the parallel covering algorithm is used to cluster the Web services. Next, the multiple clustering centers obtained are used as the starting point of the particles to improve the diversity of the initial population. Then, according to the parallel data coding rules of resilient distributed dataset (RDD), the large-scale combination service is generated with the proposed algorithm named Spark Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (SPSO). Finally, the usage of particle elite selection strategy removes the inert particles to optimize the performance of the combination of service selection. This paper adopts real data set WS-Dream to prove the validity of the proposed method with a large number of experimental results.
