AB In computer network security, IP address spoofing plays a major role in the creation of Internet Protocol (IP) packets with a fake or forged source IP address and this may lead to major attacks to cloud centre. When the identities of user information are forged by spoofing or masquerade as another computing system. Whether the basic protocol for sending data in the Internet communication are based on the Internet Protocol ("IP"). In network communication header of each IP packet consist of source and destination address of the packet. The source address contains where the packet was sent origin address. In that IP spoofing can be performed by forging the original header from sender it act like packet is sent from origin with different address, an attacker can make it appear that the packet was sent by a different machine. So that the IP Spoofing attack can be placed to further attacks comes into place of impersonating system. This can avoided by a novel solution, named Passive IP Trace back (PIT), to avoid the challenges in operation. To capture the origins of IP spoofing traffic is difficult to locate. As long as the real locations of spoofing are not identified, they cannot be determined from launching further attacks. Identifying the origins of spoofing traffic can help build a reputation system for network place, which would be helpful to push the corresponding ISPs to verify IP source address.
