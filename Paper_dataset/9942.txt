AB This research work considers a scenario of cloud computing job-shop scheduling problems. We consider m realtime jobs with various lengths and n machines with different computational speeds and costs. Each job has a deadline to be met, and the profit of processing a packet of a job differs from other jobs. Moreover, considered deadlines are either hard or soft and a penalty is applied if a deadline is missed where the penalty is considered as an exponential function of time. The scheduling problem has been formulated as a mixed integer non-linear programming problem whose objective is to maximize net profit. The formulated problem is computationally hard and not solvable in deterministic polynomial time. This research work proposes an algorithm named the Tube-tap algorithm as a solution to this scheduling optimization problem. Extensive simulation shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing solutions in terms of maximizing net -profit and preserving deadlines.
