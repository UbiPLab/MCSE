AB Intensive video and cloud computing services are putting much pressure on metro networks to meet stringent requirements such as low latency, low power consumption, and high spectral efficiency, where the system cost is sensitive. To address this challenge, we introduce a special elastic optical network paradigm called the ultradense wavelength switched network (UD-WSN) for metro optical networks. The architecture supports a spectrum granularity (e.g., 6.25 GHz or even 5 GHz) finer than the current smallest standardized 12.5 GHz, which enables more efficient spectrum utilization when provisioning metro low-speed service connections (e.g., sub-1G/1G/10G services). The performance of UD-WSN is evaluated from the techno-economic perspective in comparison with the conventional OTN over DWDM network. Case studies demonstrate the merits of the proposed architecture. Considering the promising potential of UD-WSN, we also suggest several open research issues for it.
