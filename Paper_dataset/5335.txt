AB The problem of resource provisioning and content placement in cloud-based content delivery networks is studied, and a two-stage resource provisioning and cloud assignment is proposed based on dynamic large and small-scale fluctuations of user demand rates as well as considering a constrained minimum lease time for resources. In the first stage, we perform resource provisioning while costs of resources, quality of service (QoS) violation, and cloud-based root server redirection are included in the optimization, and constraints of QoS and limited resource of cloud sites are taken into account. In the second stage, cloud site assignment is conducted where for fixed allocated resources, QoS violation and cloud-based root server redirection costs are minimized or reduced using three different proposed schemes. We further show that reassignment of cloud sites during rising demand rates within a lease time period improves revenue, while reassignment is not very effective for falling demand rates.
