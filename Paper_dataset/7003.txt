AB Dose rate coefficients computed using the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) reference adult female voxel phantom were compared with values computed using the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) adult female stylized phantom in an air submersion exposure geometry. This is a continuation of previous work comparing monoenergetic organ dose rate coefficients for the male adult phantoms. With both the male and female data computed, effective dose rate as defined by ICRP Publication 103 was compared for both phantoms. Organ dose rate coefficients for the female phantom and ratios of organ dose rates for the voxel and stylized phantoms are provided in the energy range from 30 to 5 MeV. Analysis of the contribution of the organs to effective dose is also provided. Comparison of effective dose rates between the voxel and stylized phantoms was within 8% at 100 keV and is < 5% between 200 and 5000 keV.
