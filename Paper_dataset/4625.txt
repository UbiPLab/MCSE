AB The energy-saving of mobile devices during their application offloading process has always been the research hotspot in the field of mobile cloud computing (MCC). In this paper, we focus on the scenario where multiple mobile devices with MCC and non-MCC services coexist. A bandwidth allocation and the corresponding transmission rate scheduling schemes are proposed with the objectives of simultaneously maximizing the overall system throughput and minimizing the energy consumption of individual mobile device with MCC service. To allocate the bandwidth to all mobile devices, two different algorithms are proposed, i.e., 0-1 integer programming algorithm and Lagrange dual algorithm. The transmission rate scheduling scheme for mobile device with MCC service is presented based on reverse order iteration method. The numerical results suggest that energy consumed by individual mobile device with MCC service can be remarkably saved while the overall system throughput can also be maximized. Moreover, the results show that 0-1 integer programming algorithm can get greater system throughput but has higher computational complexity, which means the algorithm is more suitable for small-scale systems, whereas Lagrange dual algorithm can achieve a good balance between the performance and computational complexity.
