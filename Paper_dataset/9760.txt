AB Knowing the trust level of cloud service providers is a significant issue in the field of cloud computing for privacy and security reasons. The idea of this paper is to build up a Consumer and Cloud-Data Envelopment Analysis (CCDEA) trust assessment model for evaluating cloud services in two stages. In first stage, the believability index of each cloud Consumer (C) is calculated. The second stage incorporates Cloud-Data Envelopment Analysis (C-DEA) model for the trust assessment of cloud services from the viewpoint of cloud consumers. Several experiments were conducted and the results were analyzed to show the stability of our method in measuring the relative efficiency and effectiveness of cloud services through ranking mechanism.
