AB This paper compares several computing paradigms for smartphones: 1) Using multicore mobile CPU for accelerating computations; 2) Using mobile GPU for accelerating computations; 3 Using mobile cloud computing with visualization of a 3D scene on the mobile device; 4) Using mobile cloud computing with visualization of images on the mobile device. The tests were performed for cloth simulation and more precisely for dressing a virtual garment on a human body. The results are analysed and corresponding conclusions are drawn. One of the important findings is that using the mobile GPU for general computations, e.g. for simulation of garments up to a certain cloth resolution, is the fastest and at the same time the most energy efficient method.
