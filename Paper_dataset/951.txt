AB With the development of logistics, a well-designed distribution plan plays an important role in the distribution process. In order to improve the economic benefit of enterprise and customer satisfaction, this paper introduces the consumer value into disruption management for vehicle routing problem (VRP). Based on the consumer value that computed through expert evaluation and cloud model, the cloud model was adopted to classify the target consumers into three levels. Then, a consumer value-based VRP disruption management was established, which measures the deviations from the perspectives of consumer, distribution centre and driver. After that, the tree-seed algorithm (TSA) was improved by the immune algorithm (IA) to solve the established model, and proved valid through simulation. The research findings shed new light on the routing of distribution vehicles in the event of disruptions.
