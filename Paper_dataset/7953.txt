AB The cloud computing era has brought significant challenges in energy and operational costs of data centers. As a result, green initiatives with regard to energy-efficient management of data center infrastructure for cloud computing have become essential. Addressing a big class of widely deployed data centers with relatively consistent workload and applications, this paper presents a new profile-based application assignment approach for greener and more energy-efficient data centers. It builds realistic profiles from the raw data measured from data centers and then establishes a theoretical framework for profile-based application assignment. A penalty-based profile matching algorithm (PPMA) is further developed to obtain an assignment solution, which gives near-optimal allocations whilst satisfying energy-efficiency, resource utilization efficiency and application completion time constraints. Through experimental studies, the profiling approach is demonstrated to be feasible, scalable and energy-efficient when compared to the commonly used general and workload history based application management approaches.
