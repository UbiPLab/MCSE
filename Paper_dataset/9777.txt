AB As the organizations are shifting their workload on cloud computing, the demand of cloud services has increased tremendously. With the increased usage of cloud data centers, there is huge consumption of energy (power and heat), contributing to high operational costs and carbon footprints to the environment. So far, research has been carried out to optimize energy usage for cloud resources. However, most of the work on energy optimization is centered on the operational phase of a data center. This paper focuses on energy reduction at Service Level Agreement (SLA) level. Cloud resources are provisioned with Green SLA aware cloud resource reservation (GSLACRR) algorithm. This work proposes Green Service Level Agreement (GSLA) template and negotiation strategies for cloud services. It offers cloud resource services in an energy efficient manner to the users.
