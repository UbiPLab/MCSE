AB The paper considers a method for evaluation of transport flow parameters and determine an efficiency of variants concerning organization of traffic movement and provision of qualitative transportation. A method for evaluation of main traffic flow parameters while using a two-fluid mathematical model of Herman - Prigogine has been developed and it is based on passive processing of navigation data for road transport facilities on highways and urban road and street networks. The main advantages and novelty of the method (in contrast with the traditional usage of a mathematical model of Herman - Prigogine on the basis of active processing of navigation data) are the following: a passive treatment of GPS-tracks and support of their formats that make it possible significantly improve quality and adequacy of the model results; cloud computing (usage of cloud storage for storing large bulk of data); presence of client mobile application for Android operating system which is used for data collection in addition to operation with already collected navigation data from navigation and information center and other sources; application for calculation and processing of modern web technologies; scalability and configurability of the system. Efficiency of the proposed algorithms, mathematical models for evaluation of transport flow parameters and system as a whole have been proved in the process of their approbation while using a set of tracks on main highways of Belarus.
