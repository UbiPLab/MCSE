AB The state-of-the-art indexing mechanisms for distributed cloud data management systems can not support complex queries, such as multi-dimensional query and range query. To solve this problem, we propose a multi-dimensional indexing mechanism named PR-Chord to support complex queries. PR-Chord is composed of the global index named PR-Index and the Chord network. The multi-dimensional space formed by the range of the multi-dimensional data is divided into hyper-rectangle spaces equally. The PR-Index is a hierarchical index structure based on the improved PR quadtree to index these spaces. The complex query is transformed into the query of leaf nodes of PR-Index. We design the algorithms of query, insertion and deletion to support complex queries. Since PR-Index does not store the multi-dimensional data, its maintenance cost is zero. PR-Chord has the advantages of load balancing and simple algorithm. The experiment results demonstrate that PR-Chord has good query efficiency.
