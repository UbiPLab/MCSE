AB During the last decade, cloud computing became a natural choice to host and provide various computing resources as on-demand services. To better satisfy user requirements, cloud services may be combined while considering the constraints of the virtualized environment, including security policies, resources availability, and interoperability. Extensive surveys have been conducted to study the major issues related to the cloud service composition problem. However, very few works have studied such issues in a multicloud setting. To fill this gap, we provide in this paper a systematic literature review on multicloud service composition. We start with a background on service composition in single clouds. Then, we present the multicloud taxonomy, and we study how service composition was tackled by researchers in multicloud environments. Finally, we identify the challenges and the requirements of multicloud service composition, as well as the future directions.
