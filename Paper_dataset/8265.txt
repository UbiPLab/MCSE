AB Scientific analyses commonly compose multiple single-process programs into a dataflow. An end-to-end dataflow of single-process programs is known as a many-task application. Typically, HPC tools are used to parallelize these analyses. In this work, we investigate an alternate approach that uses Apache Spark-a modern platform for data intensive computing-to parallelize many-task applications. We implement Kira, a flexible and distributed astronomy image processing toolkit, and its Source Extractor (Kira SE) application. Using Kira SE as a case study, we examine the programming flexibility, dataflow richness, scheduling capacity and performance of Apache Spark running on the Amazon EC2 cloud. By exploiting data locality, Kira SE achieves a 4.1x speedup over an equivalent C program when analyzing a 1TB dataset using 512 cores on the Amazon EC2 cloud. Furthermore, Kira SE on the Amazon EC2 cloud achieves a 1.8x speedup over the C program on the NERSC Edison supercomputer. A 128-core Amazon EC2 cloud deployment of Kira SE using Spark Streaming can achieve a second-scale latency with a sustained throughput of similar to 800 MB/s. Our experience with Kira demonstrates that data intensive computing platforms like Apache Spark are a performant alternative for many-task scientific applications.
