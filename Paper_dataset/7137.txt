AB A semi-probabilistic approach used in current design codes requires calibrated partial factors to secure safety of structures and people. The current code calibration procedure has an inefficient and imprecise iterative loop and it also neglects economical aspects which should be an integral part of any code calibration. This paper suggests a modified approach to the reliability-based code calibration which eliminates disadvantages of the original procedure and it is defined in a way to take advantage of the current computation means such as parallel and cloud computing. The modified approach was used to calibrate the partial factors for the structural verification of UHPFRC thin elements predominantly loaded in bending. The described example proves efficiency of the modified approach and it illustrates the advantages of the reliability-based code calibration. Indeed, the design method of UHPFRC with the calibrated partial factors allows better exploitation of the material without compromising the safety requirements. Because of the straightforward procedure, independent reliability and design computations, and selection of the ideal partial factors at the end of the calibration procedure, the modified approach is an ideal option for various code calibrations. It is worth noting that the modified approach can "grow'' with development of material, knowledge, applications, and safety requirements due its simple updating which was not possible before. Moreover, the removal of the iterative loop allows using Monte Carlo methods (among other options) which are normally time-consuming and impractical for code calibration.
