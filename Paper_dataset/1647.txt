AB Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common eye disease and a significant cause of blindness in diabetic patients. Regular screening with fundus photography and timely intervention is the most effective way to manage the disease. The large population of diabetic patients and their massive screening requirements have generated interest in a computer-aided and fully automatic diagnosis of DR. Deep neural networks, on the other hand, have brought many breakthroughs in various tasks in the recent years. To automate the diagnosis of DR and provide appropriate suggestions to DR patients, we have built a dataset of DR fundus images that have been labeled by the proper treatment method that is required. Using this dataset, we trained deep convolutional neural network models to grade the severities of DR fundus images. We were able to achieve an accuracy of 88.72% for a four-degree classification task in the experiments. We deployed our models on a cloud computing platform and provided pilot DR diagnostic services for several hospitals; in the clinical evaluation, the system achieved a consistency rate of 91.8% with ophthalmologists, demonstrating the effectiveness of our work.
