AB Recently, vehicular cloud computing (VCC) has emerged as the one of the fast growing technologies with an aim to provide uninterrupted services to the moving clients even on-the-fly. One of the services provided by VCC is the mobile healthcare in which patient can be provided diagonosis from anywhere during their mobility. This paper proposes an intelligent RFID-enabled authentication scheme for healthcare applications in VCC environment. In the proposed scheme, a Petri Nets-based authentication model is used for authentication of tags, and readers. Both server, and tag authentications are protected by strong elliptical curve cryptography (ECC)-based key generation mechanism. The proposed scheme is found to be secure with respect to mutual authentication of servers and tags, replay attack, tracking attack, users anonymity, eavesdropping, and cloning with forward secrecy. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, it is evaluated with respect to the overhead generated, computation complexity, and % service delivery, where its performance is found better than the case where it is not applied.
