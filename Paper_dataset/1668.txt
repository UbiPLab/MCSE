AB Improved quality of life has lead the healthcare industry to geographically expand and support real-time services. Following this trend, a surge of healthcare monitoring devices has substantially overgrown in the global market. These devices tend to generate data in humon-gous quantity that need real-time analysis with seamless and secure transmission to the computing nodes. The existing computing and networking infrastructures fall short to cater the services with desirable quality of service. Hence, to overcome these challenges, the proposed work presents a comprehensive platform referred as software defined network (SDN) Assisted Framework for Edge-Cloud Interplay in Secure Healthcare Ecosystem (SAFE). The objectives of SAFE include: first, an offloading scheme to support edge-cloud interplay, second, an SDN-assisted virtualized flow management scheme, and, third, a secure Lattice-based cryptosystem. Finally, the proposed scheme is validated on different performance parameters. Additionally, a security evaluation of the designed cryptosystem is also presented. The results obtained indicate the supremacy of the designed framework.
