AB Rotary tables are often used to speed up the acquisition time during the 3D scanning of complex geometries. In order to avoid manual registration of the point clouds acquired with different orientations, automatic algorithms to compensate the rotation were developed. Alternatively, a proper calibration of the rotary axis with respect to the camera system is needed. Several methods are available in the literature, but they only consider a single-axis calibration. In this paper, a method for the simultaneous calibration of both axes of the table is proposed. A checkerboard is attached to the table, and several images with different poses are acquired. An optimization algorithm is then setup to determine the orientation and the locations of the two axes. A metric to assess the calibration quality was also defined by computing the average mean reprojection error. This metric is used to investigate the optimal number and distribution of the calibration poses, demonstrating that the optimum calibration results are achieved when a wider dispersion of the calibration poses is adopted.
