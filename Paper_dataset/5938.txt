AB In this letter, we investigate an energy efficiency with performance guaranteed problem in mobile-edge computing. The mobile users desire lower energy consumption with better performance of tasks, for that we propose an energy minimizing optimization problem for mobile-edge cloud computing. We apply KKT conditions to solve it, and also present a request offloading scheme for this issue. In particular, the offloading scheme is determined by energy consumption and bandwidth capacity at each time slot. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed offloading scheme outperforms local computing and entirely offloading method on energy consumption and performance on delay.
