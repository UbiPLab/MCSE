AB An important aspect of modern computer systems is their ability to adapt. This is particularly important in the context of the use of mobile devices, which have limited resources and are able to work longer and more efficiently through adaptation. One possibility for the adaptation of mobile service execution is the use of the Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) paradigm, which allows such services to run in computational clouds and only return the result to the mobile device. At the same time, the importance of machine learning used to optimize various computer systems is increasing. The novel concept proposed by the authors extends the MCC paradigm to add the ability to run services on a PC (e.g. at home). The solution proposed utilizes agent-based concepts in order to create a system that operates in a heterogeneous environment. Machine learning algorithms are used to optimize the performance of mobile services online on mobile devices. This guarantees scalability and privacy. As a result, the solution makes it possible to reduce service execution time and power consumption by mobile devices. In order to evaluate the proposed concept, an agent-based system for mobile service adaptation was implemented and experiments were performed. The solution developed demonstrates that extending the MCC paradigm with the simultaneous use of machine learning and agent-based concepts allows for the effective adaptation and optimization of mobile services.
