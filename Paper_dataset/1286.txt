AB Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) are the collection of patient's health data systematically in a digital format. They eliminate the complicated paper-based medical records and ensure the accuracy and legibility of health data to improve quality care. As the amount of the EMRs explosion, the traditional medical system is unable to equip with sufficient storage and computing capacities. Therefore, it is crucial to outsourcing this EMRs to the cloud server, which is a flexible and cost-effective mode in data management. However, the loss of control over the patient's EMRs makes it a severe challenge in the integrity of outsourced data. In this paper, we propose an efficient certificateless provable data possession (CL-PDP) scheme without bilinear pairing for the EMRs stored in the cloud medical server. A formal security proof on the random oracle model demonstrates the security of our proposal. In addition, our CL-PDP protocol satisfies the following properties: unconditionally anonymous, privacy preservation, public verifiability, and reliability of the trusted third party. At last, an elaborate performance evaluation with other related schemes shows that this proposal is efficient and practical.
