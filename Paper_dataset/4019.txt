AB With the emergence of new services such as high-definition video, cloud computing and virtual reality, the load's bandwidth prediction ability is necessary to support soaring services request bandwidth with diversified characteristics and requirements. In this paper, a novel bandwidth allocation algorithm based on differential bandwidth request prediction (BRP) models is proposed. This algorithm firstly combines linear prediction and nonlinear prediction. According to different characteristics of services, the linear prediction model and the Kalman-filter prediction model are used to predict request bandwidths of corresponding services. By the differential BRP models, the proposed algorithm can greatly better the accuracy of service's request bandwidth prediction and the efficiency of allocating bandwidth. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed models and algorithm can reduce network's average delay, increase throughput and bandwidth utilization.
