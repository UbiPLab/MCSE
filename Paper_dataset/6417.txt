AB Besides enabling an enhanced mobile broadband, the next generation of mobile networks (5G) are envisioned for the support of massive connectivity for heterogeneous Internets of Things. These IoTs are envisioned for a large number of use cases including smart cities, environment monitoring, smart vehicles, and so on. Unfortunately, most IoTs have very limited computing and storage capabilities and need cloud services. Hence, connecting these devices through 5G systems requires huge spectrum resources in addition to handling massive connectivity and improved security. This article discusses the challenges facing the support of IoTs through 5G systems. The focus is devoted to discussing physical layer limitations in terms of spectrum resources and radio access channel connectivity. We show how sparsity can be exploited for addressing these challenges, especially in terms of enabling wideband spectrum management and handling the connectivity by exploiting device-to-device communications and edge cloud. Moreover, we identify major open problems and research directions that need to be explored toward enabling the support of massive heterogeneous IoTs through 5G systems.
