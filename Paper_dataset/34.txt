AB By exploiting the massive data generated from the numerous interconnected machines and control systems, industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) provides unprecedented opportunities for facilitating the intelligence and smartness of manufacturing. Timely processing the large-scaled IIoT data by the conventional computation framework, such as Cloud computing, however, is nontrivial due to its costly resource usage, intolerable delay, and unbearable backbone pressures. By leveraging the idle resources of smart objects at the edge, mobile device cloud (MDC) becomes promising for the IIoT data analysis, thanks to the flexible resource provision and nearby task offloading. However, MDC workers are mostly human-carried devices with large scale, high dynamic resource provision, and untruthful behaviors, which pose significant challenges on MDC task allocation. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized and truthful framework for MDC (BC-MDC). BC-MDC enables the decentralization and prevents dishonesty by incorporating a plasma-based blockchain into the MDC. We design four smart contracts for distributedly managing the worker registration, task posting/allocation, rewarding, and penalizing. Furthermore, MDC task allocation is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem that jointly minimizes the long-term processing cost and risk of task failing. We also design a truthful reward/penalty algorithm that stimulates workers to provide resources and enforce them to keep the promise as well. Collaborated by the extensive simulation tests, we show how our proposed scheme achieves low cost on usage and high truthfulness and outperforms state-of-the-art solutions.
