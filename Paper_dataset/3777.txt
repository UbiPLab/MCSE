ID SERVICE COMPOSITION
AB We propose a server selection, configuration, reconfiguration and automatic performance verification technology to meet user functional and performance requirements on various types of cloud compute servers. Various servers mean there are not only virtual machines on normal CPU servers but also container or baremetal servers on strong graphic processing unit (GPU) servers or field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) with a configuration that accelerates specified computation. Early cloud systems are composed of many PC-like servers, and virtual machines on these severs use distributed processing technology to achieve high computational performance. However, recent cloud systems change to make the best use of advances in hardware power. It is well known that baremetal and container performances are better than virtual machines performances. And dedicated processing servers, such as strong GPU servers for graphics processing, and FPGA servers for specified computation, have increased. Our objective for this study was to enable cloud providers to provision compute resources on appropriate hardware based on user requirements, so that users can benefit from high performance of their applications easily. Our proposed technology select appropriate servers for user compute resources from various types of hardware, such as GPUs and FPGAs, or set appropriate configurations or reconfigurations of FPGAs to use hardware power. Furthermore, our technology automatically verifies the performances of provisioned systems. We measured provisioning and automatic performance verification times to show the effectiveness of our technology.
