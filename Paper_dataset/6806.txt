AB As the technology has developed, cloud computing which is a kind of Internet-based computing has widely spread. In terms of operating cloud system in remote locations, there exist some problems when the failure of cloud system occurs. In such cases, workers need to go to the remote locations and maintain the system. This paper considers stochastic models of a redundant cloud system in remote locations. The cloud system has active devices and standby devices. We derive the steady-state availability and discuss optimal policies which maximize it. Finally, numerical examples are given.
