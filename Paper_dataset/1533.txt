AB E-learning becomes popular with the popularization of smart portable devices and draws lots of investments from universities and educational institutions. Furthermore, the traditional classroom teaching pattern due to many reasons needs to be improved, such as insufficient communication and less interactivity. Thus, this study tries to introduce E-learning resources, e.g., Massive Online Open Course and Small Private Online Course, into classroom teaching to enrich classroom teaching means to relieve the issues in remote education widely existed in China. To reduce the bandwidth consumption of online video learning applications, the collaborative edge and core clouds are used to place E-learning resource and their architectures are subtly designed to reduce the network delay. Then, the E-learning systems are introduced to classroom teaching to enrich the modern teaching and learning means, such as problem-driven learning methods, individualized teaching case context, and grouping collaborative learning strategy. Several years' teaching practices in the course of Fundamental Computers show that the proposed teaching approaches have received welcome widely and guaranteed the teaching effectiveness.
