AB This paper studies the joint scheduling of subcarrier, base station, transmit power, and virtual machine in multi-cell cellular edge computing systems to minimize the total delay experienced by tasks of users. Traditional work considers the queue length based Lyapunov function and designs the corresponding scheduling algorithms. This work considers the delay based Lyapunov function. Firstly, the delay of the communication and computing queues in multi-cell cellular edge computing systems is modeled as the virtual delay queue based on which a delay based Lyapunov function is defined. Then, the joint subcarrier allocation, base station selection, power control, and virtual machine scheduling algorithms are proposed to minimize the conditional drift of the delay based Lyapunov function. Simulation results show the proposed scheduling algorithm performs better than the traditional queue length based one in the performance of total delay.
