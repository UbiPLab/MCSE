AB Advances in cloud computing and GPU virtualization are allowing the game industry to move into a cloud gaming era. In this paper, we consider multiplayer cloud gaming (MCG), which is the natural integration of multiplayer online gaming and cloud gaming paradigms. With MCG, a game server and a set of rendering servers for the players need to be located and launched in the clouds for each game session. We formulate an MCG server allocation problem with the objective of minimizing the total server rental and bandwidth cost charged by the cloud to support an MCG session. The MCG server allocation problem is hard to solve optimally. We propose several efficient heuristics to address the problem and carry out theoretical analysis for the proposed hill-climbing algorithm. We conduct extensive experiments using real Internet latency and cloud pricing datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms as well as several alternatives. Experimental results show that our best algorithm can achieve near-optimal cost under real-time latency constraints.
