AB In the current scenario, the concept of Smart Cities is one of the emerging and challenging research areas. The cities are surrounded by forests, agricultural land, or open areas, where fire incidence can occur threatening human life and causing many resources to become extinct. This article aims to design an early fire detection system to get rid of fire events using the concept of senor network and UAV's technology. The architecture proposal is based on sensors for monitoring environmental parameters and to process the information through sensors and IoT application. The proposed fire detection system is the combination of wireless sensor technologies, UAVs, and cloud computing. Some image processing techniques are also integrated into the proposed fire detection system to identify the fire event with better accuracy and used as an integrated solution. To improve the true detection rate, rules are also designed. The simulation results of the proposed fire detection system are compared with several existing methods. It is observed that the proposed system has a higher fire detection rate to improve the true detection of forest fire from 95 to 98 percent.
