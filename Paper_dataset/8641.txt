DE Cloud computing; e-learning exams; secure exchange
AB In some e-learning and blended-learning institutions, such as the Saudi Electronic University (SEU) in Saudi Arabia, prior to the students undertaking exams, the exam questions are distributed to and shared among faculty members. This is done by email which poses a high security risk. Hence, using email for the exchange of confidential files such as exams in learning institutions can cause the issues of latency, human error, and related security concerns. Therefore, this paper presents a system to secure the digital content of exam questions and their transmission in e-learning institutions, enabling the control of access to content with suitable management features for security, auditing, and archiving using leading technology solutions for content management and security. The results of our simulation showed that the proposed system provides a faster and more secure access to and exchange of exams between the instructors and the college and the campus supervisor. Moreover, our system reduces the likelihood that there will be errors in exams and subsequent delay.
