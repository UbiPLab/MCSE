AB Be different from traditional Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) access control systems for cloud computing, this paper first proposes a new access architecture on mobile cloud, which introduces a middle layer sitting between mobile devices and their cloud infrastructure. This middle layer is composed of cloudlets which are deployed next to wireless network access points (APs) and serve as a localized service point at a mobile devices close proximity to improve the performance of mobile cloud services. Based on this new architecture, an ABE access control scheme is proposed to offload the main amount of computations to the cloudlet as the function of cloud, in which the access control decision making takes into consideration energy consumption of access task execution and network status while satisfying certain response time constraints. Then the analysis results have shown the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed system architecture in terms of security and energy consumption.
