AB With the expanding application of cloud services, issues on cloud-based network data security have become major concerns. The problem of network data security based on cloud computing was analyzed in this study. The key technologies in cloud computing and data security and their respective functions were described. Moreover, the principles and methods of the proposed attribute-based encryption algorithm and data dynamic operation verification algorithm were also described. Finally, experimental results were analyzed and discussed. Results showed that the proposed algorithm is more advantageous than other schemes and can provide a favorable direction to future research on network data security in cloud computing.
