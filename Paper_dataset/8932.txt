AB In cloud storage systems, data security management is becoming a serious matter. Big data and accessibility power is increasingly high, though the benefits are clear, such a service is also relinquishing users' physical possession of their outsourced data, which inevitably poses new security risks toward the correctness of the data in cloud. As a result, cloud storage security has become one of the driving components in Cloud Computing regarding to data manipulation trust on both hosting center and on-transit. This paper proposes a TPM-Based Security over Multi-Cloud Storage Architecture (MCSA) grounded on Erasure Codes to apply root of trust based on hardware authenticity. An erasure codes such as Reed-Solomon, is capable of assuring stability in storage costs with best practice to guarantee data accessibility failure recovery. A Multi-Cloud Control Node manages other Control Nodes evolved in the cloud; this work introduces TPM-Based Security functions per Control node in the architecture. This concept will resolve a number of storage security issues, hence Cloud Computing adoption.
