AB Mobile cloud computing ( MCC) can significantly improve the processing/storage capacity and standby time of mobile terminals by migrating data processing and storage to the remote cloud. However, due to the wireless resource limitations of access points/base stations, data streaming of MCC suffers poor quality-of-service ( QoS) in multiuser multiservice scenarios, such as long buffering time and intermittent disruptions. In this paper, we propose a backoff-based wireless resource scheduling ( BWRS) scheme, in which real-time services have higher priority than non-real-time services. BWRS can improve the QoS of real-time streams and the overall performance of MCC networks. We formulate an M/M/1 queueing model and propose a queueing-delay-optimal control algorithm to minimize the average queueing delay of non-real-time services. Furthermore, a delay-constrained control algorithm is developed not only to minimize the queueing delay of non-real-time services of multiservice users but to support users' non-real-time services under delay constraints as well. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can minimize the average queueing delay while still meeting the delay requirement and can significantly improve blocking probability and channel utilization.
