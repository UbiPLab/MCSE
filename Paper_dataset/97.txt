AB We model the efficiency of loading atoms of various species into a one-dimensional optical lattice from a cold ensemble, taking into account the initial cloud temperature and size, the lattice laser properties affecting the trapping potential, and the atomic parameters. Stochastic sampling and dynamical evolution are used to simulate the transfer, leading to estimates of transfer efficiency for varying trap depth and profile. Tracing the motion of the atoms also enables the evaluation of the equilibrium temperature and site occupancy in the lattice. The simulation compares favorably against a number of experimental results and is used to compute an optimum lattice-waist-to-cloud-radius ratio for a given optical power.
