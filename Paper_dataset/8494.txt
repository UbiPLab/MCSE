AB We propose a class of n-variable Boolean functions which can be used to implement quantum secure multiparty computation. We also give an implementation of a special quantum secure multiparty computation protocol. An advantage of our protocol is that only 1 qubit is needed to compute the n-tuple pairwise and function, which is more efficient comparing with previous protocols. We demonstrate our protocol on the IBM quantum cloud platform, with a probability of correct output as high as 94.63%. Therefore, our protocol presents a promising generalization in realization of various secure multipartite quantum tasks.
