AB The Petri net (PN) formalism is a suitable tool for modeling parallel systems due to its basic characteristics, such as synchronization. The extension of PN, the Colored Petri Nets (CPN) allows the incorporation of more details of the real system into the model (for example, contention for shared resources). The CPNs have been widely used in a variety of fields to produce suitable models. One of their biggest strengths is that their overall philosophy is quite similar to the philosophy of the object-oriented paradigm. In this regard, the CPN models can be used to implement simulators in a rather straightforward way. In this paper, the CPN framework is employed to implement a new resource allocation simulator, which is used to verify the performance of our previous work, where we proposed a fair resource allocation scheme with flow control and maximum utilization of the system's resources.
