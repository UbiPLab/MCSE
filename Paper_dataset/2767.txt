AB Recently, an increasingly large number of high-performance computing (HPC) applications have been developed and hosted in clouds. The cloud computing scheme provides a model of utility computing, which is often implemented in the form of big data centers. As HPC applications are usually resource intensive, how to exploit economies of scale to harmonize the resource allocation among large-scale HPC applications under performance constraints often poses a significant challenge on the load-balance scheduling policies in big data platforms. In view of this challenge, in this paper we propose a Resource Co-Allocation method, named RCA, for load-balance scheduling. Technically, the method is promoted by four steps that are enacted in a hierarchical control framework. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method are validated by extensive experiments.
