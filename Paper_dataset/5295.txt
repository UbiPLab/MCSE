AB The standard office or business in Botswana hosts their resources in-house. This means that a company will have their hardware, software and support staff as part of their daily work operations. Technology has brought a shift to the office environment with Cloud Computing. Botswana has seen the growth of the Cloud Technologies, within its own boundaries where companies have embraced the new technology to mobilize and push their operational agenda with the same tenacity as the rest of the world using the technology. Cloud computing has taken root in Botswana and it shows that a lot of SMEs are using cloud computing, whilst some are non-adopters to the technology. Edgar Tsimane reported the take up on cloud computing in Botswana. Botswana uses the National ICT policy to guide on technological advances and development, i.e the Maitlamo policy. This paper is considering aspects influencing the company's decisions on utilizing the cloud as a service, both opportunistic and challenges. Some of the questions to address for the study are: how effective is cloud computing for businesses in Botswana; what challenges and successes these companies have had, is there any particular framework they had to follow to guide them in adopting the services? Finally, the paper was to take consideration in recommending a framework that can be adopted within the Botswana.
