AB To effectively improve the operation, management, and service level of the intelligent park, a preliminary study and discussion is conducted on the design and implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT) information system in the intelligent park. Firstly, the hardware architecture and technical scheme of the information system of intelligent park based on Internet of things and cloud computing are proposed, and the information system architecture of the intelligent park is introduced. The construction of the system architecture is based on the three-tier architecture of perception, network and application; secondly, based on this system architecture, the functions of each component of the information system are explained from the perception layer, network layer and application layer, and some typical sensors in the system are introduced; finally, the system is analyzed experimentally. The results show that the system can realize the interconnection among various communication terminals and improve the efficiency of cooperation among various systems. It can be concluded that the information system of the intelligent park based on cloud computing and Internet of things can achieve the desired effect.
