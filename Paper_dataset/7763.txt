AB In this paper, we explore the process of emotional state transition. And the process is impacted by emotional state of interaction objects. First of all, the cognitive reasoning process and the micro-expressions recognition is the basis of affective computing adjustment process. Secondly, the threshold function and attenuation function are proposed to quantify the emotional changes. In the actual environment, the emotional state of the robot and external stimulus are also quantified as the transferring probability. Finally, the Gaussian cloud distribution is introduced to the Gross model to calculate the emotional transitional probabilities. The experimental results show that the model in human-computer interaction can effectively regulate the emotional states, and can significantly improve the humanoid and intelligent ability of the robot. This model is consistent with experimental and emulational significance of the psychology, and allows the robot to get rid of the mechanical emotional transfer process.
