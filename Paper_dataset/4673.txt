AB In the next generation of computing, Mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) will play a very important role in the Internet of Things (IoT). The MANET is a kind of wireless networks that are self-organizing and auto connected in a decentralized system. Every device in MANET can be moved freely from one location to another in any direction. They can create a network with their neighbors' smart devices and forward data to another device. The IoT-Cloud-MANET framework of smart devices is composed of IoT, cloud computing, and MANET. This framework can access and deliver cloud services to the MANET users through their smart devices in the IoT framework where all computations, data handling, and resource management are performed. The smart devices can move from one location to another within the range of the MANET network. Various MANETs can connect to the same cloud, they can use cloud service in a real time. For connecting the smart device of MANET to cloud needs integration with mobile apps. My main contribution in this research links a new methodology for providing secure communication on the internet of smart devices using MANET Concept in 5G. The research methodology uses the correct and efficient simulation of the desired study and can be implemented in a framework of the Internet of Things in 5G.
