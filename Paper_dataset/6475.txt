AB Cloud computing is a new service to provide dynamic, scalable virtual resource services via the Internet. Cloud market is available to multiple cloud computing resource providers and users communicate with each other and participate in market transactions. However, since cloud computing is facing with more and more security issues, how to complete the allocation process effectively and securely become a problem urgently to be solved. In this paper, we firstly analyze the cloud resource allocation problem and propose a mathematic model based on combinatorial double auction. Secondly, we introduce a trust evaluation mechanism into our model and combine genetic algorithm with simulated annealing algorithm to increase the efficiency and security of cloud service. Finally, by doing the overall simulation, we prove that our model is highly effective in the allocation of cloud resources.
