AB In this paper we present an electronic voting system based on homomorphic encryption to ensure privacy, confidentiality and unicity in the voting. Our proposal offers all the advantages of Paillier additive homomorphic encryption cryptosystem and the huge public cloud resources; for some operations which request great mathematical calculations; to encrypt all the votes and perform the calculation of the election results without revealing any information about it, and the scheme is suitable for multi-candidate elections as well as for elections in which contains neutral votes. The proposed voting application provides secure voting.In addition, the complexity and the application execution time are analyzed and compared to other E-voting schemes
