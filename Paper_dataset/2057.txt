AB The rapid development of virtualization technology and cloud computing technology for the data center has brought the explosive growth of business volume and scale. The data center network is facing new challenges, such as ultra-high bandwidth requirements and energy-efficiency. The introduction of optical interconnect technology improves the performance of data center networks by virtue of less cost of devices, complexity, power consumption. However, there are still three major problems when adopting optical switching, which are constraint of centralized control system, non-modularity and poor scalability. Aiming at these problems, this letter proposes a MEMS-based N-dimensional modular hybrid data center network (MNDM) and corresponding MEMS scheduling strategy. We evaluate the performance of MNDM via OPNET simulation and results demonstrate that the MNDM architecture is stable in saturation point of latency and saturation point of throughput when the network size changes or network traffic changes.
