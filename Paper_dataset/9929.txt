AB Reputation systems are used for evaluating trustworthiness of the users based on their feedback (i.e., votes) about each other. Such systems are particularly important for cloud service providers, as they allow them to collect and aggregate feedback on the past behavior of users. Weighted-reputation aggregation is a protocol, where the vote server has a weight vector (W) over right arrow = {w(1); w(2); ... ; w(n)} for all voters, each voter has a vote score yi, and they cooperate to compute Sigma(n)(i=1) w(i)y(i). We call it ` privacy-friendly', if the respective inputs are kept private. In other words, a privacy-friendly weighted aggregation protocol is a secure evaluation for functionality pi(WV) : ((W) over right arrow; y(1); ... ; y(n)) bar right arrow (Sigma(n)(i=1) w(i)y(i);perpendicular to; ... perpendicular to). In this work, we propose two privacy-friendly weighted-reputation aggregation protocols: one in semi-honest model and another one in malicious model. The latter protocol uses the cryptographic primitives of homomorphic encryption, verifiable encryption, and the proof of knowledge of a discrete logarithm. Our protocols need only two rounds of communications, which is very efficient in practice. Our protocols are secure against the collusion of at most n - 2 malicious adversaries.
