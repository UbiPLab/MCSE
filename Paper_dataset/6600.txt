AB Cloud computing should inherently support various types of data-intensive workloads with different storage access patterns. This makes a high-performance storage system in the Cloud an important component. Emerging flash device technologies such as solid state drives (SSDs) are a viable choice for building high performance computing (HPC) cloud storage systems to address more fine-grained data access patterns. However, the bit-per-dollar SSD price is still higher than the prices of HDDs. This study proposes an optimized progressive file layout (PFL) method to leverage the advantages of SSDs in a parallel file system such as Lustre so that small file I/O performance can be significantly improved. A PFL can dynamically adjust chunk sizes and stripe patterns according to various I/O traffics. Extensive experimental results show that this approach (i.e. building a hybrid storage system based on a combination of SSDs and HDDs) can actually achieve balanced throughput over mixed I/O workloads consisting of large and small file access patterns.
