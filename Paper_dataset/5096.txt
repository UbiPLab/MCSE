AB In the past few years, cloud computing develops very quickly. A large amount of data are uploaded and stored in remote public cloud servers which cannot fully be trusted by users. Especially, more and more enterprises would like to manage their data by the aid of the cloud servers. However, when the data outsourced in the cloud are sensitive, the challenges of security and privacy becomes urgent for wide deployment of the cloud systems. This paper proposes a secure data sharing scheme to ensure the privacy of data owner and the security of the outsourced cloud data. The proposed scheme provides flexible utility of data while solving the privacy and security challenges for data sharing. The security and efficiency analysis demonstrate that the designed scheme is feasible and efficient. At last, we discuss its application in electronic health record.
