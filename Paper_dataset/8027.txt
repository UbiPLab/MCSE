AB Fog and mobile edge computing have gained considerable attention from the research and development community. The problems related to security and privacy of biometric content are simpler to solve through edge computing resulting in improved security and privacy of biometric and other critically private information. Zero-watermarking has been proposed as a solution to help protect the ownership of multimedia content that is easy to copy and distribute. Visual cryptography is another approach to secure data that is to be shared through generating multiple shares. This paper is concerned with developing a biometric security solution for face images, using visual cryptography and zero-watermarking, that does not adversely impact the visual quality of the image. The original face image is not modified through the zero-watermarking and visual encryption procedures and this in turn does not adversely impact the recognition rate.
