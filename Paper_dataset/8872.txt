AB To provide better overall performance, identity (ID)-based signcryption (IBSC) has been constructed by combining ID-based signature (IBS) and ID -based encryption (IBE) in a secure manner. Undoubtedly, the IBSC fulfills the authentication and the confidentiality by signature and encryption, respectively. All the previously proposed IBSC schemes are inseparable in the sense that the two-layer sign-then-encrypt procedure must be performed only by the same entity. However, the entities, such as wireless sensors and smart cards, are resource-constrained and become time consuming in executing the two-layer sign-then-encrypt procedure. Nowadays, the usage of mobile cloud computing is gaining expanding interest which provides scalable and virtualized services over the Internet or wireless networks while users with resource-constrained devices can enjoy the advantages of mobile cloud computing environments. Hence, we aim to reduce the computational cost for resource-constrained devices by employing a third party. In this article, we present the first separable ID -based signcryption (SIBSC) scheme in which the signing and encrypting layers are performed by the device and a third party, respectively. Under the computation Diffie-Hellman (CDH) and bilinear Diffie-Hellman (BDH) assumptions, we demonstrate that the proposed SIBSC scheme offers the provable security of authentication and confidentiality while retaining communication performance.
