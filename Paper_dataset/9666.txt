AB Designing dynamic pricing mechanisms that efficiently price resources in line with a provider's profit maximization goal is a key challenge in cloud computing environments. Despite the large volume of research published on this topic, there is no publicly available software system implementing dynamic pricing for Infrastructure as a Service cloud spot markets. This paper presents the implementation of a framework called Spot instance pricing as a Service (SipaaS) that supports an auction mechanism to price and allocate virtual machine instances. SipaaS is an open-source project offering a set of web services to price and sell virtual machine instances in a spot market resembling the Amazon EC2 spot instances. Cloud providers, who aim at utilizing SipaaS, should install add-ons in their existing platform to make use of the framework. As an instance, we provide an extension to the Horizon - the OpenStack dashboard project - to employ SipaaS web services and to add a spot market environment to OpenStack. To validate and evaluate the system, we conducted an experimental study with a group of 10 users utilizing the provided spot market in a real environment. Results show that the system performs reliably in a practical test environment. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
