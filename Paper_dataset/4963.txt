ID MUTUAL AUTHENTICATION; SCHEME; SECURE
AB Telecare medical information systems (TMIS) enable patients to access healthcare delivery services conveniently. With the explosive development occurring in cloud computing and services, storage of personal medical and health information outsourcing to cloud infrastructure has been a potential alternative. However, this has entailed many considerable security and privacy issues. In order to address the security loopholes, we propose a promising solution satisfying the requirements of cloud computing scenarios for telemedical systems. The proposed scheme could provide both data confidentiality and message authenticity while preserving anonymity. Furthermore, the formal security proof demonstrates that the proposed scheme is resistant to various attacks. The performance comparisons show the proposal's workability and it is well suited to adoption in telemedical services.
