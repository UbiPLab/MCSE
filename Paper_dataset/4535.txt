AB Cloud Manufacturing (CMfg), combining with the technologies of Cloud computing and Internet of Things, is an intelligent networked manufacturing model, which can quickly integrate various distributed manufacturing resources for collaboratively completing the complex and customized manufacturing tasks. One of the key technologies supporting this model is the optimal manufacturing resources in the CMfg systems, typically machine tools (MTs). In this paper, the attributes of MTs in cloud environment are analyzed, the constraint relationship between the attributes and the optimization criteria of MTs is established, and an optimization method of MTs based on rough set is proposed. Finally, a case study is discussed to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.
