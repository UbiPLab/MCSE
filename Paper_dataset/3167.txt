AB In this paper, we describe several linearized radiative transfer models which can be used for the retrieval of cloud parameters from EPIC (Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera) measurements. The approaches under examination are (1) the linearized forward approach, represented in this paper by the linearized discrete ordinate and matrix operator methods with matrix exponential, and (2) the forward-adjoint approach based on the discrete ordinate method with matrix exponential. To enhance the performance of the radiative transfer computations, the correlated k-distribution method and the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique are used. We provide a compact description of the proposed methods, as well as a numerical analysis of their accuracy and efficiency when simulating EPIC measurements in the oxygen A-band channel at 764 nm. We found that the computation time of the forward-adjoint approach using the correlated k-distribution method in conjunction with PCA is approximately 13 s for simultaneously computing the derivatives with respect to cloud optical thickness and cloud top height.
