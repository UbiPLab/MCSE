AB These days, Thin-client devices are continuously accessing the Internet to perform/receive diversity of services in the cloud. However these devices might either has lack in their capacity (e.g., processing, CPU, memory, storage, battery, resource allocation, etc) or in their network resources which is not sufficient to meet users satisfaction in using Thin-client services. Furthermore, transferring big size of Big Data over the network to centralized server might burden the network, cause poor quality of services, cause long respond delay, and inefficient use of network resources. To solve this issue, Thinclient devices such as smart mobile device should be connected to edge computing which is a localized near to user location and more powerful to perform computing or network resources. In this paper, we introduce a new method that constructs its architecture on Thin-client -edge computing collaboration. Furthermore, present our new strategy for optimizing big data distribution in cloud computing. Moreover, we propose algorithm to allocate resources to meet Service Level Agreement (SLA) and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Our simulation result shows that our proposed approach can improve resource allocation efficiently and shows better performance than other existing methods.
