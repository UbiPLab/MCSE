AB Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud providers hide available interfaces for virtual machine (VM) placement and migration, CPU capping, memory ballooning, page sharing, and I/O throttling, limiting the ways in which applications can optimally configure resources or respond to dynamically shifting workloads. Given these interfaces, applications could migrate VMs in response to diurnal workloads or changing prices, adjust resources in response to load changes, and so on. This article proposes a new abstraction that we call a Library Cloud and that allows users to customize the diverse available cloud resources to best serve their applications.
   We built a prototype of a Library Cloud that we call the Supercloud. The Supercloud encapsulates applications in a virtual cloud under users' full control and can incorporate one or more availability zones within a cloud provider or across different providers. The Supercloud provides virtual machine, storage, and networking complete with a full set of management operations, allowing applications to optimize performance. In this article, we demonstrate various innovations enabled by the Library Cloud.
