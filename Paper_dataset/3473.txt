AB In order to solve the problem of long path and long time of addressing the resource scheduling in virtual desktop cloud experiment, we improve the application of ant colony algorithm on the virtual cloud dynamic scheduling problem, which aims at shortening the addressing path and access time. An improved ant colony algorithm cross scheduling strategy is proposed by combining with the restraint function to establish a virtual cloud resource scheduling model so that it can reduce the scheduling time of the resource task being scheduled by the virtual machine. By using the strategy of iterative dynamic programming method to calculate and then combine with the ant colony algorithm, it not only can shorten the addressing time but can enhance the capacity so that it can shorten addressing path length immediately compared with the original ant colony algorithm on scheduling problem. the algorithm has obviously improved a lot on the efficiency of cross scheduling in the cloud resources. The experimental results show that the improved ant colony algorithm has the obvious convergence effects on the path and efficiency of the virtual task resource scheduling.
