AB Digital government in Europe is evolving rapidly, thanks to both advances in technology and the tendency for governments to establish more participative relationships with businesses and citizens. There is a drive to promote economic growth in digital businesses through the better use of data, and location data play a very important role in this. INSPIRE has created a basis for the harmonisation of location information across Europe, and is able to support some of the more important developments in digital government. Some Member States have developed integrated strategies and have provided lessons from which others may learn. Technological advances have created an immense range of opportunities through developments such as the internet of things, cloud computing and big data; however, they have also introduced challenges in terms of privacy, trust and the need for new digital skills. A workshop entitled "New Directions in Digital Government using INSPIRE" at the INSPIRE Conference 2017 aimed to explore these new directions by sharing experiences and ideas. This formed part of the ISA(2) work programme, undertaken by the European Location Interoperability Solutions for e-Government (ELISE) project, which involves the development of frameworks and solutions to exploit the potential of location information in digital public services across Europe.
