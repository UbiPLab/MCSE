AB Nowadays, the access to a cloud computing environment is provided on-demand, offering transparent services to clients. Although the cloud allows an abstraction of the behavior of the infrastructure in the service providers (involving logical and physical resources), the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) fulfilment remain a challenge, because depending on the service demand and the system configuration, the providers may not be able to meet the clients requirements. In this way, mechanisms that take account of load balancing and resource provisioning algorithms to provide an efficient load distribution in the available resources are necessary. However, the studies in the literature do not effectively address the problem of the resource provisioning to meet clients requirements using optimization techniques, restricting the analysis to a limited set of objectives. This paper proposes algorithms to address the computational resource provisioning problem using optimization techniques on-the-fly. The techniques optimize the use of the resources available in the cloud infrastructure, aiming to fulfill the clients requirements defined in the SLAs, and ensuring the efficient use of resources.
