AB eScience demands large-scale computing clusters to support the efficient execution of resource-intensive scientific applications. Virtual Machines (VMs) have introduced the ability to provide customizable execution environments, at the expense of performance loss for applications. However, in recent years, containers have emerged as a light-weight virtualization technology compared to VMs. Indeed, the usage of containers for virtual clusters allows better performance for the applications and fast deployment of additional working nodes, for enhanced elasticity. This paper focuses on the deployment, configuration and management of Virtual Elastic computer Clusters (VEC) dedicated to process scientific workloads. The nodes of the scientific cluster are hosted in containers running on bare-metal machines. The open source tool Elastic Cluster for Docker (EC4Docker) is introduced, integrated with Docker Swarm to create auto-scaled virtual computer clusters of containers across distributed deployments. We also discuss the benefits and limitations of this solution and analyse the performance of the developed tools under a real scenario by means of a scientific use case that demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed approach.
