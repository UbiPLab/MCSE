AB The energy consumption of the high energy consuming petroleum equipment in oil field possesses a high proportion in the total energy consumption of oil industry, so these equipment act as an important role in oil field energy saving. This paper analyzes the energy consumption constitutions in different production process. It is based on the study focusing on the running state and energy saving countermeasure of the high energy consuming mechanical equipment. The research is organized by the Chinese Academy of Engineering. The high energy consumption cause is studied by investigating and analyzing the running state of the principle energy consuming equipment in oil field and the design and manufacture level of the key large equipment in cloud computing. This thesis provides concurrent data processing model for shortening the production cycle and the fuzzy weighting subspace clustering algorithm to implement the equipment comparability, applying the big data on the running status statistics and applying cloud computation analysis on the corresponding energy saving countermeasure. The proposed approach is providing the method of eliminating equipment and the advice of the research directions in order to address the energy saving counter measure issues. The findings of this paper can be referenced as the energy saving counter measure in the petroleum industry. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
