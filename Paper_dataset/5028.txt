ID SOFTWARE-DEFINED NETWORKING
AB With the development of cloud computing technology and the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) terminals, more and more scenes need the collaboration of virtualmachines and IoT terminals to resolve. However, there aremany severe challenges on the security of virtual machines and IoT terminals. Based on Bell-LaPadula Model (BLP), a task-oriented multilevel cooperative access control scheme virtualization and reality BLP, named VR-BLP, is proposed. Specifically, tasks are created for each user of the platform and tasks and users are divided intomultiple levels to providemore granularities to limit access between virtualmachines and IoT terminals. Moreover, with network isolation cooperating with process isolation and sharedmemory isolationmechanisms, VR-BLP is implemented to enhance the security isolations between tasks. Performance evaluations show that VR-BLP enhanced the security of environment with virtualization and IoT without causing significant performance penalty.
