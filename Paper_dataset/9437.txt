AB Forensic investigation in cloud computing systems faces various legal, technical and organizational challenges. In this work, we focus on the technical issues of cloud forensics, specifically event correlation-a technique used to expose the relation between two or more cloud events. Event correlation in cloud is relatively at its early stages. We categorize the cloud event correlation in to two stages. In the first stage, we consider the events from the perspective of single artifact and perform correlation (homogeneous correlation). In the second stage, we collect the events from multiple artifacts and then perform correlation (heterogeneous correlation). The proposed approach helps automate the detection of incidents from cloud evidences and also speedup the event interpretation process by the investigator.
