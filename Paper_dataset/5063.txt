AB Nowadays research is heading towards the integration of cloud computing and Internet of Things thus creating a Cloud of Things (CoT). This combination generates a new paradigm for pervasive and ubiquitous computing. However, reliable CoT-based services, particularly, highly delay-sensitive services, such as, healthcare, require energy-efficient CoT architectures. Considerable efforts have been proposed to improve the efficiency of CoT architectures. This paper analyses CoT architectures and platforms, as well as the implementation of CoT in the context of smart healthcare. Subsequently, the paper explains some related issues of CoT, including the lack of standardization. Moreover, it focuses on energy efficiency with an in depth analysis of the most relevant proposals available in the literature. An evaluation of all the energy efficiency solutions investigated in this paper shows there is still a need to improve energy efficiency, especially regarding QoS and performance.
