AB The rapid advancement in communication technological innovations results in proliferation of heterogeneous smart devices in the network. The inter-communication of these devices is usually related to their social behaviour and relationships. Furthermore, upcoming 5G network promises to bind all the network technologies like Internet of Vehicles (IoV), Internet of Things (IoT), Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC), Smart Grids (SG), Big Data, and Device-to-Device (D2D) communications in a common network. To achieve this unified goal, one promising possibility is to exploit social properties of various smart devices used by these technologies. Exploitation of social aspect can dispense optimized networking while avoiding problems like, network congestion, resource allocations, and the like. It also leads to convergence of upcoming 5G network technologies and human society giving rise to a new paradigm known as "socio-5G network technologies". The state-of-the-art research on socio-5G network technologies is reviewed with the focus on six important technologies that 5G promises to support in one integrated network: IoV, IoT, MCC, SG, Big Data, and D2D communications. We also discuss the open issues related to combining social aspect with above-mentioned technologies.
