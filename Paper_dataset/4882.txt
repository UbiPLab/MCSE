AB Cloud radio access network (C-RAN) has become one of the hot-spot research directions in both industry and academia to facilitate 5G development. Its architecture is mainly divided into three parts: 1) Virtual base station (VBS) pool including a number of base band units that apply for real-time cloud computing technology to carry out digital processing tasks; 2) Remote radio heads (RRH) that are used to collect the wireless signals from all wireless devices; 3) Front-haul network connecting the RRH to the VBS pool. The information of base stations (BS) resides in a centralized VBS pool, multiple operators can allow their VBS pools to exchange control data and cooperate with each other to provide high-quality 5G services. In this process, trustworthy cooperation and platform-trust authentication among multiple mobile operators are required to realize high networking performance and secure 5G environment. However, this topic has been scarcely studies and is still in its infancy. In this paper, we first propose a C-RAN inter-operator cooperation scheme (IOCS) to support the cooperation of multiple operators in C-RAN and allow them to share resources in a trustworthy and secure way based on trusted computing platform. An access trust management pool including VBS trust managers is set up in IOCS to administrate an operator's VBS pool. It allows an end user to consume other operators' network resources in a trustworthy manner when its own operator's network cannot satisfy the quality of service requirements. Furthermore, we design a trusted cooperative platform based on OpenStack to implement IOCS. Performance evaluation and simulation results illustrate the high operation efficiency in IOCS comparing with other schemes. Game theoretical analysis shows the condition of inter-operator cooperation by taking operator trust into concern.
