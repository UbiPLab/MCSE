AB Cyber-physical systems allow to implement efficient, highly automated, and green smart industrial environments. To this aim, computation is a critical asset to control machineries, process data, and run proper optimization strategies. In general, computing capabilities are provided by virtualizing resources of local devices or servers deployed in a remote datacenter. Thus, their management is crucial for the security of the cyber-physical ecosystem or to engineer dependable industrial environments. In this article, we introduce a placement mechanism to pursue various security and dependability goals, such as preventing information leakages, providing redundancy, counteracting hardware outages or software aging, avoiding privacy breaks, and mitigating wastage of resources and energy. Multiobjective placement actions are computed by solving suitable mathematical programming problems with competing objectives. Simulations performed using real workload traces showcase the effectiveness of the approach in comparison with bin-packing-based heuristics.
