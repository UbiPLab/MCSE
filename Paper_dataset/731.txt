AB With the high popularity of IoT devices, industrial IoT platforms, such as smart factories and oilfield industrial control systems, have become a new trend in the development of smart city. Although various manufacturers pay wide attention to the different functional requirements of IoT platforms, they seldom consider security issues, especially in terms of data security, which has led to a large number of cases of privacy leakage. Some works have been made to provide secure and reliable communication solutions for industrial IoT platforms, unfortunately, as different communication protocols and interaction models are adopted in different scenarios, these solutions are mainly isolated and fragmented. Therefore, it is an urgent challenge to construct a universal cross-platform secure communication scheme for industrial IoT platforms. In this article, we analyze the logic and requirements of different industrial IoT scenarios to abstracts them into a universal model. We summarize the possible attacks on different industrial IoT platforms and design a security scheme to capture these attacks based on the conditional proxy re-encryption primitive. The proposed scheme ensures that data cannot be accessed by an unauthorized user. We also evaluate the security and performance of our scheme, and the experimental results show that our scheme can achieve the functionality and security requirements with low overhead.
