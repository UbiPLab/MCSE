AB Mobile edge computing (MEC) systems provide mobile devices (MDs) with low-latency cloud services by deploying edge servers (ESs) in the vicinity. In fact, various mobile applications may generate cotasks, each of which is completed only if all its constituent tasks are finished. Existing works have been devoted to the design of MEC offloading and scheduling, but none of them exploits the cotask feature to better utilize the networked computing resources. In this paper, we investigate the problem of joint cotask-aware offloading and scheduling in MEC systems (Cool-Edge), and we formulate it as a mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP), the objective of which is to minimize average cotask completion time (ACCT). To cope with the Cool-Edge problem, we propose two low-complexity algorithms to offload cotasks based on an LP rounding technique and schedule them according to an earliest-cotask-arrival-first rule, respectively, and we further prove the approximation factor jointly achieved by the two algorithms. Finally, we conduct testbed experiments and simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution, and we also show how ACCT varies with the network environment.
