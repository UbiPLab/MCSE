AB The first-level package that contains the IBM POWER9 processor chip is designed to achieve the high computational performance needed for cognitive systems in a cost-effective design. The throughput data bandwidth of the POWER9 package for high-end scale-up systems is more than 1 TB/s, which is double the data bandwidth of the previous generation. This increase in bandwidth is achieved by introducing a dielectric with a loss tangent of 40% of the predecessor material, a C4 density increase of 15%, higher number of stacked vias to reduce jogging, and improved via pattern and placement to increase the frequency and density of signals. The cloud platform scale-out POWER9 package leverages the high-end and cognitive platform package attributes to maintain signal frequency while introducing novel chip-package-system co-design techniques. These design techniques were used to produce a well-balanced two-socket entry-level package with four build-up layers above and below the core, instead of six, resulting in a significant cost reduction from the previous generation while supporting the signal frequencies of POWER9. POWER9 systems are the first to offer 16-Gb/s PCIe Gen4 and 25.8-Gb/s open coherent accelerator processor interface that interconnect the processor to the I/O, networking, and accelerators required for systems in the cognitive computing era. In this paper, we present the material and wiring technology needed to achieve the signal performance up to 25.8 Gb/s per channel, the package physical attributes, and the chip-package-system co-design methodology to achieve the increased signal density, minimize the crosstalk, and maximize the frequency while reusing the package form factors of the previous generation, IBM POWER8.
