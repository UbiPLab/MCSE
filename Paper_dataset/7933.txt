DE Cache partition; Fairness; Elastic cloud
AB When renting computing power, fairness and overall performance are important for customers and service providers. However, strict fairness usually results in poor performance. In this paper, we study this trade-off. In our experiments, equal cache partitioning results in 131 % higher miss ratios than optimal partitioning. In order to balance fairness and performance, we propose two elastic, or movable, cache allocation baselines: elastic miss ratio baseline (EMB) and elastic cache space baseline (ECB). Furthermore, we study optimal partitions for each baseline with different levels of elasticity, and show that EMB is more effective than ECB. We also classify programs from the SPEC 2006 benchmark suite based on how they benefit or suffer from the elastic baselines, and suggest essential information for customers and service provider to choose a baseline.
