AB The fast development of connected vehicles with support for various V2X (vehicle-to-everything) applications carries high demand for quality of edge services, which concerns microservice deployment and edge computing. We herein propose an efficient resource scheduling strategy to containerize microservice deployment for better performance. Firstly, we quantify three crucial factors (resource utilization, resource utilization balancing, and microservice dependencies) in resource scheduling. Then, we propose a multi-objective model to achieve equilibrium in these factors and a multiple fitness genetic algorithm (MFGA) for the balance between resource utilization, resource utilization balancing, and calling distance, where a container dynamic migration strategy in the crossover and mutation process of the algorithm is provided. The simulated results from Container-CloudSim showed the effectiveness of our MFGA.
