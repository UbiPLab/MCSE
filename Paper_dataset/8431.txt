AB Considering the issue of Chinese college students that are not interested in learning English and have a lack of enthusiasm for learning overall, a feedback and motivation application based on cloud computing to teach English vocabulary to Chinese college students has been developed. The mobile application can collect and analyze the problems that users encounter in the process of learning English through the cloud server in real-time, and advise on how to resolve these problems. The feedback system also allows users to access this data. In the case of uploading to designated teachers, teachers can adjust their teaching methods and means through the cloud server in real-time to maximize the quality of teaching and achieve the purpose of monitoring teaching. The system uses a cloud service teaching assistant system;therefore the teaching feedback incentive system is not limited by space, time or place, and is also easy to use. During the development of the mobile application, the difficulty of keeping students interested in learning languages is taken into consideration. Attention must be paid to the learning of English words, assisting in the phonetic training system, and the use of animation in stimulating students' interest in learning. The program can effectively improve students' interest in learning, and the feedback obtained from this method of teaching can also help teachers and students in the future.
