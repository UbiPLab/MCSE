AB This paper is an extended and updated version, presented at the INDIA 2017 conference. Optimal resource provisioning for virtual services in the Cloud computing is one of the concerns nowadays. For cloud computing service providers, reducing the number of physical machines providing resources for virtual services in cloud computing is one of the efficient ways to reduce the amount of energy consumption, which in turn enhances the performance of data centers. Multidimensional resource provisioning on a Heterogeneous Shared Hosting Platforms for virtual services is known as a NP-hard problem. Therefore, it is necessary to apply the metaheuristic algorithms for estimating the outcome of the problem. In this study, we propose the resource allocation problem for reducing the energy consumption. ECRA-SA algorithms were designed to solve it and were evaluated through CloudSim simulation tool compared with FFD algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed ECRA-SA algorithm yields a better performance than FFD algorithm.
