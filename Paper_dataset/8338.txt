ID SECURITY
AB With the prompt growth of distributed systems architectures, in particularly cloud computing, the authentication policy has becomes a crucial element for distributed communication. To ensure a secure access to data, numerous schemes have been designed to prevent listening, dictionary and intrusion attacks into stored password lists. These approaches remain relatively weak in terms of computer security; thus, they have defects on mutual authentication and they try to overcome their existing vulnerability.
   Our goal in this paper, is to enhance security in distributed systems, without affecting its performance. For this reason, we propose a new secure mutual authentication architecture for distributed systems, based on secure cryptographic primitives at the three communication entities involved (client, authentication server and n-servers of services), a consistent analysis regarding the complexity of our approach has been demonstrated with the BAN logic. It's composed of three main consists phases namely: 1)registration phase for secure exchange of authentication parameters, 2)communication phase aims to ensure mutual authentication of the three actors, based on secure cryptographic primitives and function (S2K ExS) for key generation and 3)renewal phase to update the authentication parameters.
