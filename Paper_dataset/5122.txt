DE Cloud Computing; Model-Driven Engineering; Unified Modeling Language
AB Cloud Computing and Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) are two of the most dominant paradigms nowadays. Models are considered as major parts in the MDE, and concentrates on the formation and then conversion of models to the implementation. Cloud Computing is also getting reputation as the standard approach for designing and organizing software applications over the internet, especially for distributed and e-commerce applications. In recent times, Cloud Computing has become known as a latest opportunity that how software and other resources can be provided to the consumers as a service. The cloud aspects need to be well engineered for the software engineering methodologies particularly modeling the cloud aspects to provide logical tested solution prior to implementation. On the other side, general-purpose language UML, provides modeling and designing notions to symbolize software, platforms and architectural artifacts from diverse viewpoints of object-oriented paradigm. UML can also be extended to model and visualize the non objectoriented systems. Lately, few cloud modeling methodologies have emerged, however, useful support for designing cloud application is still missing. As a result, we propose UML-based framework using UML extension mechanism for modeling cloud computing paradigm aspects.
