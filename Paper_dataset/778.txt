AB The recent spades of cyber attacks have compromised end-users' data security and privacy in Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS) in the era of Health 4.0. Traditional standard encryption algorithms for data protection are designed based on a viewpoint of system architecture rather than a viewpoint of end-users. As such encryption algorithms are transferring the protection on the data to the protection on the keys, data safety, and privacy will be compromised once the key is exposed. In this paper, we propose a secure data storage and sharing method consisted of a selective encryption algorithm combined with fragmentation and dispersion to protect the data safety and privacy even when both transmission media (e.g. cloud servers) and keys are compromised. This method is based on a user-centric design that protects the data on a trusted device such as the end-users' smartphone and lets the end-user control the access for data sharing. We also evaluate the performance of the algorithm on a smartphone platform to prove efficiency.
