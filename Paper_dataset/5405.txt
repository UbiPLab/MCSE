AB Information and communication technologies (ICT) can be instrumental in progressing towards smarter city environments, which improve city services, sustainability, and citizens' quality of life. Smart City software platforms can support the development and integration of Smart City applications. However, the ICT community must overcome current technological and scientific challenges before these platforms can be widely adopted. This article surveys the state of the art in software platforms for Smart Cities. We analyzed 23 projects concerning the most used enabling technologies, as well as functional and non-functional requirements, classifying them into four categories: Cyber-Physical Systems, Internet of Things, Big Data, and Cloud Computing. Based on these results, we derived a reference architecture to guide the development of next-generation software platforms for Smart Cities. Finally, we enumerated the most frequently cited open research challenges and discussed future opportunities. This survey provides important references to help application developers, city managers, system operators, end-users, and Smart City researchers make project, investment, and research decisions.
