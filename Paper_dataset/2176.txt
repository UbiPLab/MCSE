AB In preparation for all-sky satellite radiance assimilation, the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM), version 2.1.3, was used to produce Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-12/13 (GOES-12/13) imagery near 3.9 m. For the current study, model output simulated from different models, microphysics, and weather events was used by the CRTM to generate imagery over and near the United States. A direct comparison of observed and CRTM GOES-12/13 imagery near 3.9 m revealed that CRTM brightness temperatures of solid-water cold cloud tops were approximately 30 K less than observed values. Two CRTM errors were identified and resolved: 1) a coding error that was found by the CRTM team and 2) incorrect optical properties of ice, resulting in improved values of brightness temperatures. Further, changes in microphysics also contributed to improvements, save for one case. The coding error solution appeared in the publicly released CRTM, version 2.3.0, on 27 November 2017, while the inclusion of the optical property solution is undetermined. Since the CRTM is the radiative transfer model within the operational data assimilation system at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), improvements to both the CRTM and model microphysics will be beneficial for future all-sky radiance assimilation activities.
