AB With the development of cloud computing and widespread availability of mobile devices, outsourcing computation has gotten more and more attention in cloud computing services. The computation of bilinear pairing is the most expensive operation in pair-based cryptographic schemes. Currently, most of the algorithms for outsourcing bilinear pairing have small checkability or the outsourcers need to operate expensive computations. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for outsourcing bilinear pairing with two servers, where the outsourcers can detect the errors with a probability of 1 if the cloud servers are dishonest, and the outsourcers are not involved in any complex computations. Finally, the performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed algorithm is most efficient in all of fully verifiable outsourcing algorithms for bilinear pairing.
