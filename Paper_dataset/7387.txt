AB Delivering sensory data to users anytime and anywhere if there is network connection, sensor-cloud (SC), which integrates WSNs and cloud computing, is attracting growing interest from both academia and industry. This article discusses the potential applications and recent work about SC and observes two issues regarding green SC. Further, motivated by solving these two issues, this article proposes a Multi-Method Data Delivery (MMDD) scheme for SC users. MMDD strategically incorporates four kinds of delivery: delivery from cloud to SC users; delivery from WSN to SC users; delivery from SC users to SC users; and delivery from cloudlet to SC users. Compared to exclusive data delivery from cloud to SC users, evaluation results show that MMDD could achieve lower delivery cost or less delivery time for SC users.
