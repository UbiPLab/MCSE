AB Unreasonable resource allocation may shorten the service life of physical servers and affect the stability of the cloud data center. To solve this issue, a virtual machine (VM) allocation and placement strategy based on the types of applications is proposed. According to the strategy, appropriate VM is allocated based on the type of application. And the VM is placed on the server that the available resources is sufficient enough to support the application. Meanwhile, the load balance of the server is also considered when the VM is placed. Simulations on Cloudsim platform show that the performance of load balance of the VM placement strategy proposed is much better than that of the traditional VM placement strategy. And extensive experiments on cloudstack show that the VM placement strategy proposed is much more efficient than the traditional VM placement strategy in execution. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.
