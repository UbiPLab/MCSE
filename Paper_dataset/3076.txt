AB Cloud of Things (CoT) is an integration of Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing for intelligent and smart application especially in mobile environment. Model Driven Architecture (MDA) is used to develop Software as a Service (SaaS) so as to facilitate mobile application development by relieving developers from technical details. However, traditional service composition or mashup are somewhat unavailable due to complex relations and heterogeneous deployed environments. For the purpose of building cloud-enabled mobile applications in a configurable and adaptive way, Model-Driven Development Patterns based on semantic reasoning mechanism are provided towards CoT application development. Firstly, a meta-model covering both multi-view business elements and service components are provided for model transformation. Then, based on formal representation of models, three patterns from different tiers of Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework are used to transform business models into service component system so as to configure cloud services rapidly. Lastly, a related software platform is also provided for verification. The result shows that the platform is applicable for rapid system development by means of various service integration patterns.
