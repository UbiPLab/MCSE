AB Cloud Computing is a business model that based on "pay as you go" principle. It is used to provide the IT services to the user in the flexible and dynamic manner with minimal management effort. The most important feature of the Cloud Computing is the ability to dynamically schedule the application on the best resource according to the load. According to the work in this paper, a task schedule on the Cloud environment has been proposed. The principle of the proposed algorithm is to allocate the incoming task on the best resource during the runtime of some tasks based on measuring the current situation of each resource with respect to its availability level according to its processing power, cost, and the number of running tasks to know its fitness to receive the incoming task, then choosing the best one to the incoming task. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, a comparative study has been done between this proposed algorithm, Round Ribbon (RR) algorithm, and Minimum Completion Time (MCT) algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the RR, and MCT algorithms by reducing make-span and the cost of the running
