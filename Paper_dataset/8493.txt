AB We study the problem of the energy-efficient networking in cloud services with geographically distributed data centers for industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) networks, specially for multimedia IIoT networks. This is significantly challenged by dynamic end-to-end request demands and unbalanced link energy efficiency, unbalanced and time-varying link utilization, and bandwidth and delay constraints for service requirements. To solve these issues, we propose a multi-constraint optimization model for the energy efficiency optimization in cloud computing services where data centers are geographically distributed and are interconnected by cloud networks. Our model jointly optimizes energy efficiency in data centers and cloud networks. An intelligent heuristic algorithm is presented to solve this model for dynamic request demands between different data centers and between data centers and users. This is implemented by combining the niche genetic algorithm and the random depth-first search. Simulation results for energy-efficient networking show that better gains in network energy efficiency can be achieved by our joint optimization. Joint optimization between industrial data centers and industrial cloud networks can further improve energy savings and link utilization for time-varying requests.
