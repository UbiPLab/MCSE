AB An essential and practical application of cloud manufacturing is factory simulation as a cloud service (FSaaCS). In this paper, several topics related to implementing FSaaCS are discussed. Among them, load balancing is considered a critical topic. To address this topic, estimating a simulation workload is a crucial step. After factors critical to estimating a simulation workload were summarized, several methods were applied to estimate a simulation load, relevant to the required simulation time, from these factors. An experiment using real data was conducted to compare the performance of these methods. In addition, the paired test was performed and the results indicated that the performance of the fuzzy collaborative method is superior to those of some existing methods.
