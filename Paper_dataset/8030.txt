AB Fog computing, an extension of cloud computing services to the edge of the network to decrease latency and network congestion, is a relatively recent research trend. Although both cloud and fog offer similar resources and services, the latter is characterized by low latency with a wider spread and geographically distributed nodes to support mobility and real-time interaction. In this paper, we describe the fog computing architecture and review its different services and applications. We then discuss security and privacy issues in fog computing, focusing on service and resource availability. Virtualization is a vital technology in both fog and cloud computing that enables virtual machines (VMs) to coexist in a physical server (host) to share resources. These VMs could be subject to malicious attacks or the physical server hosting it could experience system failure, both of which result in unavailability of services and resources. Therefore, a conceptual smart pre-copy live migration approach is presented for VM migration. Using this approach, we can estimate the downtime after each iteration to determine whether to proceed to the stop-and-copy stage during a system failure or an attack on a fog computing node. This will minimize both the downtime and the migration time to guarantee resource and service availability to the end users of fog computing. Last, future research directions are outlined.
