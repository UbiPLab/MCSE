AB With the maturity of virtualization technology, cloud computing has brought us new computing and service models. Adopting a resource pool solution based on cloud computing architecture, the virtualized resources can be uniformly managed and deployed to achieve the purpose of automated and intelligent management of information systems. However, because cloud servers have some features that are different from ordinary hosts, existing intrusion detection technologies cannot be directly applied to cloud computing. This paper focuses on the real-time dispatching of people. The main innovation of this paper is to apply BP neural network technology to the real-time dispatching of intelligent people, establish the time prediction model of intelligent dispatching of people based on BP neural network, and design the intelligent dispatching algorithm of people based on BP neural network, and use examples to analyze the opposition to verify the feasibility of the algorithm. The results show that the algorithm improves the classification accuracy of neural networks and shortens the training time of samples. It improves the efficiency of intelligent dispatch detection, the accuracy of results and the efficiency of explicit algorithm.
