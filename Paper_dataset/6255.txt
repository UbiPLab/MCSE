AB The distributed and open structure of cloud computing and its services become an attractive target for potential cyber-attacks. The aim of using initially agents in the cloud is to exploit their speed of treatment and their negotiating process to choose the best resource for the Cloud subscriber. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a cooperative framework based on the concept of an artificial security administrator (ASA) to monitor and manage system incidents on behalf of a security human expert by bringing together the sense of analysis and learning ability of humans, moreover, the speed of computing and complexity management of multi-agent system.
