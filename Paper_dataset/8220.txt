ID MACHINE PLACEMENT OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHM
AB With greater numbers of cloud applications being deployed in virtual clusters (VCs) and running in datacenters, the energy consumption of datacenters is experiencing rapidly cumulative growth. Thus, it is a critical issue that how to allocate virtual machines (VMs) of the VC in physical machines (PMs) for energy savings as much as possible. Considering each PM/switch has a certain failure rate, VMs may not be executed when they meet with any PM/switch fault. So, a compact allocation scheme may benefit in low energy consumption but increase the risk of violating the availability of the VC. In this paper, we consider four optimization objectives about the VC and the datacenter, i.e., availability, energy consumption, average resource utilization, and resource load balance. Then we propose a multi-objective optimization model and raise an evolution algorithm to trade-off among these four optimization objectives. Finally, experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm.
