AB With the emergence of cloud-native applications, the question arises how existing, often monolithic, applications can be migrated to this new paradigm. The main migration challenges are the decomposition of an application into fine-grained components and the introduction of cloud computing paradigms. With complex existing applications the migration is difficult. A structured and tool-supported approach would facilitate the migration process, which is why this paper proposes a model-driven engineering based approach. As a basis, this paper derives and presents requirements for such an approach from the literature on the one hand and a migration case study on the other. The requirements are specifically targeted at the necessary models, but also consider the overall approach. The necessities for the realization of a model-driven cloud-native migration approach are shown and remaining challenges are discussed.
