AB Cloud computing is a technology that depends on the transfer of processing and storage space of the computer to the so-called cloud, a server that is accessed through the Internet, and thus turn IT programs from products to services. Thus, this technology contributes to the removal of the problems of maintenance and development of information technology programs on the companies used for them. Therefore, the efforts of the beneficiaries focus on using these services only. The cloud computing infrastructure relies on advanced data centers that provide large storage space for users and provides some software as services to users.
   This paper discuss and review deeply the cloud computing with its main structure, challenges and applications in different domains like education. The article concluded that cloud computing reflects a new paradigm for consumer IT services, supply and delivery where it provides computing processing power, storage, data transfer rate, software usage and development, testing, security and automation as services over the Internet. Also, it was shown that cloud computing provides users with the ability to use resources that exceed the capacity of their own devices, such as Internet applications and storage space, at lower prices than if they had purchased these resources. It gives anyone with Internet access the opportunity to use resources whenever they need them without having to install new software or buy new equipment. Cloud computing has emerged as a new and easy-to-use economic environment for all types of users, whether in business, education or even personal use.
