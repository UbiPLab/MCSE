DE Cloud computing; Standards; Interoperability; Federation
AB Technology market is continuing a rapid growth phase where different resource providers and Cloud Management Frameworks are positioning to provide ad-hoc solutions-as management interfaces, information discovery or billing-trying to differentiate from competitors resulting in incompatibilites between them when addressing more complex scenarios like federated clouds.
   Therefore, grasping interoperability problems present in current infrastructures by studying how existing and emerging standards could enhance the cloud user experience.
   In this paper we will review the current open challenges in Infrastructure as a Service cloud interoperability and federation, as well as point to the potential standards that should alleviate these problems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
