AB In cloud computing platform, current data scheduling algorithm cannot make full use of bandwidth resources of nodes in multi-core environment, resulting in heavy server load and play discontinuity of multimedia files, thus, a multimedia cloud computing platform data dynamic task scheduling method is proposed, on the basis of the related theory of multi-core processor, the system model and multimedia cloud computing platform data dynamic task model are established, multimedia cloud computing platform data dynamic task scheduling strategy is introduced based on the models, and gives assumed conditions of task scheduling strategy design, the priority calculation stage, improved particle swarm task scheduling stage and mapping stage from the task to processor are passed through to complete the analysis of this strategy, the tasks are distributed to the processor in accordance with certain rules, and dynamic task scheduling results are given and optimized. The simulation experimental results show that the proposed method has very high scheduling performance.
