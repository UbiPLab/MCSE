AB The emergence of the cloud computing technology has further enhanced the capabilities of the cloud-based virtual learning environment (VLE) compared to the grid computing based VLE as teaching resources can be accessed, saved, retrieved and shared on the cloud any time any where without any limitation. Unlike existing VLE literature that examines extrinsic motivation (e.g. TAM; UTAUT) from the perspective of the learners in the context of the conventional grid-computing VLE; this study examine the intrinsic motivation from the teachers' perspective in the context of the cloud-based VLE. So far, the influences of Self Determination Theory (i.e. relatedness, competence, autonomy) and Channel Expansion Theory (i.e. media richness) have been over-looked. In this study, the roles of SDT, CET, VLE content design and interactivity together with the trust-in-website, attitude toward knowledge sharing and school support are being examined. A sample of 1064 respondents was gathered using simple random sampling across the country and analyzed with PLS-SEM. The research model is able to predict intention to use with 65.96% variance explained. SDT, CET, VLE content design, Attitude toward knowledge sharing, trust-in-website, school support and education significantly effects intention to use VLE. This study provides theoretical and practical implications while contributing to the VLE literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
