AB Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is an emerging data collection paradigm that exploits the potential of individual mobile devices to acquire mass data in a cost-effective manner. One of the important challenges in MCS application is to resist malicious users who provide false data to disturb the system. In the existing work, the reputation management scheme is an effective way to overcome the challenge. However, most reputation management schemes rely on a semi-honest server and process data in the plaintext domain without considering server security and user privacy. In this paper, we integrate the blockchain and edge computing in the MCS scenario to construct a credible and efficient blockchain-based MCS system, called BC-MCS. To resist malicious users, we present a privacy-preserving reputation management scheme based on the proposed system. Furthermore, we design a delegation protocol to solve the inherent problem of user dynamics in the MCS. The prototype system implemented on the Hyperledger Sawtooth and Android client demonstrates that our scheme can achieve higher utility and security levels in handling malicious users compared with the previous centralized reputation management schemes.
