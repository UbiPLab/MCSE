AB With the increasing popularity of Cloud Computing and Internet of Things(IoT), Cloud computing among with the loT concept has become a hot research field in recent years. The ocean data information is more complex than the traditional data information. Based on the analysis of loT in marine field, this paper will establish a simplified model of Cloud Computing on marine loT and propose a ocean data processing algorithm. Specifically, different from traditional data processing algorithms, the proposed algorithm is based on the data of various sensors and cares deeply the effect of eliminating outliers and the smoothness of the processed curve. According to the processed data, we propose a mathematical model of route planning. In this model, the ship can arrive the destination line as soon and short distance as possible. Through analysis of experimental results by comparing the raw data and the processed data, it is shown that the proposed algorithm has a good optimization effect and the mathematical model is reasonable in actual measurement work.
