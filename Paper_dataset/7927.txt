AB This paper presents Lysis, which is a cloud-based platform for the deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The major features that have been followed in its design are the following: each object is an autonomous social agent; the platform as a service (PaaS) model is fully exploited; reusability at different layers is considered; the data is under control of the users. The first feature has been introduced by adopting the social IoT concept, according to which objects are capable of establishing social relationships in an autonomous way with respect to their owners with the benefits of improving the network scalability and information discovery efficiency. The major components of PaaS services are used for an easy management and development of applications by both users and programmers. The reusability allows the programmers to generate templates of objects and services available to the whole Lysis community. The data generated by the devices is stored at the object owners cloud spaces. This paper also presents a use-case that illustrates the implementation choices and the use of the Lysis features.
