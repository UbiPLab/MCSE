AB 5G network will enable new future Internet of Services paradigms such as Anything as a Service, where devices, terminals, machines, also smart things and robots will become innovative tools that will produce and will use applications, services and data. However, the emerging applications in the context of the Internet of Everything introduce high mobility, high scalability, real-time, and low latency requirements that raise new challenges on the services being provided to the users. Fortunately, Fog Computing or briefly Fog, which extends Cloud Computing to the edge of the network, with its service orchestration mechanisms offers virtually unlimited dynamic resources for computation, storage and service provision, that will effectively cope with the requirements of the forthcoming services. 5G in the fog computing environment will create opportunities for companies to deploy many new real-time services that cannot be delivered over current mobile and wireless networks. This paper evaluates fog computing service orchestration mechanisms in 5G network in terms of throughput, round trip time latency and the product latency - throughput.
