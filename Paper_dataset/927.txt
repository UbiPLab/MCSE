   Personal Information Protection Act
ID MODEL
AB This article uses Information technology (IT) to assist in the fulfillment of personal information protection and reduce IT risks within an organization. Advanced IT approaches are adopted to locate and verify personal information. Whenever the Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) is violated unnoticeably by users, the proposed system will effectively detect files with personal information by means of cloud computing and alert those users. This study uses Hadoop distributed computing platform to support computation of huge amount of data. To avoid the risk of information leakage when duplicating personal information to worker nodes in Hadoop cloud platform, personal information is hashed before transmission. To detect personal information, documents are analyzed using automata-based programming to locate suspicious words. Every suspicious word is then verified with the help of a personal information database. Finally, this study analyzes the computing efficiency of Hadoop nodes and experimentally shows how to adjust the number of maps in each node of the Hadoop MapReduce structure to optimize system performance.
