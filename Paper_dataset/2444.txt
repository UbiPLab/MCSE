AB Cloud computing emerges as a change in the business paradigm that offers pay-as-you-go computing capability and brings enormous benefits, but there are numerous organizations showing hesitation for the adoption of cloud computing due to security concerns. Remote attestation has been proven to boost confidence in clouds to guarantee hosted cloud applications' integrity. However, the state-of-the-art attestation schemes do not fit that multiple requesters raise their challenges simultaneously, thereby leading to larger performance overheads on the attester side. To address that, we propose an efficient and trustworthy concurrent attestation architecture under multi-requester scenarios, Astrape, to improve efficiency in the integrity and confidentiality protection aspects to generate an unforgeable and encrypted attestation report. Specifically, we propose two key techniques in this paper. The first one-aggregated attestation signature-reliably protects the attestation content from being compromised even in the presence of adversaries who have full control of the network, therefore successfully providing attestation integrity. The second one-delegation-based controlled reportintroduces a third-party service to distribute the attestation report to requesters in order to save computation and communication overload on the attested party. The report is encrypted with an access policy by using attribute-based encryption and accessed by a limited number of qualified requesters, hence supporting attestation confidentiality. The experimental results show that Astrape can take no more than 0.4 s to generate an unforgeable and encrypted report for 1000 requesters and deliver a throughput speedup of approximately 30x in comparison to the existing attestation systems.
