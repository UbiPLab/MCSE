DE FOG COMPUTING; IOT; MATCHMAKING; QOS AND SERVICE PROVIDER
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been the recent emerging fields of computing today. This technology is used in many applications such as health, banking and E-commerce. The Fog computing is mainly used with the cloud computing technology, end to end connection increases the efficiency for end users as well by reducing the workloads performed in the cloud computing. The fog computing research needs to be improved in various aspects to increase the efficiency like data transfer, security and Quality of Service(QoS). In this paper, we proposed a novel framework for fog computing model (FOG_QoS) incorporating the QoS parameters, to achieve better performance in Fog computing.
