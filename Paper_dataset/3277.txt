AB Nowadays, the total cost of cloud computing infrastructures for Web applications is calculated in deployment and production phases. Recently, the scientific community offers several methodologies to calculate the most suitable infrastructure at these stages to minimize its monetary costs while covering Service Level Agreement (SLA) constraints. On the other hand, Model Driven Web Engineering is taking advantages of code generation from Design level. With both concepts in the scene, in this work we show the first stage toward an approach to estimate the production costs in cloud computing infrastructures at Design phase, choosing the right infrastructure for the job. The process we have performed started defining the variables of the analysis, measuring the time needed in each different combination obtained, validating the confidence of results obtained and finally applying them to an illustrative example to exemplify the proposal in practical terms.
