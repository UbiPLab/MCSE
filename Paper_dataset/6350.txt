AB With the advent of the era of cloud computing, the high energy consumption of cloud computing data centers has become a prominent problem, and how to reduce the energy consumption of cloud computing data center and improve the efficiency of data center has become the research focus of researchers all the world. In a cloud environment, virtual machine consolidation (VMC) is an effective strategy that can improve the energy efficiency. However, at the same time, in the process of virtual machine consolidation, we need to deal with the tradeoff between energy consumption and excellent service performance to meet service level agreement (SLA). In this paper, we propose a new virtual machine consolidation framework for achieving better energy efficiency-Improved Underloaded Decision (IUD) algorithm and Minimum Average Utilization Difference (MAUD) algorithm. Finally, based on real workload data on PlanetLab, experiments have been done with the cloud simulation platform CloudSim. The experimental result shows that the proposed algorithm can reduce the energy consumption and SLA violation of data centers compared with existing algorithms, improving the energy efficiency of data centers.
