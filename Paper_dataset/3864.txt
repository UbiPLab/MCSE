ID SIDE-CHANNEL ATTACKS
AB In this paper, We present a new technique that offers lightweight, general, and elastic protection against Crum (Cross-VM runtime monitoring) attacks. Our protection, called Crease (CPU Resource Elasticity as a Service), enables a VM (called principal) to purchase a higher clock rate from the cloud, through lowering the frequency of a malicious VM (called peer), to support its security-critical operations within a short period. During that period, the weakened peer becomes unable to catch up with the pace of the strengthened principal, therefore losing the capability to effectively collect its sensitive information. In the meantime, our approach can also make up for the performance impact on the peer through refunding schedule credits or service credits, in line with the service level agreement of today's cloud. At the center of our design is the novel application of on-demand frequency scaling and schedule quantum randomization, together with a situation-awareness mechanism that dynamically assesses the security risk posed by the peer. We analyzed the security guarantee of our design, implemented a prototype and evaluated it on a well-known Crum attack (an LLC side-channel attack) and various workloads. Our study shows that Crease is effective at protecting the principal, with only a small impact on the peer's operations.
