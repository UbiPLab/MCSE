AB A substitute solution for various organizations of data owners to store their data in the cloud using storage as a service(SaaS). The outsourced sensitive data is encrypted before uploading into the cloud to achieve data privacy. The encrypted data is search based on keywords and retrieve interested files by data user using a lot of traditional Search scheme. Existing search schemes supports exact keyword match or fuzzy keyword search, but synonym based multi-keyword search are not supported. In the real world scenario, cloud users may not know the exact keyword for searching and they might give synonym of the keyword as the input for search instead of exact or fuzzy keyword due to lack of appropriate knowledge of data. In this paper, we describe an efficient search approach for encrypted data called as Split Keyword Fuzzy and Synonym Search (S K F S). Multi-keyword ranked search with accurate keyword and Fuzzy search supports synonym queries are a major contribution of SKFS. The wildcard Technique is used to store the keywords securely within the index tree. Index tree helps to search faster, accurate and low storage cost. Extensive experimental results on real-time data sets shows, the proposed solution is effective and efficient for multi-keyword ranked search and synonym queries Fuzzy based search over encrypted cloud data.
