AB Recent radio observations show that giant molecular cloud (GMC) mass functions noticeably vary across galactic disks. High-resolution magnetohydrodynamics simulations show that multiple episodes of compression are required for creating a molecular cloud in the magnetized interstellar medium. In this article, we formulate the evolution equation for the GMC mass function to reproduce the observed profiles, for which multiple compressions are driven by a network of expanding shells due to H II regions and supernova remnants. We introduce the cloudcloud collision (CCC) terms in the evolution equation in contrast to previous work (Inutsuka et al.). The computed time evolution suggests that the GMC mass function slope is governed by the ratio of GMC formation timescale to its dispersal timescale, and that the CCC effect is limited only in the massive end of the mass function. In addition, we identify a gas resurrection channel that allows the gas dispersed by massive stars to regenerate GMC populations or to accrete onto pre-existing GMCs. Our results show that almost all of the dispersed gas contributes to the mass growth of pre-existing GMCs in arm regions whereas less than 60% contributes in inter-arm regions. Our results also predict that GMC mass functions have a single power-law exponent in the mass range < 10(5.5) M-circle dot (where M-circle dot represents the solar mass), which is well characterized by GMC self-growth and dispersal timescales. Measurement of the GMC mass function slope provides a powerful method to constrain those GMC timescales and the gas resurrecting factor in various environments across galactic disks.
