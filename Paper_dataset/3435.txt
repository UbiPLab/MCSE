AB As a progressively accumulating and dynamically changing process, agricultural drought stress is influenced by various factors, such as atmospheric environment, hydrogeology and vegetation. To master the change laws of soil drought, we proposed a novel soil drought monitoring forecasting method based on Google cloud computing service platform. The Google cloud computing platform Google App Engine was analysed. This computing platform was utilized for drought monitoring. A three-layer back-propagation neural network was used for the forecasting analysis of corresponding soil drought. The accuracy of the method was verified through an experiment. Results demonstrate that all the relative errors of the method were lower than 10% and thus it has a high monitoring precision. These findings can be used as a theoretical basis for formulating strategies for drought resistance. The proposed method provides a good prospect to drought monitoring and forecasting strategies using other cloud computing platforms.
