AB Featured Application This work can be applied with the Requirements Engineering Process to elicit the security requirements for an information system's development. With recent advancements of technologies such as Internet of Things and cloud computing, security of information systems has emerged as a critical issue. This has created a need for elicitation and analysis of the security requirements at an early stage of system development. These requirements should also be expressed using visual notations that can encapsulate the vision of different stakeholders related to security. While business process management notation (version 2.0.2) is a widely used graphical representation for business requirements and makes it easier to define and communicate business processes between different stakeholders of the system. Moreover, extension mechanisms are available to model the specific needs of an organization. Due to its flexible structure for defining new extensions, it can be adapted to model security requirements in the information system (IS). Towards this, we propose a threat profile security framework to define the security requirements of manufacturing systems for businesses, which are at a stage of infancy to adapt or evolve the IS with the changing needs of a business environment. In particular, the framework is modeled by extending Business Process Management Notation and is applied in a manufacturing industry process at the shop floor level. We show through a case study example that the threat goal-based framework is broader and, hence, covers a majority of security concerns of organizations.
