AB Cloud computing provides users with a great deal of flexibility and convenience. However, cloud computing also brings very serious security problems, especially for enterprise data security stored in the cloud. Once the data is outsourced to a third party, the data privacy has become a major problem, such as user authentication, integrity of data etc. and needs to be addressed very effectively. A mutual authentication scheme based on smartcard for cloud computing is proposed to solve the problem of which the illegal users access the resource of cloud servers and the legal users access the illegal cloud server. The scheme achieves mutual authentication by using hash functions to protect user privacy. Performance comparison shows that the proposed scheme is an efficient one.
