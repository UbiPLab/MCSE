AB In this paper, a new technique is proposed to improve the data services in cloud computing by finding an available path by making an interoperation between the lower networks layer. The proposed technique enables layer 2&3 co-operation together to make path slowing detection and then the traffic will be re-routing via the mentioned path in less time between request and server receiver. The load balance and rerouting in less time lead to improve the services in the cloud computing network. The technique involves detecting many alternative path via each adjacencies node in the network topology. The rerouting for the requested service to the receiver server is required to create an algorithm to compute the utilization for each path after the routing protocol in IGP network constructs the routing table for network topology. In case of failure, the data packets do not need to wait for the routing protocol to update the routing table for the network topology. This is because the proposed technique will nominate other existing paths to the destination to pass the packet to the final destination. The proposed algorithm will convert the traffic via its available path with ensuring that there is no loop in the network until the routing protocol considers the updating information for all nodes in the topology. In the network, layer 2 has demonstrated its ability to detect the path failure in case loss of signal. It is extremely quickly through the immediate detection of the loss of light signals for the link or node. The mechanism switches the data packets through an adjacent node to its requested server in cloud network via the life node. The aim of this mechanism is to avoid loss of packets especially for real-time traffic and improve QoS.
