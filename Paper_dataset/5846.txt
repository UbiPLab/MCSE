AB Complexity of cloud infrastructures needs models and tools for process management, configuration, scaling, elastic computing and cloud resource health control. This paper presents a Smart Cloud Engine and solution based on a Knowledge Base, KB, with the aim of modeling cloud resources, Service Level Agreements and their evolutions, and enabling the reasoning on structures by implementing strategies of efficient smart cloud management and intelligence. The solution proposed provides formal verification and intelligence tools for cloud control. It can be easily integrated with a large range of cloud configuration manager, cloud orchestrator, and monitoring tools, since the connections with these tools are performed by using REST calls and XML files. The proposed solution has been validated in the context of large ICARO Cloud project and in the cloud facility of a national cloud service provider. Some data resulting from the validation phases have been reported and are referring to the dynamic management of real ECLAP social network http://www.eclap.eu. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.
