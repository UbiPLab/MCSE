AB Smart grid deploys large numbers of intelligent terminals, to monitor or control the operating status and improve the energy efficiency and functional applications. In this paper, we study the power efficiency problem of intelligent cell based on the power big data, and present the system architecture and key algorithm for the intelligent community and smart industrial park: 1) we propose a business intelligence architecture based on cloud computing to meet the requirements of efficient storage and analysis of massive data; 2) we also establish a multivariable, multi-dimensional intelligent electricity energy analysis model which improves the orderly power consumption efficiency; 3) also we present a novel parallel algorithm to achieve the data mining algorithms and data analysis algorithms, and solve the issue of processing speed of large-scale data analysis. The analysis results guided the efficient electricity, and increased the functions of the intelligent community and the intelligent life preliminarily.
