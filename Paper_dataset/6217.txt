AB The virtually unlimited available resources and wide range of services provided by the cloud have resulted in the emergence of new cloud-based applications, such as smart grids, smart building control, and virtual reality. These developments, however, have also been accompanied by a problem for delay-sensitive applications that have stringent delay requirements. The current cloud computing paradigm cannot realize the requirements of mobility support, location awareness, and low latency. Hence, to address the problem, an edge computing paradigm that aims to extend the cloud resources and services and enable them to be nearer the edge of an enterprise's network has been introduced. In this article, we highlight the significance of edge computing by providing real-life scenarios that have strict constraint requirements on application response time. From the previous literature, we devise a taxonomy to classify the current research efforts in the domain of edge computing. We also discuss the key requirements that enable edge computing. Finally, current challenges in realizing the vision of edge computing are discussed.
