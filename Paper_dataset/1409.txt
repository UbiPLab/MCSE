AB In the last decade, containers have become a superior alternative to hypervisor-based virtualization. Containerization has revolutionized data centers from being an infrastructure-oriented to be application oriented. Modern cloud consumption patterns such as flash crowds require a certain amount of elasticity that is realized with controlling the amount of provisioned resources autonomously. Cloud elasticity is significant as it influences the performance of utilized resources, service level commitment, and power consumption. In this paper, an infrastructure elasticity control algorithm for a containerized cloud is proposed. The proposed algorithm augments the load balancing criterion with elasticity control. Several experiments with various metrics are carried out to examine the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm and the effects of elasticity across various measures.
