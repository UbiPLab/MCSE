AB With the development of AI, cloud computing and 5G technology, new opportunities are opening up in the field of robotics. However, current robots are not closely tied to users. Because they provide homogeneous and popular services to all users, there is a lack of consideration for the individual diversity of users. Another defect of current robots is that they do not have the ability of migration and emotional perception for users. Therefore, an individualized follow me Robot-Mind-centered robot service system is proposed in this article. The follow me Robot-Mind can migrate at any time along with the user's geospatial movement, which allows it to continuously accompany and grow with the user. In addition to the follow me Robot-Mind and physical robot, the system also includes components like multi-functional intelligent clothing, the intelligent cloud and the 5G network. A variety of AI algorithms are deployed in the intelligent cloud, which guarantees the intelligence of the follow me Robot-Mind. Then based on the proposed system, a testbed is established and the experiment results show the advantages and effectiveness of the system. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
