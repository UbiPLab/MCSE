AB Privacy in online applications has drawn tremendous attention in recent years. With the development of cloud-based applications, protecting users' privacy while guaranteeing the expected service from the server has become a significant issue. This paper surveyed the most popular cryptographic algorithms in privacy-preserving online applications to provide a tutorial-like introduction to researchers in this area. Particularly, this paper focuses on introduction to homomorphic encryption, secret sharing, secure multi-party computation and zero-knowledge proof.
