AB Cloud computing has reached the peak of Gartner hype cycle, and now the focus of every industry is the ability to scale with minimal investment. Scalability comes with its own challenges of data privacy and secured communication, and one of the key privacy concern is caused by frequent changes in membership and multiple owner data sharing. To address secured data sharing, a new dual authentication protocol for secure transmission of data with two level of authentication along with precedence based access control List has been proposed. Proven Triple DES algorithm is used for data encryption, wherein data Owners can encrypt data using their Identity with additional security attributes and the encrypted data is stored in cloud. Only the users who satisfies the encrypted attributes can decrypt the original data, and users can be anonymous if theywant to be. Our proposed dual authentication protocol for multi-owner makes the system secured and robust and has been verified through multiple scenarios.
