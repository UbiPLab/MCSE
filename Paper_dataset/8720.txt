AB Cloud Computing is an expression that is currently used nowadays not only by Information Technology - IT engineers involved with IT infrastructure and applications but by every IT user. This article is devoted to give an explanation of this concept that is often used and listened but not always understood, although in fact all of us have surely benefited from cloud computing as it is simply about using services, applications and infrastructure residing on private or public networks such as Internet. In this order of ideas, the users don't access a known server equipment that is located at his home or in the facilities of his company or university, but one that can be anywhere in the world and has published the service or application either in the Internet or in a private network, so that users located anywhere in the world can used them with prior or without prior authorization.
