AB Cloud computing has emerged as one of the most important technological revolutions globally. However, the rapid growth of cloud computing has imposed a massive financial burden and resulted in environmental side effects due to excessive energy consumption. The high power consumption is not only attributed to the size of data centers but also to the ineptitude of resource usage. Most of the extant research has focused on reducing power consumption by an aggressive VM consolidation, which leads to the violation of the service level agreement (SLA). Furthermore, the unbalanced resource consumption exacerbates the unavailable wasted resources that are referred to as unavailable resource fragmentation. In this paper, we propose the use of a balanced resources consumption algorithm called BRC-IBMMT in order to enhance the efficiency of resource consumption while achieving an acceptable balance between conflicting correlation objectives of power consumption as well as SLA violation. The extensive simulation results of different types of workload validate and lend credence to the significance of the proposed method in reducing power consumption and SLA violation of the cloud data center.
