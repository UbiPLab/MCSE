AB The cloud is scalable and cost-efficient, but it isn't ideal for hosting all applications. Fog computing proposes an alternative of offloading some computation to the edge. Which applications to offload, where to send them, and when this should occur isn't entirely clear yet, due to a lack of understanding of potential edge infrastructures. Through a number of experiments, the authors showcase the feasibility and readiness of micro-clouds formed by collections of Raspberry Pis to host a range of fog applications, particularly for network-constrained environments.
