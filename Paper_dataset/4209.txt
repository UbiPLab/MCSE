AB Cloud computing has recently evolved into container technology and edge computing for conveniently hosting and delivering a set of services. There is a need to compose individual services to perform a complex task. However, finding an optimal solution of composition satisfying both functional and non-functional requirements is a challenging problem. To solve this problem, we propose a method using fuzzy analytical hierarchy process and an extended Dijkstra algorithm to find a solution in a directed bipartite graph stored in a Neo4j graph database. Unlike other database-based approaches that aim to optimize a pre-defined composition task, our approach is much flexible that can perform an arbitrary task once the services information is preprocessed in a database. We conduct experiments and compare the performance of the proposed approach with a Graphplan method and a relational database-based approach, and the results show that this approach leads to less query execution time and better user's satisfaction.
