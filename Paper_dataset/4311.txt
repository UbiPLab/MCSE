AB The capability of the data center network largely decides the performance of cloud computing. However, the number of servers in the data center network becomes increasingly huge, because of the continuous growth of the application requirements. The performance improvement of cloud computing faces great challenges of how to connect a large number of servers in building a data center network with promising performance. Traditional tree-based data center networks have issues of bandwidth bottleneck, failure of single switch, etc. Recently proposed data center networks such as DCell, FiConn, and BCube, have larger bandwidth and better fault-tolerance with respect to traditional tree-based data center networks. Nonetheless, for DCell and FiConn, the fault-tolerant length of path between servers increases in case of failure of switches; BCube requires higher performance in switches when its scale is enlarged. Based on the above considerations, we propose a new server-centric data center network, called BCDC, based on crossed cube with excellent performance. Then, we study the connectivity of BCDC networks. Furthermore, we propose communication algorithms and fault-tolerant routing algorithm of BCDC networks. Moreover, we analyze the performance and time complexities of the proposed algorithms in BCDC networks. Our research will provide the basis for design and implementation of a new family of data center networks.
