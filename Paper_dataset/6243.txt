AB The application of emerging technologies of Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing have increasing the, popularity of smart homes, along with which, large volumes of heterogeneous data have been generating by home entities. The representation, management and application of the continuously increasing amounts of heterogeneous, data in the smart home data space have been critical challenges to the further development of smart home industry. To this end, a scheme for ontology-based data semantic management and application is proposed in this paper. Based on a smart home system model abstracted from the perspective of implementing users' household operations, a general domain ontology model is designed by defining the correlative concepts, and a logical data semantic fusion model is designed accordingly. Subsequently, to achieve high-efficiency ontology data query and update in the implementation of the data semantic fusion model, a relational-database-based ontology data decomposition storage method is developed by thoroughly investigating existing storage modes, and the performance is demonstrated using a group of elaborated ontology data query and update operations. Comprehensively utilizing the stated achievements, ontology-based semantic reasoning with a specially designed semantic matching rule is studied as well in this work in an attempt to provide accurate and personalized home services, and the efficiency is demonstrated through experiments conducted on the developed testing system for user behavior reasoning.
