AB Cloud computing is profoundly changing the way of data storage, transfer and process. User authentication is the first security barrier for cloud computing. However, the security of traditional biometric-template-based authentication technology has been challenged because of the information leakage of biometric templates and insufficient user-key strength, which is limited by the ability of the user to memorize keys. In this paper, we propose a new bio-key generation algorithm named FVHS, which combines the advantages of both biometrics authentication and user-key authentication. It directly generates stable and sufficiently strong bio-key sequences from finger vein biometrics. Based on FVHS, a new framework for cloud computing authentication is presented that provides a more flexible, convenient, and secure user authentication. The key idea of FVHS is that through combining machine learning, biometrics, and cryptography technologies, we can mine a special feature vector from the biometrics space that can be separated and stabilized into a fixed number sequence in a higher-dimensional space. Both a theoretical analysis and experimental verification show that FVHS can extract stable bio-keys from high quality finger vein images. FVHS can extract a finger vein bio-key with a Genuine Accept Rate of more than 99.9%, while the False Accept Rate is less than 0.8% and Equal Error Rate is less than 0.5%. Meanwhile, the security strength can reach 256 bits. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
