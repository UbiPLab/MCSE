AB The move of computational genomics workflows to Cloud Computing platforms is associated with a new level of integration and interoperability that challenges existing data representation formats. The Variant Calling Format (VCF) is in a particularly sensitive position in that regard, with both clinical and consumer-facing analysis tools relying on this self-contained description of genomic variation in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) results. In this report we identify an isomorphic map between VCF and the reference Resource Description Framework. RDF is advanced by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to enable representations of linked data that are both distributed and discoverable. The resulting ability to decompose VCF reports of genomic variation without loss of context addresses the need to modularize and govern NGS pipelines for Precision Medicine. Specifically, it provides the flexibility (i.e. the indexing) needed to support the wide variety of clinical scenarios and patient-facing governance where only part of the VCF data is fitting.
