AB Using a 3D geographical information system (GIS) and cloud computing, a new government affairs service platform is presented. To manage arid use the city's data efficiently, the 3D analysis and visualization of the city's information are held on the platform of the smart city. With the new platform, a series of e-government services can be conducted to manage the makers and operation supervisors in the government agencies and other smart city industries, such as urban disaster and environmental protection, intelligent transportation, monitoring and evaluation of the urban resource centers. All services presented on the platform are extracted from the government departments' practical demand. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
