AB This research aims to develop a cloud-based safety information and communication system for improving safety performance of infrastructure projects. To achieve this aim, firstly, current traditional paper based construction safety management system and practice are described, together with a review of the potential application of cloud-based information technology in safety management. Secondly, a cloud-based safety information and communication system (named as MapSafe) was designed and developed by using a free-to-use online web server. The MapSafe system functions include Pre-Starting Safety Meeting Recording, Permit to Penetrate Request and Approval, Job Safety Analysis, and Safety Incident Reporting. The system was tested by using a road construction project and the results show it is a robust system that can be applied to improve safety. The key contribution of this research includes mapping the processes of safety information collection, analysis and approval, and pointing out the way for future application of cloud computing in construction safety management.
