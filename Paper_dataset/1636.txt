AB To strengthen the security of access control protocols for mobile cloud environment, dynamic attributes of mobile devices are used. The weak or disconnection issue of the mobile network is a critical task to deal with. The proposed approach provides access control as well as data confidentiality using dynamic attributes encryption. The pairs of mobile agents are used to deal with the issue of network connection. The secret key is distributed using the anonymous key-issuing protocol which preserves the anonymity of the user. The approach is implemented in a real mobile cloud environment, and the performance under various parameters is evaluated. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
