AB Reliability Block Diagrams (RBDs) allow us to model the failure relationships of complex systems and their sub-components and are extensively used for system reliability, availability and maintainability analyses. Traditionally, these RBD-based analyses are done using paper-and-pencil proofs or computer simulations, which cannot ascertain absolute correctness due to their inaccuracy limitations. As a complementary approach, we propose to use the higher-order logic theorem prover HOL to conduct RBD-based analysis. For this purpose, we present a higher order logic formalization of commonly used RBD configurations, such as series, parallel, parallel-series and series-parallel, and the formal verification of their equivalent mathematical expressions. A distinguishing feature of the proposed RBD formalization is the ability to model nested RBD configurations, which are RBDs having blocks that also represent RBD configurations. This generality allows us to formally analyze the reliability of many real-world systems. For illustration purposes, we formally analyze the reliability of a generic Virtual Data Center (VDC) in a cloud computing infrastructure exhibiting the nested series-parallel RBD configuration.
