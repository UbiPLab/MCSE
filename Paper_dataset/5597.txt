AB A newly calculated ab initio potential energy surface is used to compute collision-driven state-changing cross sections and rate coefficients over a range from 5 to 100 K for CN-((1)sigma), the smallest anion detected in the interstellar medium, interacting with He, an abundant species in this environment. We compare our presently computed rate coefficients with those previously published for the similar and important systems CN-He, CN-H-2, and CN--H(2)to illustrate the broader network of inelastic, state-changing processes for these four systems. We also discuss the size-scaling effects that occur when changing partners from He to H-2. We further analyze the differences in size between collision-driven rate coefficients when going from neutral CN to its anion. All the present results are discussed in detail, to provide accurate and realistic data for chemical networks that wish to include the CN(-)anion in their modeling of astrochemical environments.
