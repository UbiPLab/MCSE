AB As the phenomenon of convergence in the field of information and communication technology (ICT) and services is accelerated with the development of science and technology, the ecosystem of the ICT industry is gradually evolving into an open ecosystem. This study analyzes the strategic alliance mechanism in the ICT industry, taking the view that active strategic alliances should be pursued for co-evolution between the companies in an open ecosystem. Based on previous studies and expert opinions, the objectives of a strategic alliance are classified into main evaluation categories such as strategy-oriented, cost-oriented, resource-oriented and learning-oriented, and the detailed subcategories are presented. Through an analysis of the ecosystem of the ICT industry, multimedia contents (production, distribution), platform (cloud computing, mobile cloud computing), network (wired network, wireless network), device (home electronics, mobile) are identified as the agents to be analyzed. By applying the analytic network process (ANP) based on the above, the priority of the objectives of strategic alliances in the ICT industry is determined by the agent. This study is expected to promote the development of a business model and co-opetition between the companies to create sustainable competitive advantages in the future open ecosystem, and to contribute to the creation of corporate and national profits.
