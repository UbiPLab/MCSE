AB Plants play a vital role in current scenario. Identification of plants, leaves, stems and finding out the pest or diseases, percentage of the pest or disease incidence, symptoms of the pest or disease attack, plays a key role in successful cultivation of crops. The main disease of plants is viral, fungal and bacterial. Automatic detection of plant diseases is an important research topic as it may prove benefits in monitoring large field of crops, and thus automatically detect diseases from symptoms that appear on plant leaves. This paper mainly concentrates on the detection of disease in leaves using image processing technique. The affected leaves mainly show variation in color, texture and shape. Using these parameters for feature extraction the database is created with 18 parameters. Classification is done by Support Vector Mchine (SVM) the background and the leaves are separated using multi layer perceptron neural network. The samples are tested with test image and the output displays the affected leaf with the accuracy and the disease present in it. Later the database is stored in Raspberry pi processor for real time detection. Raspberry pi uses Raspbian Wolfram Mathematica software where Mathematica is the programming tool. In order to make the system a real time application oriented cloud computing is used.
