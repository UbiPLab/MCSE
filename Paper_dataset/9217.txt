AB With the rapid development in information technologies, numerous Virtual laboratory (VL) studies are being conducted in various fields such as material science, computer science, chemistry and education. While the number of VL studies are rising, possible interactions between these VLs have not been studied yet. The aim of this study is to create a framework in order to gather all VLs in a common base by building interactions between VLs via a multi-agent system (MAS) approach. Cloud-Based Integrated Virtual Laboratories (CIVIL) model has been proposed as a conceptual framework of collaborative networks of a cloud system with the help of MAS. The boundaries of the integrated problem are determined and schematized within the scope of conceptual modeling. Thereafter probable entities that may interact in the framework are included in the MAS model. Communications and interactions between these entities, aims and performance indicators of defined agents are also listed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
