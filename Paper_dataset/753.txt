AB The rapid growth of industry and transport within this contemporary progress, there was sufficient con-sideration given to air quality monitoring; but conventional air quality monitoring methods are inefficient to produce adequate spatial and temporal resolutions of the air quality information by cost-effective also the period time clarifications. During the paper, we propose a distinct methodology to achieve the air quality monitoring system, using this fog computing-based Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper pro-posed an embedded system, where sensors collect the air quality information within period time and send it over the fog nodes. Every fog node may be an extraordinarily virtualized program hosted at a committed computing node implemented with a connection interface. Data gathered by Microprocessor based IoT sensing things do not seem to be causing on into the cloud server to the process. Preferably, they do send through the adjacent fog node to get quick, including high-rise rate service. Though, fog node will refine non-actionable data (e.g., regular device measurement) also forward them to the Cloud for lengthy run storage and batch analytics. The Cloud may be a convenient location to run world an-alytics at information gathered from commonly shared devices over sustained periods (months, years). General purpose processor (microprocessor) and IoT cloud platforms were involved in developing this whole infrastructure and model for analysis. Empirical outcomes reveal that this advanced method is re-sponsible for sensing air quality, which serves to expose the modification patterns regarding air quality through a certain level.
