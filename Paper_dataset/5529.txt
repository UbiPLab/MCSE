AB Internet of Things (IoT) has become a new paradigm of communication to reform traditional industries, in which distributed data automatically collected via IoT in a low cost enables many new IT services that were even impossible decades ago. This research reports on an IoT-enabled production management service for crude-oil industry. In practice, even if an optimal management decision is achieved, disruptions, such as possible oil-device failures, inclement weathers and other disturbances, arise frequently and then weaken efficiency and stability of supplement. With the help of IoT, a near-real-time management service comes into being, although the adoption of IoT brings new challenges to management of disruptions. The contributions of this article are as follows: First, a service framework is proposed for refinery which combines MQTT and Azure cloud, enabling reliable data/command delivery. Second, a smart disruption management service system is developed, which consists of monitor and alarm module, disruption management module, and rescheduling procedure module. The rescheduling procedure module takes into account the network of the refinery operations, and is easy to accommodate changes in the refinery configuration for unforeseen disruptions. The experimental results show that the proposed disruption management method balances efficiency and stability compared to traditional methods.
