AB Single-instruction-set architecture (Single-ISA) heterogeneous multi-core processors (HMP) are superior to Symmetric Multi-core processors in performance per watt. They are popular in many aspects of the Internet of Things, including mobile multimedia cloud computing platforms. One Single-ISA HMP integrates both fast out-of-order cores and slow simpler cores, while all cores are sharing the same ISA. The quality of service (QoS) is most important for virtual machine (VM) resource management in multimedia mobile computing, particularly in Single-ISA heterogeneous multi-core cloud computing platforms. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a dynamic cloud resource management (DCRM) policy to improve the QoS in multimedia mobile computing. DCRM dynamically and optimally partitions shared resources according to service or application requirements. Moreover, DCRM combines resource-aware VM allocation to maximize the effectiveness of the heterogeneous multi-core cloud platform. The basic idea for this performance improvement is to balance the shared resource allocations with these resources requirements. The experimental results show that DCRM behaves better in both response time and QoS, thus proving that DCRM is good at shared resource management in mobile media cloud computing.
