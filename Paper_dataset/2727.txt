AB Energy consumption in cloud data centers is increasing as the use of such services increases. It is necessary to propose new methods of decreasing energy consumption. Green cloud computing helps to reduce energy consumption and significantly decreases both operating costs and greenhouse gas emissions. Scheduling the enormous number of user-submitted workflow tasks is an important aspect of cloud computing. Resources in cloud data centers should compute these tasks using energy efficient techniques. This paper proposed a new energy-aware scheduling algorithm for time-constrained workflow tasks using the DVFS method in which the host reduces the operating frequency using different voltage levels. The goal of this research is to reduce energy consumption and SLA violations and improve resource utilization. The simulation results show that the proposed method performs more efficiently when evaluating metrics such as energy utilization, average execution time, average resource utilization and average SLA violation.
