AB Energy consumption has overtaken equipment costs given the growth of computing power, thereby becoming the dominant cost to data centers. Constrained by ensuring that peak resource requirements of VMs are met, the effective use of resource fragments is an effective means of energy conservation. We apply resource reservation to the resource-utilization-aware energy efficient server consolidation algorithm (RUAEE), and propose a server consolidation energy-saving algorithm (SCES). We adjust the allocations of VMs by computing the resource reservation and resource allocation ratio dynamically. This technique maintains the host resource utilization to within a reasonable range, reduces resource fragmentation and reserves resources to satisfy the peak resource requests simultaneously. Compared with the RUAEE algorithm, our algorithm can reduce the risk of system overload and improve the stability of the system. The experimental results based on the actual workload of the Google cluster show that the algorithm is effective at reducing resource waste, improving system stability, and achieving energy savings.
