AB Outsourcing computation with verifiability is a merging notion in cloud computing, which enables lightweight clients to outsource costly computation tasks to the cloud and efficiently check the correctness of the result in the end. This advanced notion is more important in marine mobile computing since the oceangoing vessels are usually constrained with less storage and computation resources. In such a scenario, vessels always firstly outsource data set and perform a function computing over them or at first outsource computing functions and input data set into them. However, vessels may choose which delegation computation type to outsource, which generally depends on the actual circumstances. Hence, we propose a scalable verifiable outsourcing computation protocol (SV-OC) in marine cloud computing at first and extract a single-mode version of it (SM-SV-OC), where both protocols allow anyone who holds verification tokens to efficiently verify the computed result returned from cloud. In this way, the introduced "scalable" property lets vessels adjust the protocol to cope with different delegation situations in practice. We additionally prove both SV-OC and SM-SV-OC achieving selective soundness in the random oracle model and evaluate their performance in the end.
