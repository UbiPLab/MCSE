AB Encryption is the process of disguising text to ensure the confidentiality of data transmitted from one party to another. Homomorphic encryption is one of the most important encryption-related processes which allows performing operation over encrypted data. Using different public key algorithms, homomorphic encryption can be implemented in any scheme. There are many encryption algorithms to secure operations and data storage, which after calculations can obtain the same results. While there is a considerable contribution and enhancement in the field of homomorphic encryption for various performance metrics, there is still an necessity to clarify the applications dealing with this technology. Recently, many distinguished research papers have been filed to address the need for various applications of homomorphic encryption. Recently, many distinguished research papers have been filed to address the need for various applications of homomorphic encryption. Example of these applications but not limited to : Vehicle to Vehicle (v2v) secure communication, cloud security, Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANET), Blockchain, E-Voting, Data mining with privacy preserving and healthcare sector. This article aims to introduce a literature survey to close the gap in homomorphic encryption systems and their applications in the protection of privacy. We focus on above-mentioned applications and present our recommendations for future work.
