AB With the rapid resource requirements of Internet of Things applications, cloud computing technology is regarded as a promising paradigm for resource provision. To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of cloud services, it is essential to improve the resource fairness and achieve energy savings. However, it is still a challenge to schedule the virtual machines in an energy-efficient manner while taking into consideration the resource fairness. In view of this challenge, a fair energy-efficient virtual machine scheduling method for Internet of Things applications is designed in this article. Specifically, energy and fairness are analyzed in a formal way. Then, a virtual machine scheduling method is proposed to achieve the energy efficiency and further improve the resource fairness during the executions of Internet of Things applications. Finally, experimental evaluation demonstrates the validity of our proposed method.
