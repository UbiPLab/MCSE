AB A new era of computing has emerged that focuses on actionable insights and predictive analytics with machine learning and deep learning algorithms. This is referred to as the cognitive era of computing. Servers designed for cognitive computing require a much different architecture than a traditional commercial server designed for database transactional processing and process automation. For example, graphics processing unit acceleration and high-bandwidth I/O for scalability are some of the key requirements for cognitive computing. Another different set of requirements is driven by servers designed for cloud infrastructure. The requirements for a cloud server place an emphasis on the total cost of ownership, total cost of acquisition, as well as compute density and server management. In this paper, we describe the family of IBM POWER9 servers that have been designed to meet the differing requirements for the cognitive, commercial, and cloud market spaces. We describe how each server in the family has been optimized for one (or more) of these workloads by implementing different combinations of POWER9 module packages, memory subsystems, internal storage subsystems, system management, and different levels of reliability, accessibility, and serviceability.
