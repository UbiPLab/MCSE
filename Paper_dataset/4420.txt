AB Mobile edge computing (MEC) is an emergent architecture where cloud computing services are extended to the edge of networks leveraging mobile base stations. As a promising edge technology, it can be applied to mobile, wireless, and wire-line scenarios, using software and hardware platforms, located at the network edge in the vicinity of end-users. MEC provides seamless integration of multiple application service providers and vendors toward mobile subscribers, enterprises, and other vertical segments. It is an important component in the 5G architecture which supports variety of innovative applications and services where ultralow latency is required. This paper is aimed to present a comprehensive survey of relevant research and technological developments in the area of MEC. It provides the definition of MEC, its advantages, architectures, and application areas; where we in particular highlight related research and future directions. Finally, security and privacy issues and related existing solutions are also discussed.
