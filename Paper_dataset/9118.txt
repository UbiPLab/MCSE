ID DATA ANALYTICS
AB Smart grid is an intelligent cyber physical system (CPS). The CPS generates a massive amount of data for efficient grid operation. In this paper, a big data-driven, cloud-based information and communication technology (ICT) framework for smart grid CPS is proposed. The proposed ICT framework deploys hybrid cloud servers to enhance scalability and reliability of smart grid communication infrastructure. Because the data in the ICT framework contains much privacy of customers and important data for automated controlling, the security of data transmission must be ensured. In order to secure the communications over the Internet in the system, identity-based schemes are proposed especially because of their advantage in key management. Specifically, an identity-based signcryption (IBSC) scheme is proposed to provide confidentiality, non-repudiation, and data integrity. For practical purposes, an identity-based signature scheme is relaxed from the proposed IBSC to provide non-repudiation only. Moreover, identity-based schemes are also proposed to achieve signature delegation within the ICT framework. Security of the proposed IBSC scheme is rigorously analyzed in this work. Efficiency of the proposed IBSC scheme is demonstrated with an implementation using modified Weil pairing over an elliptic curve. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
