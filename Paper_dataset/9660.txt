AB Online electronic transactions have become more and more popular in recent years. Electronic cash (e-cash) has acted an important role, but e-cash is digital data that can be copied easily, resulting in double spending. To ensure the security and fairness of transactions, researchers designed secure e-cash payment systems. In 1982, Chaum proposed the first payment scheme using an RSA-based, blind signature to achieve anonymity. Since then, many studies have been conducted, but most related schemes still have high costs associated with the computations. In this paper, we propose a new, secure, e-cash payment system using elliptic curve cryptosystem (ECC) and secret sharing combined with cloud computing to provide lower cost than previous systems. Our proposed scheme also can meet the requirements of a well-designed, secure, e-cash payment system. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
