AB In the past few years, the study on placing edge servers for response time optimization in mobile edge-cloud computing systems has become increasingly popular. Most of the existing schemes neglect two important aspects: one is the heterogeneity of edge/cloud servers and the other is the response time fairness of base stations, which may significantly degrade the system quality of services to mobile users. In this article, we conduct the study of deploying heterogeneous edge servers to optimize the expected response time of both the whole and individual base stations. We propose an approach consisting of offline and online stages. At the offline stage, the optimal placement strategy of heterogeneous edge servers is produced by using an integer linear programming technique. At the online stage, a mobility-aware game-theory-based method is developed to deal with the dynamic characteristic of user movement. Experimental results reveal that compared to benchmarking methods, our approach not only reduces system-expected response time by 47.37% but also improves response time fairness of base stations by 71.60%.
