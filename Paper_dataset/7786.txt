AB Large-scale video surveillance systems are among the necessities for securing our life these days. The high bandwidth demand and the large storage requirements are the main challenges in such systems. To face these challenges, the system can be deployed as a multi-tier framework that utilizes different technologies. In such a framework, technologies proposed under the umbrella of the Internet of Things (IoT) can play a significant rule in facing the challenges. In video surveillance, the cameras can be considered as "the things" that are streaming videos to a central processing and storage server (the cloud) through the Internet. Wireless technologies can be used to connect wireless cameras to the surveillance system more conveniently than wired cameras. Unfortunately, wireless communication in general tend to have limited bandwidth that needs careful management to achieve scalability. In this paper, we design and evaluate a reliable IoT-based wireless video surveillance system that provides an optimal bandwidth distribution and allocation to minimize the overall surveillance video distortion. We evaluate our system using NS-3 simulation. The results show that the proposed framework fully utilizes the available cloud bandwidth budget and achieves high scalability.
