AB The present paper aims at providing an approach for evaluating COBIT as a base framework for cloud computing governance. For that purpose, the authors firstly conducted a systematic research reviews to identify, analyze, and structure the main cloud computing governance requirements. Secondly, with respect to the systematic research review, a mapping of COBIT control objectives to the corresponding cloud computing governance requirements is proposed. Thirdly, the evaluation of the mapped control objectives against the cloud computing governance requirements is performed to identify and analyze the framework gaps. The paper results are relevant outcomes for the extension of COBIT processes and capabilities and thus can provide a base framework for building a holistic cloud computing governance approach.
