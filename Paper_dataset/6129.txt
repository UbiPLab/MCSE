AB The amount of transmitted data through the internet become larger and larger every day. The need of an encryption algorithm that guarantee transmitting data speedily and in a secure manner become a must. The aim of the research is to encrypt and decrypt data efficiently and effectively protect the transmitted data. This research paper presents a model for encrypting transmitted cloud data. This model uses the following encryption algorithms RSA, Triple DES, RC4, and Krishna to generate a new encryption algorithm that encrypt and decrypt transmitted data. The algorithm will help cloud agencies and users to secure their transmitted data and prevent it from being stolen.
