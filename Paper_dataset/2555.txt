AB The state-of-the-art physics alliances have augmented various opportunities to solve complex real-world problems. These problems require both multi-disciplinary expertise as well as large-scale computational experiments. Therefore, the physics community needs a flexible platform which can handle computational challenges such as volume of data, platform heterogeneity, application complexity, etc. Cloud computing provides an incredible amount of resources for scientific users on-demand, thus, it has become a potential platform for executing scientific applications. To manage the resources of Cloud efficiently, it is required to explore the resource prediction and scheduling techniques for scientific applications which can be deployed on Cloud. This paper discusses an extensive analysis of scientific applications, resource predictions and scheduling techniques for Cloud computing environment. Further, the trend of resource prediction-based scheduling and the existing techniques have also been studied. This paper would be helpful for the readers to explore the significance of resource prediction-based scheduling techniques for physics-based scientific applications along with the associated challenges.
