AB The notion of Multi-Key Searchable Encryption (MKSE) enables data owners to outsource their data into a cloud server, while supporting fine-grained data sharing with the authorized users. Note that the traditional MKSE is vulnerable to data leakage. That is, the malicious data owner may collude with the server and recover the search queries of authorized users. Recently, Hamlin et al. (PKC18) presented a new MKSE construction that can ensure data privacy between data owner and authorized users, where the share key is generated depending on data owner, authorized user and the specific document. However, their scheme cannot support verifiable search in the case of the malicious cloud server. In this paper, we propose a new verifiable MKSE (VMKSE) scheme by leveraging Garbled Bloom Filter, which can simultaneously support verifiability of search result and secure data sharing in multi-user setting. Compared to the state-of-the-art solution, the proposed scheme is superior in efficiency and verifiability. The experiment results demonstrate the efficiency of our scheme.
