AB Public key encryption with keyword search plays very important role in the outsourced data management. In most of public key encryption schemes with keyword search, the server can unlimitedly execute keyword search ability after obtaining a trapdoor information of a keyword. To restrict the ability of the server's unlimited search, we propose a novel public key encryption with revocable keyword search by combining hash chain and anonymous multi-receiver encryption scheme in this paper. The scheme can not only achieve security property of the indistinguishability of ciphertexts against an adaptive chosen keywords attack, but also resist off-line keyword guess attack. By comparison with Yu et al.'s scheme, our scheme is more efficient in terms of computational cost and communication overhead for the whole system.
