AB Cloud applications can benefit from the on- demand capacity of cloud infrastructures, which offer computing and data resources with diverse capabilities, pricing, and quality models. However, state-of-the-art tools mainly enable the user to specify " if-then-else" policies concerning resource usage and size, resulting in a cumbersome specification process that lacks expressiveness for enabling the control of complex multilevel elasticity requirements.
   In this article, first we propose SYBL, a novel language for specifying elasticity requirements at multiple levels of abstraction. Second, we design and develop the rSYBL framework for controlling cloud services at multiple levels of abstractions. To enforce user-specified requirements, we develop a multilevel elasticity controlmechanism enhanced with conflict resolution. rSYBL supports different cloud providers and is highly extensible, allowing service providers or developers to define their own connectors to the desired infrastructures or tools. We validate it through experiments with two distinct services, evaluating rSYBL over two distinct cloud infrastructures, and showing the importance of multilevel elasticity control.
