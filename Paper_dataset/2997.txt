AB Cloud computing can be classified as a third-generation computing platform which refers to on-demand delivery of computing infrastructure and services via a network, usually the Internet. Cloud computing promises to provide several advantages to its adopters such as: cost advantage, availability, scalability, flexibility, reduced time to market and dynamic access to computational resources. Notwithstanding the numerous advantages of cloud computing, its implementation and adoption in developing countries is still limited and surrounded by variety of issues. Hence, the main objective of this article is to identify the main challenges facing the utilization of these services in developing countries, particularly Jordan. To achieve the above-mentioned objective, six in-depth interviews with ICT officials and experts in the domain of cloud computing were used as the main data collection method. The challenges of cloud computing adoption emerged in this study are classified into technological, organizational and environmental factors.
