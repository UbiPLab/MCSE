AB The emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) is empowered by the availability of the high volume of smart sensors, Radio Frequency Identification, a suitable communication technologies and protocols. In the near future, the Internet will be full of heterogeneous connected devices. In recent years, the IoT has drawn significant attention as it can solve difficult problems. However, the heterogeneity of devices and the large scale networks expose the IoT to many challenges that must be addressed; otherwise, the systems performance will deteriorate. As an attempt to identify these challenges, this paper comprehensibly cites the main IoT concepts, the serious IoT challenges and the quality of services presented in the recent literature. It also investigates the corresponding main research directions and the proposed solutions. This paper can increase the knowledge of the reader since it is the first IoT survey that presents load balancing algorithms utilized in solving the extreme data storage challenge.
