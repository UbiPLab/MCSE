AB The massive redundant data storage and communication in network 4.0 environments have issues of low integrity, high cost, and easy tampering. To address these issues, in this article, a secure data storage and recovery scheme in the blockchain-based network is proposed by improving the decentration, tampering-proof, real-time monitoring, and management of storage systems, as such design supports the dynamic storage, fast repair, and update of distributed data in the data storage system of industrial nodes. A local regenerative code technology is used to repair and store data between failed nodes while ensuring the privacy of user data. That is, as the data stored are found to be damaged, multiple local repair groups constructed by vector code can simultaneously yet efficiently repair multiple distributed data storage nodes. Based on the unique chain storage structure, such as data consensus mechanism and smart contract, the storage structure of blockchain distributed coding not only quickly repair the nearby local regenerative codes in the blockchain but also reduce the resource overhead in the data storage process of industrial nodes. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme improves the repair rate of multinode data by 9% and data storage rate increased by 8.6%, indicating to be promising with good security and real-time performance.
