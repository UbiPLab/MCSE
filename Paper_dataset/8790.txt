AB With the development of cloud storage and the rise of big data, the amount of data information is growing exponentially. The diversification of the storage mode has contributed to the generation of distributed data mining. Besides, under the grid computing environment, distributed data mining is based on the analysis, classification and mining of a large number of data. In this paper, based on the grid computing environment, the distributed data mining technology was used, and the data of distributed storage was analyzed. A set of data mining computing platform with the functions of the distribution, the isomerization, the on-line elasticity expansion and the analysis data was established. A new way of thinking for the construction of distributed data mining system was proposed.
