AB Information-Centric Networking (ICN) enables in-network data management and communication between multiple parties by replicating data and activating interactions between decoupled senders and receivers. Existing data management and offloading schemes in ICNs primarily use the transport layer hence it becomes inefficient to actively develop and update the ICN standards because of continuously evolving heterogeneous future internet architectures such as mobile edge cloud computing (MECC) architectures. In this paper, we present an adaptive execution model for mobile data stream mining (MDSM) applications in MECC environments to enable device-centric adaptive data management and offloading. We designed the proposed execution model considering multiple factors of complexity such as volume and velocity of continuously streaming data, the selection of data fusion and data preprocessing methods, the choice of learning models, learning rates, learning modes, mobility, limited computational and memory resources in mobile devices, the high coupling between application components, and dependency over Internet connections. We integrated the proposed execution model with multiple MDSM applications mapping to a real-word use-case for activity detection using MECC as a future network architecture. We thoroughly evaluated the proposed execution model in terms of battery power consumption, memory utilization, makespan, accuracy, and the amount of data reduced during in-network communication. The comparison showed that our proposed adaptive execution model outperformed the static and dynamic execution models which were deployed in the same ICN architecture. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.
