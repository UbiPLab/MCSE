AB Energy saving in a Cloud Computing environment is a multidimensional challenge, which can directly decrease the in-use costs and carbon dioxide emission, while raising the system consistency. The process of maximizing the cloud computing resource utilization which brings many benefits such as better use of resources, rationalization of maintenance, IT service customization, QoS and reliable services, etc., is known as task consolidation. This article suggests the energy saving with task consolidation, by minimizing the number of unused resources in a cloud computing environment. In this article, various task consolidation algorithms such as MinIncreaseinEnergy, MaxUtilECTC, NoIdleMachineECTC, and NoIdleMachineMaxUtil are presented aims to optimize energy consumption of cloud data center. The outcomes have shown that the suggested algorithms surpass the existing ECTC and FCFSMaxUtil, MaxMaxUtil algorithms in terms of the CPU utilization and energy consumption.
