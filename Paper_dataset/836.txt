AB Considering cloud computing from an organizational and end user computing point of view, it is a new paradigm for deploying, managing and offering services through a shared infrastructure. Current development of cloud computing applications, however, are the lack of a uniformly approach to cope with the heterogeneous information fusion. This leads cloud computing to inefficient development and a low potential reuse. This study addresses these issues to propose a novel Web 2.0 Mashups as a Service, called WMaaS, which is a fundamental cloud service model. The WMaaS is developed based on a XML-based Mashups Architecture (XMA) that is composed of Web 2.0 Mashups technologies, including Web Data, Web API, Web Interaction, and Web Presentation to associate with existing service models. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, this study implemented a Ubiquitous Location-based Service System (ULSS) that is a cloud computing application developed based on WMaaS to provide continuous and location-based schedule information for organization monitoring and end user needs.
