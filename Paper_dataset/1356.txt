ID CLOUD
AB Mobile cloud computing is an approach for mobile devices with processing and storage limitations to take advantage of remote resources that assist in performing computationally intensive or data-intensive tasks. The migration of tasks or data is commonly referred to as offloading, and its proper use can bring benefits such as performance improvement or reduced power consumption on mobile devices. In this paper, we face three challenges for any offloading solution: the decision of when and where to perform offloading, the decision of which metrics must be monitored by the offloading system, and the support for user's mobility in a hybrid environment composed of cloudlets and public cloud instances. We introduce novel approaches based on machine learning and software-defined networking techniques for handling these challenges. In addition, we present details of our offloading system and the experiments conducted to assess the proposed approaches.
