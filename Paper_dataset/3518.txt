AB Protein folding is the important concepts for various research areas such as chemistry, biology, biochemistry, physics and computer science. The proteins have the special functional and characteristics information which is used to analyze the genome functionality also used to understand the different pathologies. Then the required protein information need to be searched and obtained for making the efficient protein folding structure because the wrong protein folding structure creates the neurodegenerative disease in the human beings. So, the required protein structure information has been retrieved from the cloud environment because it contains the lot of information about the protein structure. While accessing the protein information from the cloud environment, it consumes maximum high time so, the proposed system forms the virtual networks to access the information with minimum time. The proposed system determining the maximum number of disjoints routes which form the multi-channel virtual paths with minimum time complexity.
