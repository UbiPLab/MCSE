AB A protected and dynamic more-keyword related ranked search on encrypted data on cloud storage is increasing because of the cloud computing popularity; more users are provoked to store their data on cloud server for huge expedience and minimum cost in management of data. On the other hand, privacy data have to encrypted before outsource to cloud storage, that obsoletes data use like keyword related document recovery. In our proposed system, we suggest a protected multi-keyword related ranked search method on encrypted data on cloud storage, that concurrently helps dynamic operations such as interpolation and expunction of documents. Particularly, the model of vector space and more used TF-IDF method are joined in the construction of index and generation of query. We suggest a algorithm of "Greedy Depth-first search" and built a particular tree-related index scheme. The kNN technique is used to encrypt the query and index vectors, and same time assure correct significance score computation berween query vectors and index vectors. In the way to oppose the attacks related to statistical, terms of phantom are joined to the vector index for search results of blinding. Because of the use of particular tree-related structure of index, the suggested method can helps sub-linear time of search and contract with interpolation and expunction of documents lithely. Some wide-ranging testing is conducted to show the proposed system efficiency.
