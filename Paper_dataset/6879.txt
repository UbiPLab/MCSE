AB Most of the web service selection methods don't account for conflicting objectives. These work by combining the objective function into a single objective function by scalarization. When the value of weights is, not given and fixed weights are used, this can lead to problems. In this paper, modified reinforcement learning algorithms are proposed which are used to derive Single policy and multiple policy solutions respectively and applies the concept of multi-agent Reinforcement learning and value iteration respectively in the original algorithm which uses fixed weights, our algorithm modifies the weights in order to achieve output. Our proposal algorithm dynamically updates the weight for the objectives functions in the value function vector to achieve accuracy especially for large no. of states (value function approximation). Our modified algorithm uses the combination of multi objectives reinforcement learning with value function approximation to achieve better results. We are formulating the problem as a multi objectives partially observable Markov Decision Model problem description. In pervasive environment, such technique can prove to be useful for selecting web services. Examples of such services are E-Governance applications.
