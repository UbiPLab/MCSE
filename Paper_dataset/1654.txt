AB The current communication scheduling algorithm for smart home cannot realize low latency in scheduling effect with unreasonable control of communication throughput and large energy consumption. In this paper, a communication scheduling algorithm for smart home in Internet of Things under cloud computing based on particle swarm is proposed. According to the fact that the transmission bandwidth of any data flow is limited by the bandwidth of network card of sending end and receiving end, the bandwidth limits of network card of smart home communication server are used to predict the maximum practicable bandwidth of data flow. Firstly, the initial value of communication scheduling objective function of smart home and particle swarm is set, and the objective function is taken as the fitness function of particle. Then the current optimal solution of objective function is calculated through predicted value and objective function, current position and flight speed of particle should be updated until the iteration conditions are met. Finally, the optimal solution is output, the communication scheduling of smart home is thus realized. Experiments show that this algorithm can realize low latency with small energy consumption, and the throughput is relatively reasonable.
