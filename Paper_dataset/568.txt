AB The proposed framework of Four Layer Robust Storage in Cloud (FLRSC) architecture involves host server, local host and edge devices in addition to Virtual Machine Monitoring (VMM). The goal is to protect the privacy of stored data at edge devices. The computational intelligence (CI) part of our algorithm distributes blocks of data to three different layers by partially encoded and forwarded for decoding to the next layer using hash and greed Solomon algorithms. VMM monitoring uses snapshot algorithm to detect intrusion. The proposed system is compared with Tiang Wang method to validate efficiency of data transfer with security. Hence, security is proven against the indexed efficiency. It is an important study to integrate communication between local host software and nearer edge devices through different channels by verifying snapshot using lamport mechanism to ensure integrity and security at software level thereby reducing the latency. It also provides thorough knowledge and understanding about data communication at software level with VMM. The performance evaluation and feasibility study of security in FLRSC against three-layered approach is proven over 2(32) blocks of data with 98% accuracy. Practical implications and contributions to the growing knowledge base are highlighted along with directions for further research.
