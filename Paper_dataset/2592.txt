AB The mobile edge computation offloading (MECO) system has emerged as a promising technology to address several problematic issues in cloud computing such as data throughput, capacity, and security. In this letter, we consider a single-cloud-multi-user MECO system with orthogonal frequency-division multiple access and propose an optimal pricing scheme to consider each mobile user's (MU) need for resources. The proposed model was formulated as a single-leader-multi-user Stackelberg game model, and the Stackelberg equilibrium was provided to optimize the utility of the MUs and the edge cloud. Here, the utility of the MU implies the energy efficiency and payment for using the computation capacity of the edge cloud, and the utility of the edge cloud implies the revenue for serving computation offloading. The optimal strategies of the MUs are uniquely given by closed-form expressions, and that of the edge cloud is given by gradient descent methods. Some numerical examples are provided to verify our approach.
