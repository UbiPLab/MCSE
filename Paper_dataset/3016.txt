AB This article describes how Cloud Computing is not just a buzzword but a shift from IT departments to the outsourcing vendors without impacting business efficiency. Some organizations are moving towards cloud computing but many have resistance to adopting cloud computing due to limitations in knowledge and awareness of the classifying elements, which effect decisions on the acceptance of cloud computing. Therefore, this article has focused on accumulating the elements, which can act as enablers, by reviewing existing literature and studies from both professional and academic viewpoints. All the identified enablers have been structurally modeled to develop the relationship matrix and establish the driving power and dependence power of every element. This is done by employing Total Interpretive Structural Modeling (TISM) and Cross Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC) analysis.
