AB For the canonical dispatching problem of uniprocess servicing of the object flow, the efficiency of cluster implementation of the solving algorithm designed on the basis of the concept of discrete dynamic programming is investigated. The main idea of the proposed computational model is the method of balancing the load of cluster nodes by parallel execution of forward looking transmission of inherited information. As confirmed by computational experiments, this approach can significantly reduce the time delays in the exchange of data between nodes and increase the scale of problems solved in a reasonable time. The described method of balancing is implemented in the computational model of the office network and proven on the tasks of synthesizing schedules for the supply of the flow of river cargo ships and trains arriving at the dedicated terminal for stowing during the peak periods of deliveries of goods to the Northern Territories.
   When scaling the proposed computational model onto the cloud environment, it is possible to use virtual infrastructures of well-known commercial platforms for solving dispatching tasks of substantially higher scale.
