AB Cloud computing is a recent and significant development in the domain of network applications with a new information technology perspective. This study attempts to develop a hybrid model to predict motivators influencing the adoption of cloud computing services by information technology (IT) professionals. The research proposes a new model by extending the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with three external constructs namely computer self-efficacy, trust, and job opportunity. One of the main contributions of this research is the introduction of a new construct, Job Opportunity (JO), for the first time in a technology adoption study. Data were collected from 101 IT professional and analyzed using multiple linear regression (MLR) and neural network (NN) modeling. Based on the RMSE values from the results of these models NN models were found to outperform the MLR model. The results obtained from MLR showed that computer self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, trust, perceived ease of use, and job opportunity. However, the NN models result showed that the best predictor of cloud computing adoption are job opportunity, trust, perceived usefulness, self-efficacy, and perceived ease of use. The findings of this study confirm the need to extend the fundamental TAM when studying a recent technology like cloud computing. This study will provide insights to IT service providers, government agencies, academicians, researchers and IT professionals. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
