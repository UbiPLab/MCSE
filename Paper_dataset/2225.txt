AB In cloud computing, scheduling plays an eminent role while processing enormous jobs. The paralle jobs utmost need parallel processing capabilities which leads to CPU underutilization mainly due to synchronization and communication among parallel processes. Researchers introduced several algorithms for scheduleing parallel jobs namely, Conservative Migration Consolidation supported Backfilling (CMCBF) and Aggressive Migration Consolidation supported Backfilling (AMCBF). The greatest challenge of a existing scheduling algorithm is to improve the data center utilization without affecting job responsiveness. Hence, this work proposes an Effective Multiphase Scheduling Approach (EMSA) to process the jobs. In EMSA, the jobs are initially preprocessed and batched together to avoid starvation and to mitigate unwanted delay. Later, an Associate Priority Method has been proposed which prioritizes the batch jobs to minimize the number of migrations. Finally, the prioritized jobs are scheduled using Priority Scheduling with BackFilling algorithm to utilize the intermediate idle nodes. Moreover, the virtualization technology partitions the computing capacity of the Virtual Machine (VM) into two-tier VM as foreground VM (FVM) and Background VM (BVM) to improve node utilization. Hence, Priority Scheduling with Consolidation based BackFilling algorithm has been deployed in a two-tier VM that processes the jobs by utilizing the VMs effectively. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed work performs better than other existing algorithms by increasing the resource utilization by 8%.
