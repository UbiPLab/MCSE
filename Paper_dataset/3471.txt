AB The enhanced form of client-server, cluster and grid computing is termed as Cloud Computing. The cloud users can virtually access the resources over the internet. Task submitted by cloud users are responsible for efficiency and performance of cloud computing services. One of the most essential factors which increase the efficiency and performance of cloud environment by maximizing the resource utilization is termed as Task Scheduling. This paper deals with the survey of different scheduling algorithms used in cloud providers. Different scheduling algorithms are available to achieve the quality of service, performance and minimize execution time. Task scheduling is an essential downside within the cloud computing that has to be optimized by combining different parameter. This paper explains the comparison of several job scheduling techniques with respect to several parameters, like response time, load balance, execution time and makespan of job to find the best and efficient task scheduling algorithm under these parameters. The comparison of scheduling algorithms is also discussed in tabular form in this paper which helps in finding the best algorithms.
