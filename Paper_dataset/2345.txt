AB Mobile cloud computing is a paradigm that delivers applications to mobile devices by using cloud computing. In this way, mobile cloud computing allows for a rich user experience; since client applications run remotely in the cloud infrastructure, applications use fewer resources in the user's mobile devices. In this paper, we present a new mobile cloud computing model, in which platforms of volunteer devices provide part of the resources of the cloud, inspired by both volunteer computing and mobile edge computing paradigms. These platforms may be hierarchical, based on the capabilities of the volunteer devices and the requirements of the services provided by the clouds. We also describe the orchestration between the volunteer platform and the public, private or hybrid clouds. As we show, this new model can be an inexpensive solution to different application scenarios, highlighting its benefits in cost savings, elasticity, scalability, load balancing, and efficiency. Moreover, with the evaluation performed we also show that our proposed model is a feasible solution for cloud services that have a large number of mobile users. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.
