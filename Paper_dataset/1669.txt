ID HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY
AB Edge computing paradigm has attracted many interests in the last few years as a valid alternative to the standard cloud-based approaches to reduce the interaction timing and the huge amount of data coming from Internet of Things (IoT) devices toward the Internet. In the next future, Edge-based approaches will be essential to support time-dependent applications in the Industry 4.0 context; thus, the paper proposes BodyEdge, a novel architecture well suited for human-centric applications, in the context of the emerging healthcare industry. It consists of a tiny mobile client module and a performing edge gateway supporting multiradio and multitechnology communication to collect and locally process data coming from different scenarios; moreover, it also exploits the facilities made available from both private and public cloud platforms to guarantee a high flexibility, robustness, and adaptive service level. The advantages of the designed software platform have been evaluated in terms of reduced transmitted data and processing time through a real implementation on different hardware platforms. The conducted study also highlighted the network conditions (data load and processing delay) in which BodyEdge is a valid and inexpensive solution for healthcare application scenarios.
