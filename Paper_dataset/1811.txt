AB In recent years, the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) and big data shows the huge demand of outsourcing computing in cloud computing to assist some clients with low ability devices to fulfill massive data processing. In the mean time, considering the uncertainty of the Internet devices, we should persist security and high-efficiency. Uploaded data and returned results should be protected from attack of adversary, which guarantees the security, while efficiency requires low overhead of clients to finish the whole calculation procedure. In this paper, we main focus on the public verifiable outsourcing scheme on matrix multiplication, which can be applied in many IoT scenes, such as path planning and aggregation operation in Internet of Vehicles and smart grids, respectively. Specially, this paper presents schemes for two different functions of matrix multiplication, which strengthens the applicability. Moreover, security analysis and performance evaluation in this paper properly present the superiority of this paper.
