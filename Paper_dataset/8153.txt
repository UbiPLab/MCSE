AB The cloud computing paradigm has the ability to adapt to new technologies and provide consistent cloud services. These features have led to the widespread use of the paradigm, making it necessary for the underlying computer infrastructure to cope with the increased demand and the high number of end users. Platforms often use classical mathematical models for this purpose, helping assign computational resources to the services provided to the final user. Although this kind of model is valid and widespread, it can be refined through intelligent techniques. Therefore, this research presents a novel system consisting of a multi-agent system, which integrates a case-based reasoning system. The resulting system dynamically allocates resources within a cloud computing platform. This approach, which is distributed and scalable, can learn from previous experiences and produce better results in each resource allocation. A model of the system has been implemented and tested on a real cloud platform with successful results.
