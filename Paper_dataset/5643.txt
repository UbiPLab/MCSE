AB The cloud storage service becomes a popular tendency based on the cloud computing, which can solve user's storage bottleneck problem. Data security problems are solved by remote data auditing in cloud storage, which attracts more researchers to pay attention to data verification. In this paper, a new replay attack is defined, and attack process is analyzed in some schemes which cannot avoid the new replay attack. An auditing protocol is proposed that can withstand this attack and supports public auditing, dynamic auditing and batch auditing. The proposed scheme introduces a new data structure which is stored locally by users for dynamic operation. It can avoid the third part auditor getting the outsourced data information. Compared with the related schemes, the experimental results show that the computation costs of the proposal are reasonable and are highly efficient in the stage of verification.
