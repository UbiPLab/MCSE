AB To protect the patient's privacy in cloud-assisted wireless body area networks (CWBANs), this paper proposes a secure and efficient health data aggregation scheme with fine-grained access control and verifiability. Our scheme can not only make patients get rid of worries about the privacy for their health data, but also achieve secure fine-grained access control by employing ciphertext-policy attribute based encryption (CP-ABE). To enable CP-ABE to be effectively used in CWBANs, we outsource the burdensome computational task of CP-ABE to cloud server, which results in a significant reduction on computing overhead for the sensors or the data sink. In our scheme, the huge amount of health data collected by the sensors are efficiently aggregated with confidentiality at the data sink, then forwarded to the cloud server, which significantly reduces the transmission cost from the data sink to the cloud server. Moreover, our scheme allows the data sink and doctors to check whether the transformation process is performed correctly. As a result, the attacker's malicious behaviors and incorrect data in the transformation can be detected in our scheme. The security analysis and performance evaluation show our scheme is secure and efficient.
