AB Recognizing and retrieving multimedia content with movie/TV series actors, especially querying actor-specific videos in large scale video datasets, has attracted much attention in both the video processing and computer vision research field. However, many existing methods have low efficiency both in training and testing processes and also a less than satisfactory performance. Considering these challenges, in this paper, we propose an efficient cloud-based actor identification approach with batch-orthogonal local-sensitive hashing (BOLSH) and multi-task joint sparse representation classification. Our approach is featured by the following: 1) videos from movie/TV series are segmented into shots with the cloud-based shot boundary detection; 2) while faces in each shot are detected and tracked, the cloud-based BOLSH is then implemented on these faces for feature description; 3) the sparse representation is then adopted for actor identification in each shot; and 4) finally, a simple application, actor-specific shots retrieval is realized to verify our approach. We conduct extensive experiments and empirical evaluations on a large scale dataset, to demonstrate the satisfying performance of our approach considering both accuracy and efficiency.
