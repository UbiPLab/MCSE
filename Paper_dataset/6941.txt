AB The results of analysis of long-term radar observations of hailstorms are presented. The dynamic characteristics of formation and development of hail cores in severe convective clouds are studied. The statistical sample of radar data included 314 hail cells; for each cell the temporal distributions of measured and computed major radar parameters were constructed using the automated system of acquisition, processing, and presentation of radar data. The most informative time characteristics of hail cores' development and the interrelation between them were identified. The natural variability of hail core volume is demonstrated. The empirical dependence of the maximum hail core volume on the maximum radar reflectivity of a hailstorm was obtained.
