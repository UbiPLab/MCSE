AB The application of high-bandwidth networks and cloud computing in manufacturing systems will be followed by mass data. Industrial data analysis plays important roles in condition monitoring, performance optimization, flexibility, and transparency of the manufacturing system. However, the currently existing architectures are mainly for offline data analysis, not suitable for real-time data processing. In this paper, we first define the smart factory as a cloud-assisted and self-organized manufacturing system in which physical entities such as machines, conveyors, and products organize production through intelligent negotiation and the cloud supervises this self-organized process for fault detection and troubleshooting based on data analysis. Then, we propose a scheme to integrate knowledge reasoning and semantic data where the reasoning engine processes the ontology model with real time semantic data coming from the production process. Based on these ideas, we build a benchmarking system for smart candy packing application that supports direct consumer customization and flexible hybrid production, and the data are collected and processed in real time for fault diagnosis and statistical analysis.
