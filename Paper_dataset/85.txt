AB The high energy consumption of cloud data centers is one of the key issues restricting the future development of the cloud computing industry. For two-tier virtualized data centers in which containers are deployed on VMs, this paper conducts an in-depth study of this problem from the aspect of resource management. First, the working model of two-tier virtualized data center is defined. By mapping tasks to containers and using VMs to isolate different jobs, this model improves the resource utilization of hosts while ensuring the isolation and security of jobs. Then, an energy-aware host resource management framework is constructed, which includes two algorithms. The initial static placement is a two-tier scheduling algorithm, including the load balancing alternate placement and the two-sided matching methods to complete the placement of containers to VMs and VMs to hosts respectively. The runtime dynamic consolidation algorithm takes the initial placement scheme as input, and utilizes the dynamic consolidation method to use the least active hosts to meet the real-time resource requirements of containers. Finally, simulation experiments compared with related algorithms are conducted using real workload traces. The results show that the proposed two algorithms have better performance in host resource utilization, number of active hosts, number of container migrations and SLA metric. And the entire framework achieves an energy-saving effect of 13.8% at least.
