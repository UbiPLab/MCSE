AB With the advent of cloud computing, a cost-effective and reliable choice to employ IT infrastructure, the cyber-physical systems (CPS) are transforming into loosely coupled cloud and fog CPS. The sensor information from physical processes at CPS is continuously processed by fog computing nodes and is forwarded for advanced data analytics offered as a service from the cloud. The computation offloaded by fog devices are initiated as Virtual Machines (VMs) in the cloud data center. The effective placement of these VMs into minimum Physical Machines (PMs) involves economic and environmental issues. Recent research works signify the use of First-Fit Decreasing (FFD) based heuristic techniques to address this NP-Hard problem as a vector bin-packing problem. In this research work, we present a set of hybrid heuristics and an ensemble heuristic to improve the solution quality. The simulation results show that the proposed heuristics are highly scalable and economical in comparison with the individual heuristic-based approaches.
