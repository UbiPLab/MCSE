ID ATTRIBUTE-BASED ENCRYPTION; SECURE
AB Cloud computing has great economical advantages and wide application, more and more data owners store their data in the cloud storage server (CSS) to avoid tedious local data management and insufficient storage resources. But the privacy of data owners faces enormous challenges. The most recent searchable encryption technology adopts the ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE), which is one good method to deal with this security issue. However, the access attributes of the users are transmitted and assigned in plaintext form. In this paper, we propose a based on blinded CP-ABE searchable encryption cloud storage service (BCP-ABE-SECSS) scheme, which can blind the access attributes of the users in order to prevent the collusion attacks of the CSS and the users. Data encryption and keyword index generation are performed by the data owners; meanwhile, we construct that CSS not only executes the access control policy of the data but also performs the pre-decryption operation about the encrypted data to solve higher time cost of decryption calculation to the data users. Security proof results show that this scheme has access attribute security, data confidentiality, indistinguishable security against chosen keyword attack, and resisting the collusion attack between the data user and the CSS. Performance analysis and the experimental results show that this scheme can effectively reduce the computation time cost of the data owners and the data users.
