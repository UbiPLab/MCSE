AB Mobile devices, along with wearable sensors, allow patients to access healthcare services from anywhere at any time. The longstanding constraints of computational capability and storage space on mobile devices can be alleviated by outsourcing computation- or data-intensive tasks to remote cloud centers. Thus, mobile cloud computing (MCC) has been recognized as a promising approach to provide pervasive healthcare services to people in their daily life. As the development and adoption of MCC techniques in healthcare, new optimization strategies have been explored and studied to help mobile cloud healthcare services to be deployed in a more effective and efficient manner. In this survey, we demonstrate how MCC techniques have been extensively deployed in various healthcare applications and, specifically, describe the general architecture and design considerations one should take into account while designing an MCC for healthcare scenarios. Given a large number of factors that may affect the performance of the MCC and even result in catastrophic consequences in healthcare, this paper presents the state-of-the-art optimization methods on the MCC for meeting the diverse priorities and achieving the optimal tradeoff among multiple objectives. Finally, the security and privacy issues of the MCC in healthcare are also discussed.
