AB With the development of cloud storage and the rise of big data, the amount of data information has increased exponentially, and the diversification of storage has prompted the generation of cloud computing data center. Virtual technology has brought new opportunities for data caching and real-time distribution of cloud computing data center. Based on the virtual technology of cloud computing data center caching and data real-time distribution, in this paper, the traditional methods of data transmission were compared with the virtual technology's storage time, storage capacity and other parameters. The practice proves that the scheme can improve the utilization rate of resources and the availability of the system, and can effectively improve the system running time.
