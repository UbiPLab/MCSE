AB Modern data center consists of thousands of servers, racks and switches. Complicated structure means it requires well-designed algorithms to utilize resources of data centers efficiently. Current virtual machine scheduling algorithms mainly focus on the initial allocation of virtual machines based on the CPU, memory and network bandwidth requirements. However, when tasks finished or lease expired, related virtual machines would be deleted from the system which would generate resource fragments. Such fragments lead to unbalanced resource utilization and decline of communication performance. This paper investigates the network influence on typical applications in data centers and proposed a self-adaptive network-aware virtual machine clustering and consolidation algorithm to maintain an optimal system-wide status. Our consolidation algorithm periodically checks whether consolidation is necessary and then clusters and consolidates virtual machines to lower communication cost with an online heuristic. We used two benchmarks in a real environment to examine network influence on different tasks. To evaluate the advantages of the proposed algorithm, we also built a cloud computing testbed. Real workload trace-driven simulations and testbed-based experiments showed that, our algorithm greatly shortened the average finish time of map-reduce tasks and reduced time delay of web applications. Simulation results showed that our algorithm considerably reduced the amount of high-delay jobs, lowered the average traffic passed through aggregate switches and improved the communication ability among virtual machines.
