AB The development of global informatization and its integration with industrialization symbolizes that human society has entered into the big data era. This article covers seven new characteristics of Geomatics (i.e. ubiquitous sensor, multi-dimensional dynamics, integration via networking, full automation in real time, from sensing to recognition, crowdsourcing and volunteered geographic information, and service-oriented science), and puts forward the corresponding critical technical challenges in the construction of integrated space-air-ground geospatial networks. Through the discussions outlined in this paper, we propose a new development stage of Geomatics entitled 'Connected Geomatics,' which is defined as a multi-disciplinary science and technology that uses systematic approaches and integrates methods of spatio-temporal data acquisition, information extraction, network management, knowledge discovery, and spatial sensing and recognition, as well as intelligent location-based services pertaining to any physical objects and human activities on the earth. It is envisioned that the advancement of Geomatics will make a great contribution to human sustainable development.
