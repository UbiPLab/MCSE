AB A multitude of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) has been presented recently to solve the privacy problems of contemporary services utilizing cloud computing. Many of them are based on additively homomorphic encryption (AHE) that allows the computation of additions on encrypted data. The main technical obstacles for adaptation of PETs in practical systems are related to performance overheads compared with current privacy-violating alternatives. In this article, we present a hardware/software (HW/SW) codesign for programmable systems-on-chip (SoCs) that is designed for accelerating applications based on the Paillier encryption. Our implementation is a microcode-based multicore architecture that is suitable for accelerating various PETs using AHE with large integer modular arithmetic. We instantiate the implementation in a Xilinx Zynq-7000 programmable SoC and provide performance evaluations in real hardware. We also investigate its efficiency in a high-end Xilinx UltraScale+ programmable SoC. We evaluate the implementation with two target use cases that have relevance in PETs: privacy-preserving computation of squared Euclidean distances over encrypted data and multi-input functional encryption (FE) for inner products. Both of them represent the first hardware acceleration results for such operations, and in particular, the latter one is among the very first published implementation results of FE on any platform.
