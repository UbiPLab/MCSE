AB Photogrammetric procedures using the integration of imagery and light detection and ranging (Lidar) datasets are becoming common in mapping companies nowadays. When photogrammetric and Lidar surveys are performed simultaneously while having the camera connected to the Lidar system, the image's exterior orientation parameters computed from the Lidar system can be used to perform photogrammetric applications. To implement such approach, camera calibration procedures should be applied to obtain accurate interior orientation parameters. This paper shows the performed study and experimental results from an in situ self-calibration using simultaneously collected imagery and Lidar datasets. The experimental study is conducted to devise a methodology for the in situ self-calibration that uses a set of vertical control points, extracted from Lidar point cloud, as well as the three-dimensional coordinates of the camera exposure stations, computed from the Lidar trajectory. For the small photogrammetric block used in this study, the results from the performed experiments demonstrated that the in situ self-calibration is required to obtain horizontal accuracies of approximately one image pixel on the ground in bundle adjustment assisted by direct measured of the coordinates of the camera exposure stations.
