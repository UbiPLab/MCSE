AB Cloud computing is alluring for the vehicular mesh (VMesh) network. Cloud computing stipulates the computing resources and services on demand using the Internet. The VMesh network is a type of networking where each vehicle must not only capture and disseminate its own data but also serve as a gateway for another vehicle. The cloud-VMesh network is a convergent technology encompassed of three key technologies, namely, vehicular mesh network, cloud computing, and networking. In this paper, we propose a new routing algorithm for cloud-VMesh network, dubbed as adroit algorithm. The proposed adroit algorithm addresses the choosing of an optimal gateway and base station in the network layer from and to the service requesters and cloud server. The simulation study shows that the adroit algorithm augments the routing issues such as delay, packet loss, congestion and deployment cost in the cloud-VMesh network, and it is justified based on the packet delivery ratio, average response time, routing overhead ratio, and packet collision ratio. The simulation results demonstrate that the adroit algorithm outperforms the existing protocols. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
