AB When the requirements and processing appetites grew sufficiently in the era of personal computing, users began to think about cloud servers. This initiated the growth of cloud computing and set up the era of Everything-as-a-Service. When the IoT idea spread, lots of sensors and smaller devices were introduced for ubiquitous and pervasive computing. The simplest way to collect and process all this data was to connect the devices to the cloud. This required high-speed networks and interconnections. However, no matter how fast they could go, engineers understood that there's no need to transfer all the data through links to the central data server, and that it would be much more efficient to distribute smaller servers in front of the central data server and closer to the location of the user. This began the evolution of pushing data collection and processing back to end-user devices, as a new computing approach called edge computing, which appears in different forms such as fog computing, cloudlets, and mobile edge computing.
