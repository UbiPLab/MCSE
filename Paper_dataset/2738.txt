AB Mobile devices have several restrictions due to design choices that guarantee their mobility. A way of surpassing such limitations is to utilize cloud servers called cloudlets on the edge of the network through Mobile Edge Computing. However, as the number of clients and devices grows, the service must also increase its scalability in order to guarantee a latency limit and quality threshold. This can be achieved by deploying and activating more cloudlets, but this solution is expensive due to the cost of the physical servers. The best choice is to optimize the resources of the cloudlets through an intelligent choice of configuration that lowers delay and raises scalability. Thus, in this paper we propose an algorithm that utilizes Virtual Machine Migration and Transmission Power Control, together with a mathematical model of delay in Mobile Edge Computing and a heuristic algorithm called Particle Swarm Optimization, to balance the workload between cloudlets and consequently maximize cost-effectiveness. Our proposal is the first to consider simultaneously communication, computation, and migration in our assumed scale and, due to that, manages to outperform other conventional methods in terms of number of serviced users.
