AB In this paper, we present an effective and efficient Byzantine-resilient dual membership management technique in cloud environments, in which nodes are prone to churn and the network topology is not fully connected. Our method is based on unstructured message communication model, namely a gossip protocol that is able to handle the dynamic behavior of nodes properly in the system. We argue that due to the presence of malicious Byzantine nodes, existing membership management mechanisms are not suitable for preserving uniformity of random sampling. Therefore, we propose a new membership management mechanism using gossip with social membership information. The proposed membership management scheme maintains not only neighbor nodes in a social graph, but also Byzantine nodes in a local data structure. The results show that our dual membership management effectively deals with Byzantine nodes, requiring only n 2f + 1, where n is the number of nodes and f is the number of Byzantine nodes in the system. The message complexity is reduced from O(n ) to O(n) with our proposed algorithm compared to broadcast-based algorithms.
