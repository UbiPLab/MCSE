AB In systems connected to smart grids, smart meters with fast and efficient responses are very helpful in detecting anomalies in realtime. However, sending data with a frequency of a minute or less is not normal with today's technology because of the bottleneck of the communication network and storage media. Because mitigation cannot be done in realtime, we propose prediction techniques using Deep Neural Network (DNN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). In addition to these techniques, the prediction timestep is chosen per day and wrapped in sliding windows, and clustering using Kmeans and intersection Kmeans and HDBSCAN is also evaluated. The predictive ability applied here is to predict whether anomalies in electricity usage will occur in the next few weeks. The aim is to give the user time to check their usage and from the utility side, whether it is necessary to prepare a sufficient supply. We also propose the latency reduction to counter higher latency as in the traditional centralized system by adding layer Edge Meter Data Management System (MDMS) and Cloud-MDMS as the inference and training model. Based on the experiments when running in the Raspberry Pi, the best solution is choosing DNN that has the shortest latency 1.25 ms, 159 kB persistent file size, and at 128 timesteps.
