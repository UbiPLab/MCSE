AB With the development of network technology and cloud computing, data sharing is becoming increasingly popular, and many scholars have conducted in-depth research to promote its flourish. As the scale of data sharing expands, its privacy protection has become a hot issue in research. Moreover, in data sharing, the data is usually maintained in multiple parties, which brings new challenges to protect the privacy of these multi-party data. In this paper, we propose a trusted data sharing scheme using blockchain. We use blockchain to prevent the shared data from being tampered, and use the Paillier cryptosystem to realize the confidentiality of the shared data. In the proposed scheme, the shared data can be traded, and the transaction information is protected by using the (p, t)-threshold Paillier cryptosystem. We conduct experiments in cloud storage scenarios and the experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
