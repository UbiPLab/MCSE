AB With the rapid development of cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) technology, massive data raises and shuttles on the network every day. To ensure the confidentiality and utilization of these data, industries and companies users encrypt their data and store them in an outsourced party. However, simple adoption of encryption scheme makes the original lose its flexibility and utilization. To address these problems, the searchable encryption scheme is proposed. Different from traditional encrypted data search scheme, this paper focuses on providing a solution to search the data from one or more IoT device by comparing their underlying numerical values. We present a multi-client comparable search scheme over encrypted numerical data which supports range queries. This scheme is mainly designed for keeping the confidentiality and searchability of numeric data, it enables authorized clients to fetch the data from different data owners by a generated token. Furthermore, to rich the scheme's functionality, we exploit the idea of secret sharing to realize cross-domain search which improves the data's utilization. The proposed scheme has also been proven to be secure through a series of security games. Moreover, we conduct experiments to demonstrate that our scheme is more practical than the existed similar schemes and achieves a balance between functionality and efficiency.
