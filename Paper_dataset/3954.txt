AB Phenomenological constitutive equations contain material parameters which cannot be measured directly in the experiment. We address the problem of error-resistant parameter identification for models of large strain elasto-plasticity. The identification is based on tests with a heterogeneous stress state. A methodology is presented which allows us to assess the reliability of identification strategies in terms of their sensitivity to measurement errors. A vital part of the methodology is the mechanics-based metric in the space of material parameters. The measure of sensitivity is the size of a parameter cloud, computed using this metric. Efficient procedures of Monte Carlo type for computation of the parameter cloud are presented and discussed. The methodology is exemplified in terms of a model with combined nonlinear isotropic-kinematic hardening. First, for an aluminum alloy, non-monotonic torsion tests with different sample cross sections are analyzed. Second, for the identification of hardening parameters of steel, three different tension-compression samples are considered. In both examples, various combinations of tests are checked for sensitivity to measurement errors identifying best and worst combinations.
