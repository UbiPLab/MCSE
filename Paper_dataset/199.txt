AB Broadcasting plays a significant role for data dissemination in Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET). Many VANET services rely on broadcast communication mode to disseminate data packets over the network. However, due to high mobility of vehicles, it stills being a challenging task. In this paper, a BaaS (Broadcast as a Service ) broadcasting solution is proposed for VANET to disseminate the data efficiently to the vehicles in the network using cloud computing. Due to the limited storage and computing capacity of vehicles, all information about road traffic and the broadcasting protocol is both maintained and processed in the cloud. So, we introduce a new cloud assisted VANET (CAV) architecture organizing the different levels of communications between the VANET components and the cloud, as well as between the three cloud layers. The source vehicle broadcasts the message by requesting the best relay set from the nearby road side unit (RSU) which plays the role of intermediate to the cloud. To perform the message forwarding, the cloud provides cross layer services: infrastructure as a service for traffic data storage and relay set selection processing, and application layer service for communication with VANET entities. By integrating cloud services many broadcasting problems may be reduced such as the delay and link breakage.
