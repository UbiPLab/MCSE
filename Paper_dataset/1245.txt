AB A systematic and comprehensive review of security and privacy-preserving challenges in e-health solutions indicates various privacy preserving approaches to ensure privacy and security of electronic health records (EHRs) in the cloud. This paper highlights the research challenges and directions concerning cyber security to build a comprehensive security model for EHR. We carry an intensive study in the IEEE, Science Direct, Google Scholar, PubMed, and ACM for papers on EHR approach published between 2000 and 2018 and summarized them in terms of the architecture types as well as evaluation strategies. We surveyed, investigated, and reviewed various aspects of several articles and identified the following tasks: 1) EHR security and privacy; 2) security and privacy requirements of e-health data in the cloud; 3) EHR cloud architecture, and; 4) diverse EHR cryptographic and non-cryptographic approaches. We also discuss some crucial issues and the ample opportunities for advanced research related to security and privacy of EHRs. Since big data provide a great mine of information and knowledge in e-Health applications, serious privacy and security challenges that require immediate attention exist. Studies must focus on efficient comprehensive security mechanisms for EHR and also explore techniques to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of patients' information.
