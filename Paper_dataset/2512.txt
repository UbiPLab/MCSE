AB In big data era, too much ordinary information leakage may lead to the leakage of private information. Image search is widely used in many fields. Though there are many studies on image search, most of them are search in plaintext databases. In this paper, we study the image retrieval techniques over encrypted databases. A content-based retrieval scheme for encrypted images is proposed. In the scheme, a blind technique based on discrete logarithm problem is introduced to keep the privacy of feature vectors, and a novel retrieval way is used. This is a flexible scheme, which support fuzzy search. The client can control the search range. And in the search process, the contents of the original image will not be revealed.
