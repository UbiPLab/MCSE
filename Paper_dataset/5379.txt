AB Cloud computing has become mainstream in the last few years. Diverse services based on IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and app store models have been widely available to millions of users worldwide. At the same time, transparent computing (TC) has also gained strong interest in China. With the rapid development of IoT, increasing IoT devices will be deployed to provide information services for end users. As we are heading into the era of ambient computing, where end users are immersed in seamless computing devices and services, the boundary between cloud and devices is getting blurry, and more devices and services need to be securely managed. The existing service models that are defined for user-cloud interaction should be extended to serve more diverse and lightweight devices with nimble and fluid services. With this evolution trend, it is paramount for both cloud service providers and IoT service operators to manage the security and integrity of these services. In this article, we propose a new cloud service model, named block-stream as a service (BaaS), based on our previous study on TC. BaaS is nimbler than SaaS and has better security management than an app store. It is expected that this new cloud service model has great potential to support the vision of ambient computing and securely manage diverse applications on lightweight IoT devices.
