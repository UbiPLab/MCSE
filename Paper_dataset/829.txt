AB Public fog nodes extend cloud services for the Internet of Things (IoT) clients and smart devices to provide additional computation capabilities, storage space, and reduce latency and response time. The openness and pervasiveness of public fog nodes leads to the requirement of using trust models to ensure reliability, security, privacy, and meet the service-level agreements (SLAB). Conventional trust models for public fog nodes are centrally configured, deployed, and maintained considering security, privacy, and SLA requirements. However, these trust models enforce centralized governance policies across the system which leads towards the single-point-of-failure and single-point-of-compromise over IoT devices' and users' personal data. This paper proposes a decentralized trust model in order to maintain the reputation of publicly available fog nodes. The reputation is maintained considering users' opinions about their past interactions with the public fog nodes. The proposed trust model is designed using public Ethereum blockchain and smart contract technologies in order to enable decentralized trustworthy service provisioning between IoT devices and public fog nodes. The proposed approach is tested and evaluated in terms of security, performance, and cost. The results show that using blockchain for decentralized reputation management could become more advantageous when compared to the existing centralized trust models.
