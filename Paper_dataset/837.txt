AB Pipeline defect detection systems collect the videos from cameras of pipeline robots, however the systems always analyzed these videos by offline systems or humans to detect the defects of potential security threats. The existing systems tend to reach the limit in terms of data access anywhere, access security and video processing on cloud. There is in need of studying on a pipeline defect detection cloud system for automatic pipeline inspection. In this paper, we deploy the framework of a cloud based pipeline defect detection system, including the user management module, pipeline robot control module, system service module, and defect detection module. In the system, we use a role encryption scheme for video collection, data uploading, and access security, and propose a hybrid information method for defect detection. The experimental results show that our approach is a scalable and efficient defection detection cloud system.
