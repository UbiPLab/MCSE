AB The importance of Blockchain and IoT technology have been highlighted in various fields. These are not unaccustomed words anymore in our lives. Although the technologies are in the infancy step and are still many remaining technical challenges, there is no doubt that it will be one of the major parts of the future Internet. The efficiency and security of data transmission scheme have always been major issues in the legacy Internet, and a data transmission scheme for the future Internet, including 5G and IoT environment should also provide and support these issues. Consequently, we propose a new data transmission scheme to successfully support the future Internet environment. The proposed scheme, which is named as S-DTS (Secure Data Transmission Scheme), supports a distributed transmission and decentralized access control. The S-DTS utilizes 4 synchronization zones, which are IoT network zone, aggregation zone, mining zone, and management zone, and these zones are operated by the DPN (Delegated Proof of Node) mechanism. Furthermore, all nodes are categorized to the 3 node groups, LDTG (Low Delay Tolerance Group), MDTG (Medium Delay Tolerance Group), HDTG (High Delay Tolerance Group), to provide an efficient data transmission, and the data in each group will be transmitted in accordance with their own traffic attributes. The evaluation results of this scheme show that it is very suitable for massive IoT environment scenarios, and IoT devices can take advantage of safe and efficient transmission by using the delegated proof of node technique. In addition, the S-DTS might be adaptable for various computing and networking environment with big data, edge cloud and cloud computing, and autonomous networking.
