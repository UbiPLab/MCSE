AB JarvSis is a distributed scheduler capable to automate the execution of multiple heterogeneous tasks on IoT and Robotics applications by means of a modular and adaptable software architecture. JarvSis is designed to accept pluggable modules that make it adaptable to any devices, from simple sensors to complex robots, that, in turn, expose remote interfaces, i.e. Web-API, MQTT or ROS message bus. Through JarvSis, the developer can easily configure and deploy hierarchies of control tasks running in the Cloud and in the Fog in order to interact and control IoT devices or robots that operate in the ground. Control tasks are organized in a hierarchical network on which Fog resources represent a bridge between the computational resources hosted in the Cloud, and IoT devices or robots operating in the "ground". In such a network, the highest layer provides control and coordination, and is typically hosted in the Cloud, while the last layer is distributed in the Fog. The advantages provided by JarvSis are discussed by a detailed example in the robotic domain.
