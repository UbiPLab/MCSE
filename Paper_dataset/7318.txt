AB The concepts of cloud and service-oriented computing provide users with tremendous opportunities for arranging a large variety of services to accomplish desired tasks. At the same time, accessing service clouds for fast development in mobile devices has made it a typical instrument. However, the usage of mobile devices and accessing service clouds can be affected for the limited battery power. Power management is an important issue for mobile devices. We have proposed a mechanism for the enhancement of the quality of service in mobile cloud computing to predict performance of a set of cloud service modes before selecting a service mode and to select the best service mode based on previous prediction results.
