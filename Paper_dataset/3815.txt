The authors identify the main problems of the cloud computing market in Ukraine and options for their solutions by implementing an innovative concept of the public cloud platform. The athors of the article have researched the cloud computing market in Ukraine, the role of the state in developing the abovementioned market and building innovative public cloud platform as a centralised data center which will enable the state to provide all public services and innovative services.
   The main idea of the concept of building an innovation public platform is the creation of a hybrid cloud which will integrate suppliers and consumers of information products and services, investors in the IT sector and mechanisms for sharing and protecting of information.
   The study shows that the concept of cloud computing is not only technological innovation in IT, but also a way to create new business models, when small manufacturers of IT products, including in the regions, have an opportunity to quickly offer the market their services and realise their business ideas. Public support for cloud computing, along with investments in young companies throughout the country, will quickly create an ecosystem of innovative productions.
   The implementation of the concept of a state-owned innovative cloud platform is a legitimate step towards the development of the ICT industry and an innovative economy in Ukraine.
