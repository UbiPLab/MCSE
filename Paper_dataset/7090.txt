AB In order to streamline government's internal decision making process that may be conducive to obtaining non-refundable European funds, this paper proposes new and intelligent methods for reporting, collecting and processing data in an updated manner, taken from websites of Eligible Competent Authorities to conduct such funds. Retrieving data will be made by means of intelligent mobile agents residing on the contracting public authority servers. Such data are processed in the cloud to generate reports or graphs, with the aim of measuring the EU FUNDS absorption rate at a certain time with a view to finding the best decisions that can increase EU funds absorption rate at national level and in the same time provide, ahead of time, the necessary budgetary funds for co-financing the European projects that have been undertaken.
