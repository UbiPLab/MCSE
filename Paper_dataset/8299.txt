AB This paper describes a trusted update mechanism of node authorization based on proxy re-encrypted in IoT cloud. It defines that the system consists of IoT data server, node authorization management server, re-encrypted proxy server and working node. The data is generated by trusted IoT data server through wireless sensor network. The network publishes to the node, which requires the node to register in the node authorization management server. The registered node will obtain the ciphertext data in the re-encrypted proxy server in the cloud, and obtain the decryption parameters in the node authorization management server for data decryption. This paper designs a secure and efficient cloud data sharing protocol, which satisfies the security of adaptive selection ciphertext, ensures the security of data storage and sharing, and also has the characteristics of unidirectionality, universality, non-interaction, non-transferability and anti-collusion attack. This paper also analyzes the computing and communication costs of data owners, cloud service provider (CSP) and data receivers under the data sharing protocol. The results show that in the cloud data sharing protocol based on this scheme, the data owner's one-time communication cost is 2368 bits, which is better than several comparison schemes and can meet the practical application requirements.
