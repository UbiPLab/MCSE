AB In recent years, users have been buying computing resources, such as VM instances, from the cloud resource providers. However, every cloud has its pricing models, solutions, and interfaces. Without a united interface, it is hard to manage across different clouds. To make things worse, it is even hard to select proper VM instances among multiple cloud resource providers when the resources are not sufficient. This paper proposes an interconnected cloud of selecting VM instances based on the job's deadline constraint. To make the system function, five agents are created for different purposes: a System Monitoring Agent, a Job Dispatching Agent, an Instance Group Managing Agent, an Instance Group Administrating Agent, and a Job Executing Agent. This paper also presents two decision algorithms, the Job Dispatching Algorithm and the Instance Group Invocation Algorithm, based on the Rough Set Theory, the jobs' deadline constraint, and the computing resource of the VM instances. The proposed system was deployed and evaluated on the real machines. The result shows not only the VM instances on different machines are interconnected, but also the algorithms successfully help manage the interconnected cloud's computing resources according to the submitted jobs with deadline constraints.
