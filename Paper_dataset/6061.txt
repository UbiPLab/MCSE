AB Several cloud services with comparable functionality are now available to customers at different prices and performance levels. Often, there may be trade-offs among different functional and non-functional requirements fulfilled by different cloud providers. Hence, it is difficult to evaluate the relative performances of the cloud services and their ranking based on various quality of service attributes. In this paper, we propose a modified data envelopment analysis and a modified super-efficiency data envelopment analysis for evaluating the cloud services and their efficiencies considering user preferences. We compare these methods of cloud service selection based on sensitivity analysis, adequacy to changes in DMUs, adequacy to support decision making and modeling of uncertainty. The comparison helps customers to choose a cloud service that is most suitable to their requirements and also creates a healthy competition among the cloud service providers.
