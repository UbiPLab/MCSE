AB Because of their unique electronic, magnetic and optical features, the rare earth has become an important strategic resource. Moreover, improving the exploitation of rare earth resources is very significant. To our knowledge, for the first time the hierarchical clustering technology under Map Reduce environment is utilized to process the experiment data of the tailings of rare earth ion in this paper. According to analyze of the experiment data, the leaching trend of rare earth ions in tailings under optimum conditions is researched. Finally, the data analysis shows that when the volume of sampling location is 400 ml, it can not only increase the concentration of rare earth ions in the leaching solution to ensure the economy and maneuverability of subsequent rare earth enrichment, but also insure the leaching rate of rare earth in the tailings and improve the utilization ratio of rare earth resources.
