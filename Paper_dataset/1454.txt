AB This paper reviews how to approach intelligent health services, exploring the requirements to achieve them. The following concepts are briefly presented: (1) The Internet of Things (IoT) as an important source for the future of health care services; (2) intelligent element technology and, in particular, the characteristics and benefits of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Devices; (3) the basic notions in Cloud Computing and its benefits in healthcare. In addition, concepts and features for smart health services are presented, followed by a proposal for a framework for a smart Cloud-based health system that illustrates the scope of electronic healthcare through the adoption of WSN-RFID intelligent objects.
