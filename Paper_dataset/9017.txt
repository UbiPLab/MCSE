AB In recent years, an increasing number of businesses have come to rely on public cloud computing, employing multiple cloud systems (multi-cloud) simultaneously. Also spreading widely among these multi-cloud operating companies is what is called shadow IT, which refers to public cloud services contracted directly by each department outside the official framework of the organization's systems for less red tape and greater speed. Such use of shadow IT may compromise the organization's governance of information and communications technology (ICT), and differences in specifications and usability between clouds can give rise to issues such as increased operational workload and operational complexity. To address these challenges, Fujitsu offers FUJITSU Cloud Services Management, a service that allows users to integrate multi-cloud management. It provides features and portal sites designed for a multi-cloud environment to centrally manage enterprise-wide usage, contracts and costs. This solution helps enhance ICT governance and optimize ICT operation and spending. This paper presents some of the challenges pertaining to multi-cloud environments, and describes the solutions our service offers.
