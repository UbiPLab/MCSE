AB The present work consists of an evaluation of the didactic-pedagogical potential of the use of Digital Information and Communication Technologies (TDICs) in the teaching-learning process in Geography classes in integrated courses of the federal network of scientific and technological professional education. The insertion of the use of the TDICs in the teaching plans and their use with classes of the first years provided a reflection on the current way that the students realize the acquisition of school knowledge and the way in which this mediation occurs. For the accomplishment of this research, a cut in the programmatic content of the discipline of Geography I was used, selecting the contents related to Cartography to be developed during the bimester. The activities were conducted in a computer lab. It is concluded that the use of online tools of Webcartography, cloud computing and collaborative construction of school work motivated the students to participate more actively in the proposed activities, thus evidencing the great potential in the forms of mediation and acquisition of knowledge.
