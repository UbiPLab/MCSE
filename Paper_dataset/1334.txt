AB Even though, cloud computing reduces the operating cost by enabling adaptation of virtual machines, it has suffered in selection of optimal virtual machine due to shortage of resource or resource wastage, sudden changes in requirement so it requires optimal resource allocation. Resource allocation is the process of providing services and storage space to the particular task requested by the users. This is one of the important challenges in cloud computing environment and has variant level of issues like scheduling task, computational performance, reallocation, response time and cost efficiency. In this research work we introduce a three-phase scheduling method based on memory, energy and QOS in order to overcome the above issues which also yield low energy consumption, maximum storage and the high level Quality of Service (QoS). Biggest Memory First and Biggest Access First is introduced with NUMA scheduler and cache scheduler for memory scheduling and the optimal VM resulting from the three phases of scheduling is determined by Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm. To carry the security level of optimized VMs, Streamline Security and Introspection security analysis are exhausted for detecting the malware VMs which results the secured and efficient VMs for further resource allocation. Our proposed methodology is implemented using the Cloud Sim tool and the experimental result shows the efficiency of our proposed method in terms of security, time consumption, and cost.
