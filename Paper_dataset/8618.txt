AB Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have multiple uses and applications at the individual and organizations levels. Sensors are integrated in many fields including health, traffic, agriculture, industry, and many others. The use of sensors is associated with using many technologies including wireless communication protocols, Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, mobile computing, and other developing technologies. This interaction that involves transmission of vital information in many cases imposes the need to secure these data against any possible attacks. But securing the communication in Wireless Sensor Networks comes at high cost of the performance since the components in the WSNs are usually have limited computing and power capabilities. Securing information in this constrained environment requires light encryption algorithms since current public-key and private-key encryption algorithms involve huge computations. In this paper, we present and analyze lightweight cryptographic approaches because they are believed to be among the most adequate solutions for the security/performance trade-off in WSNs.
