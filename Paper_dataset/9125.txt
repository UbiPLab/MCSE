AB The Internet of Things (IoT), which enables common objects to be intelligent and interactive, is considered the next evolution of the Internet. Its pervasiveness and ability to collect and analyze data that can be converted into information have motivated a plethora of IoT applications. For the successful deployment and management of these applications, cloud computing techniques are indispensable since they provide high computational capabilities as well as large storage capacity. This article aims at providing insights about the architecture, implementation, and performance of the IoT cloud. Several potential application scenarios of IoT cloud are studied, and an architecture is discussed regarding the functionality of each component. Moreover, the implementation details of the IoT cloud are presented along with the services that it offers. The main contributions of this article lie in the combination of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) servers to offer IoT services in the architecture of the IoT cloud with various techniques to guarantee high performance. Finally, experimental results are given in order to demonstrate the service capabilities of the IoT cloud under certain conditions.
