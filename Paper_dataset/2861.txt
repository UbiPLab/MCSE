AB This work is conducted to solve the current problem in the attribute-based keyword search (ABKS) scheme about how to securely and efficiently delegate the search rights to other users when the authorized user is not online. We first combine proxy re-encryption (PRE) with the ABKS technology and propose a scheme called attribute-based keyword search with proxy re-encryption (PABKS). The scheme not only realizes the functions of data search and fine-grained access control, but also supports search function sharing. In addition, we randomly blind the user's private key to the server, which ensures the confidentiality and security of the private key. Then, we also prove that the scheme is selective access structure and chosen keyword attack (IND-sAS-CKA) secured in the random oracle model. A performance analysis and security proof show that the proposed scheme can achieve efficient and secure data search in the cloud.
