AB Cloud computing is one of the most popular and pragmatic topics of research nowadays. The allocation of cloudlet(s) to suitable VM(s) is one of the most challenging areas of research in the domain of cloud computing. This paper highlights a new cloudlet allocation algorithm which improves the performance of a cloud service provider (CSP) in comparison with the other existing cloudlet allocation algorithms. The proposed Range wise Busy-checking 2-way Balanced (RB2B) cloudlet allocation algorithm optimizes few basic parameters associated with the performance analysis. An extensive simulation is done to evaluate the proposed algorithm using Cloudsim to attest its efficacy in comparison to the other existing allocation policies. (C) 2016 The Authors.
