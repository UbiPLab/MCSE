AB We investigate the optimization of energy consumption in Mobile Cloud environment in this paper. In order to optimize the energy consumed by the CPUs in mobile devices, we put forward using the asymptotic time complexity (ATC) method to distinguish the computational complexities of the applications when they are executed in mobile devices. We propose a multi-scale scheme to quantize the channel gain and provide an improved dynamic transmission scheduling algorithm when offloading the applications to the cloud center, which has been proved to be helpful for reducing the mobile devices energy consumption. We give the energy estimation methods in both mobile execution model and cloud execution model. The numerical results suggest that energy consumed by the mobile devices can be remarkably saved with our proposed multi-scale scheme. Moreover, the results can be used as a guideline for the mobile devices to choose whether executing the application locally or offloading it to the cloud center.
