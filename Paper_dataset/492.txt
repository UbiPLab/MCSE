AB Reasonable allocation of storage and computing resources is the basis of building big data system. With the development of IoT (Internet of Things), more data will be brought. A three-layer architecture includes smart devices layer, edge cloud layer and blockchain-based distributed cloud layer. Blockchain is used in IoT for building a distributed decentralize P2P architecture to deal with the secure issue while edge computing deals with increasing volume of data. Edge caching is one of the important application scenarios. In order to allocate edge cache resources reasonably, to improve the quality of service and to reduce the waste of bandwidth resources, this paper proposes a content selection algorithm of edge cache nodes. The algorithm adopts markov chain model, improves the utilization of cache space and reduces the content transmission delay. The hierarchical caching strategy is adopted and the secondary cache stores slides of contents to expand the coverage of cached content and to reduce user waiting time. Regional node cooperation is adopted to expand the cache space and to support the regional preference of cache content. Compared with the classical substitution algorithm, simulation results show that the algorithm in this paper has higher cache hit ratio and higher space utilization.
