AB Nowadays, the advanced mobile devices provide considerable computation capacity. However, due to the instinct limitation of resources, mobile devices have to offload computation by Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) and Ad-Hoc Cloudlet for improving the performance and prolonging the battery life. However, efficient model for ad-hoc cloudlet-assisted computation offloading is remaining open issues. In this article, we provide an overview of existing computation offloading modes, e.g. remote cloud service mode and ad-hoc cloudlet-assisted service mode, and propose an opportunistic computation offloading (OPPOCO) to enable a more energy-efficient and intelligent strategy for computation offloading. Moreover, the simulation by OPNET verifies that our proposal is available and practical to improve mobile users' Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE).
