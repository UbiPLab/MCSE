AB In the context of emerging technologies, Cloud Computing (CC) was introduced as a new paradigm to host and deliver Information Technology Services. Cloud computing is a new model for delivering resources. However, there are many critical problems appeared with cloud computing, such as data privacy, security, and reliability, etc. But security is the most important between these problems. Biometric identification is a reliable and one of the easiest ways to recognize a person using extractable characteristics. In addition, a biometric application requires a fast and powerful processing systems, hence the increased use of embedded systems in biometric applications especially in image processing. Embedded systems have a wide variety and the choice of a well-designed processor is one of the most important factors that directly affect the overall performance of the system. This study highlights the performance of the Texas Instrument DSP for processing a biometric fingerprint recognition system.
