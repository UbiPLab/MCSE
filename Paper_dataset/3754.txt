AB We investigate here the excitation of methylidene (CH) induced by collisions with atomic and molecular hydrogen (H and H-2). The hyperfine-resolved rate coefficients were obtained from close coupling nuclear-spin-free scattering calculations. The calculations are based upon recent, high-accuracy calculations of the CH(X-2 Pi)-H(S-2) and CH(X-2 Pi)- H-2 potential energy surfaces. Cross-sections and rate coefficients for collisions with atomic H, para-H-2, and ortho-H-2 were computed for all transitions between the 32 hyperfine levels for CH(X-2 Pi) involving the n <= 4 rotational levels for temperatures between 10 and 300 K. These rate coefficients should significantly aid in the interpretation of astronomical observations of CH spectra. As a first application, the excitation of CH is simulated for conditions in typical molecular clouds.
