ID COMPUTING MOTIVATION
AB Cloud storages can be used to solve limited storage on mobile devices. The stored data can be reached from anywhere if network access is available. Network access can be costly, especially for mobile devices, which have limited power source. One of the solutions to reduce the amount of data transfer is data deduplication. This paper proposes a deduplication system called Smart Deduplication for Mobiles (SDM) for mobile devices. SDM chooses the best deduplication method without specific configurations for any file type. We compared our system to existing deduplication systems available on mobile devices. Results show that SDM achieves higher deduplication accuracy and faster deduplication speed over existing systems for mobile devices with negligible additional time in most scenarios. The additional time required by our system is negligible when compared to the power saved from uploading fewer data to a cloud storage. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
