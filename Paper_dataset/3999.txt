AB The software-as-a-service layer of cloud computing has evolved much interest among the researchers in the academic and industry worlds. It is based on service-oriented architectures and web service (WS) technology, which are used to offer a remotely accessible application. When a single WS is unable to satisfy all the customer's requirements, a WS composition (WSC) method is applied to connect together various available WSs for building distributed application, using discovery, compatibility checking, selection, and deployment steps. This paper has two-fold contributions: The major one is the proposition of a new algorithm based on minimally unsatisfiable subset formal algorithm to compose WSs. This contribution ensures a faster WSC, which is prominent in an online context. The second contribution is the proposition of a new penalty-based genetic algorithm to identify near-optimal solutions whenever an exact one is not identified using our formal algorithm. Indeed, in some cases, many available WSs provide overlapping/identical functionality; in this context, the choice of participated services is given using quality of service. This work proposes a WSC ensuring to find out an exact or a near-optimal solution according to the user need. A set of experimentations is applied to validate our contributions.
