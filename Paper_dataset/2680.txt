AB With the significant advances in communication technologies and in many other sectors, also are growing up security and privacy issues. In our research, is introduced a base technology called Cloud Computing (CC) to operate with the Big Data (BD). CC is a technology which refers to the processing power of data in the fog, providing more "green" computational and sustainable computing. Since it is a recently investigated technology, it has many gaps in security and privacy. So, in this paper, we proposed a new system for Cloud Computing integrated with Internet of Things as a base scenario for Big Data. Moreover, we tried to establish an architecture relaying on the security of the network in order to improve the security issues. A solution proposed is installing a security "wall" between the Cloud Server and the Internet, with the aim to eliminate the privacy and security issues. As a result, we consider that CC deals more efficient with the privacy issue of bits transferred through time. Through our proposed system, the interaction and cooperation between things and objects communicate through the wireless networks in order to fulfil the objective set to them as a combined entity. Regarding the major goal of our research, which is the security, a sort survey of IoT and CC presented, with a focus on the security issues of both technologies. In addition to this, we try present the security challenges of the integration of IoT and Cloud Computing with the aim to provide an architecture relaying on the security of the network in order to improve their security issues. Finally, we realize that through our study Cloud Computing could offer a more "green" and efficient fog environment for sustainable computing scenarios.
