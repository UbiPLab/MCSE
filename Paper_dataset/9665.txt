AB Cloud computing is an upcoming and promising solution for utility computing that provides resources on demand. As it has grown into a business model, a large number of cloud service providers exist today in the cloud market, which further is expanding exponentially. Many cloud service providers, with almost similar functionality, pose a selection problem to the cloud users. To assist the users in the best service selection, as per its requirement, a framework has been developed in which users list their quality of service (QoS) expectation, while service providers express their offerings. Experience of the existing cloud users is also taken into account in order to select the best cloud service provider. This work identifies some new QoS metrics, besides few existing ones, and defines it in a way that eases both the user and the provider to express their expectations and offers, respectively, in a quantified manner. Further, a dynamic and flexible model, using a variant of ranked voting method, is proposed that considers users' requirement and suggests the best cloud service provider. Case studies affirm the correctness and the effectiveness of the proposed model. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
