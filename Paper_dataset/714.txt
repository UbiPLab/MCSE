AB According to the statistics provided by the World Health Organization, the number of people suffering from visual impairment is approximately 1.3 billion. The number of blind and visually impaired people is expected to increase over the coming years, and it is estimated to triple by the end of 2050 which is quite alarming. Keeping the needs and problems faced by the visually impaired people in mind, we have come up with a technological solution that is a "Smart Cane device" that can help people having sight impairment to navigate with ease and to avoid the risk factors surrounding them. Currently, the three main options available for blind people are using a white cane, technological tools and guide dogs. The solution that has been proposed in this article is using various technological tools to come up with a smart solution to the problem to facilitate the users' life. The designed system mainly aims to facilitate indoor navigation using cloud computing and Internet of things (IoT) wireless scanners. The goal of developing the Smart Cane can be achieved by integrating various hardware and software systems. The proposed solution of a Smart Cane device aims to provide smooth displacement for the visually impaired people from one place to another and to provide them with a tool that can help them to communicate with their surrounding environment.
