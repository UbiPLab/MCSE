AB Latency minimization is a pivotal aspect in provision of real time services while adhering to Quality of Experience (QoE) parameters for assuring spectral efficiency. Edge Cloud Computing, being a potential research dimension in the realm of 5G networks, targets to enhance the network efficiency by harnessing effectiveness of both cloud computing and mobile devices in user's proximity. Keeping in view the far ranging impact of Edge Cloud Computing in future mobile generations, a comprehensive review of the prevalent Edge Cloud Computing frameworks and approaches is presented with a detailed comparison of its classifications through various QoS metrics (pertinent to network performance and overheads associated with deployment/migration). Considering the knowledge accumulated, procedures analysed and theories discussed, the paper provides a comprehensive overview on sate-of-the-art and future research directions for multi-access mobile edge computing.
