AB As the integration of the Internet of Vehicles and social networks, vehicular social networks (VSN) not only improves the efficiency and reliability of vehicular communication environment, but also provide more comprehensive social services for users. However, with the emergence of advanced communication and computing technologies, more and more data can be fast and conveniently collected from heterogeneous devices, and VSN has to meet new security challenges such as data security and privacy protection. Searchable encryption (SE) as a promising cryptographic primitive is devoted to data confidentiality without sacrificing data searchability. However, most existing schemes are vulnerable to the adaptive leakage-exploiting attacks or can not meet the efficiency requirements of practical applications, especially the searchable public-key encryption schemes (SPE). To achieve secure and efficient keyword search in VSN, we design a new blockchain-based searchable public-key encryption scheme with forward and backward privacy (BSPEFB). BSPEFB is a decentralized searchable public-key encryption scheme since the central search cloud server is replaced by the smart contract. Meanwhile, BSPEFB supports forward and backward privacy to achieve privacy protection. Finally, we implement a prototype of our basic construction and demonstrate the practicability of the proposed scheme in applications.
