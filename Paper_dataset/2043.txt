ID NUMERICAL-SIMULATION
AB We present a direct Lagrangian simulation that computes key warm-rain processes in a vertically developing cloud, including cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation, condensational growth, collisional growth, and droplet gravitational settling. This simulation, which tracks the motion and growth of individual particles, is applied to a kinematic simulation of an extremely vertically elongated quasi-one-dimensional domain, after which the results are compared with those obtained from a spectral-bin model, which adopts the conventional Eulerian framework. The comparison results, which confirm good bulk statistical agreement between the Lagrangian and conventional spectral-bin simulations, also show that the Lagrangian simulation is free from the numerical diffusion found in the spectral-bin simulation. After analyzing the Lagrangian statistics of the surface raindrops that reach the ground surface, back-trajectory scrutiny reveals that the Lagrangian statistics of surface raindrops contains the information about the sky where the raindrops grow like the shape does for snow crystals.
