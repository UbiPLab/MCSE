AB Content-based sensor search is a core application in the Internet of Things (IoT), where target sensors can be quickly found by predicting the current output of the sensors. Due to the lack of update mechanism, the established prediction model in existing search architectures will gradually become unavailable in the highly dynamic IoT environment. Hence, a dual prediction structure based on edge intelligence is proposed in this article, to maintain the performance of the prediction model with minimum communication cost in long-term prediction. To implement our architecture, a more effective online learning algorithm is proposed to update prediction models online combined with our proposed adaptive window pattern clustering (AWPC) algorithm. Meanwhile, based on the dual prediction scheme (DPS), a mechanism is deployed on edge sensors to achieve transfer decision making in our architecture, where edge computing is performed to achieve selectively reporting data. With the designed architecture, about 76.56% of the communication energy consumption could be saved while achieving a 95.47% average prediction accuracy in continuous long-term prediction.
