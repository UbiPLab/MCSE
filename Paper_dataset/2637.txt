AB The next generation of fifth generation (5G) network, implementing mobile edge computing (MEC), network function virtualization (NFV) and software defined networking technologies, establishes a flexible and resilient network in line with various internet of things (IoT) devices. While NFV adds flexibility scale in or out networks by allowing network functions to be dynamically deployed and inter-connected, MEC provide intelligence at the edge of a mobile network; reduces latency, and increases capacity. With the diverse development of networking applications, the proposed MEC with container-based virtualization technology (CVT) as IoT gateway with IoT devices for flow control mechanism in scheduling and analysis methods will effectively enhance the quality of service. In this work, the proposed IoT gateway will be analyzed to elucidate the combined effect of simultaneously deploying virtual network functions and MEC applications on the same network infrastructure. Low latency, high bandwidth and high agility, supporting the connection of large-scale devices, and the efficient combination of resources from network edge and cluster clouds, account for real-time network conditions, reducing the IoT applications and services to indicate that a number is the average of 30% of the latency, that could get more suitable service quality to develop such as both augmented reality and virtual reality application intelligence in coming 5G network.
