AB Cloud Computing is an evolving information technology paradigm that impacts many sectors in many countries. Although Cloud Computing is an emerging technology there is little in the literature concerning its application in the Saudi healthcare sector. This paper examines and identifies the factors that will influence the adoption of Cloud Computing in Saudi healthcare organisations. The study integrates the TOE (Technology-Organization-Environment) framework with the Information System Strategic Triangle (IS Triangle) and the HOT-fit (Human-Organization-Technology) model to provide a holistic evaluation of the determinants of Cloud Computing adoption in healthcare organisations. Of the five perspectives examined in this study, the Business perspective was found to be the most important followed by the Technology, Organisational and Environmental perspectives and finally the Human perspective. The findings of the study showed that the five most important factors influencing the adoption of Cloud Computing in this context are soft financial analysis, relative advantage, hard financial analysis, attitude toward change and pressure from partners in the business ecosystem. This study identifies the critical factors for both practitioners and academics that influence Cloud Computing adoption decision-making in Saudi healthcare.
