AB Cloud computing provides online services to customers using pay as you go model. The Cloud computing enables customers to outsource the large and complex tasks to the cloud data centers for the execution and result generations. Cloud data centers host the incoming tasks by providing resources, such as CPU, RAM, storage, and bandwidth. As the large data centers provide the basic resources to hosted tasks, they also consume a huge amount of energy, which leads to higher operating cost and CO2 traces. Therefore, research community felt the need to provide energy-efficient solutions that reduce the impact of the aforementioned issues. Consequently, researchers proposed many solutions, and majority of them are based upon the concept of consolidation. Consolidation techniques place the incoming tasks on minimum possible servers, thus increasing the resource utilization and decreasing energy consumption. In this paper, we use the same workload consolidation concept and present two techniques that reduce energy consumption while ensuring the negotiated quality-of-service. Moreover, we enhanced two existing techniques by improving the energy efficiency and introducing service level agreement (SLA) awareness to minimize the overall SLA violations. Performance evaluation of the proposed techniques is done based on fluctuating workloads, and results show that our techniques outperform existing techniques in terms of energy efficiency, SLA compliance, and performance assurance at the network level. Moreover, correctness of the proposed techniques is demonstrated by modeling and verifying them with the help of high-level Petri Nets, SMT-Lib, and Z3 solver.
