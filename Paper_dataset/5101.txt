ID PUBLIC-KEY ENCRYPTION; IDENTITY-BASED ENCRYPTION; KEYWORD SEARCH
AB With the advent of cloud computing, data privacy has become one of critical security issues and attracted much attention as more and more mobile devices are relying on the services in cloud. To protect data privacy, users usually encrypt their sensitive data before uploading to cloud servers, which renders the data utilization to be difficult. The ciphertext retrieval is able to realize utilization over encrypted data and searchable public key encryption is an effective way in the construction of encrypted data retrieval. However, the previous related works have not paid much attention to the design of ciphertext retrieval schemes that are secure against inside keyword-guessing attacks (KGAs). In this paper, we first construct a new architecture to resist inside KGAs. Moreover we present an efficient ciphertext retrieval instance with a designated tester (dCRKS) based on the architecture. This instance is secure under the inside KGAs. Finally, security analysis and efficiency comparison show that the proposal is effective for the retrieval of encrypted data in cloud computing.
