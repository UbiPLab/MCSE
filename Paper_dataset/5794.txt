AB The Cloud Computing attacks have been increased since the expanded use of the cloud computing. One of the famous attacks that targets the cloud computing is the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. The common features and component of the cloud structure make it more reachable from this kind of attack. The DDOS is targeting the large number of devices connected in any cloud service provider based on its scalability and reliability features that make the cloud available from anywhere and anytime. This attack mainly generate a large number of malicious packets to make the targeted server busy dealing with these huge number of packets. There many techniques to defend the DDOS attack in the regular networks, while in the cloud computing this task is more complicated regarding the various characteristics of the cloud that make the defending process not an easy task. This paper will investigate most of the method used in detecting and preventing and then recover from the DDoS in the cloud computing environment.
