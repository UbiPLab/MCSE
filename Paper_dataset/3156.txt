AB Land Use/Cover Change (LUCC) detection relies increasingly on comparing remote sensing images with different spatial and spectral scales. Based on scale-invariant image analysis algorithms in computer vision, we propose a scale-invariant LUCC detection method to identify changes from scale heterogeneous images. This method is composed of an entropy-based spatial decomposition, two scale invariant feature extraction methods, Maximally Stable Extremal Region (MSER) and Scale-Invariant Feature Transformation (SIFT) algorithms, a spatial regression voting method to integrate MSER and SIFT results, a Markov Random Field-based smoothing method, and a support vector machine classification method to assign LUCC labels. We test the scale invariance of our new method with a LUCC case study in Montreal, Canada, 2005-2012. We found that the scale-invariant LUCC detection method provides similar accuracy compared with the resampling-based approach but this method avoids the LUCC distortion incurred by resampling.
