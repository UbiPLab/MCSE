AB Cloud data centers often schedule heterogeneous workloads without considering energy consumption and carbon emission aspects. Tremendous amount of energy consumption leads to high operational costs and reduces return on investment and contributes towards carbon footprints to the environment. Therefore, there is need of energy-aware cloud based system which schedules computing resources automatically by considering energy consumption as an important parameter. In this paper, energy efficient autonomic cloud system [Self-Optimization of Cloud Computing Energy-efficient Resources (SOCCER)] is proposed for energy efficient scheduling of cloud resources in data centers. The proposed work considers energy as a Quality of Service (QoS) parameter and automatically optimizes the efficiency of cloud resources by reducing energy consumption. The performance of the proposed system has been evaluated in real cloud environment and the experimental results show that the proposed system performs better in terms of energy consumption of cloud resources and utilizes these resources optimally.
