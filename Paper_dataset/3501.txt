ID ENCRYPTION
AB CVCC, a hybrid technology to exploit the computing resources among the cloud, roadside infrastructure, and vehicles, has received considerable attention in recent years. Different from traditional cloud computing, CVCC additionally makes use of underutilized vehicular resources, which can make rich applications and services possible even when neither cloud nor roadside infrastructure is available. CVCC is popular today; however, the security and privacy issues are still the main obstacle in CVCC for its full implementation. To deal with security and privacy challenges, advanced cryptographic primitives have become indispensable parts of CVCC. Among them, the pairing-based cryptographic primitive is of particular interest. However, the pairing computation is usually time-consuming. Therefore, it is beneficial for vehicles to outsource pairing computations especially when the underlying pairing computations are massively needed. In this article, we devote our attention toward the security challenges and efficiency requirements of outsourcing pairing from vehicles to vehicles in CVCC. Specifically, we give a pairing outsourcing protocol for illustration, which indicates that secure and effective pairing outsourcing in CVCC is possible. Furthermore, we also identify some future research directions in secure CVCC.
