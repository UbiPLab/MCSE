AB This paper analyzes the long-term impact of a case concerning an internet broadcast retransmission service called RecordTV from Singapore in comparison to the case of Aereo, where the Supreme Court found the broadcast live streaming service directly liable for copyright infringement. Scholars and industry professionals for and against Aereo predicted at different times that a ruling for the opposing side would undermine all local broadcasting, act as cloud computing's death knell or would have some other adverse effect on broadcasting or innovation. By comparing the cases and their consequences, this paper aims to describe the unexpected real-world effects of permitting a third-party internet retransmission service to "free the airwaves."
