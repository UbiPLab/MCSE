ID PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION
AB One of the requirements of QoS-aware service composition in cloud computing environment is that it should be executed on-the-fly. It requires a trade-off between optimality and the execution speed of service composition. In line with this purpose, many researchers used combinatorial methods in previous works to achieve optimality within the shortest possible time. However, due to the ever-increasing number of services which leads to the enlargement of the search space of the problem, previous methods do not have adequate efficiency in composing the required services within reasonable time. In this paper, genetic algorithm was used to achieve global optimization with regard to service level agreement. Moreover, service clustering was used for reducing the search space of the problem, and association rules were used for a composite service based on their histories to enhance service composition efficiency. The conducted experiments acknowledged the higher efficiency of the proposed method in comparison with similar related works.
