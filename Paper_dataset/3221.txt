AB In the recent years, the optical networks have grown to unexpected dimensions. The growth of active users and growing demand for data services set high requirements to network providers. Driving forces of this growth are multimedia, cloud computing and web services which set high bandwidth demand. The majority of currently deployed optical networks utilize passive or active network structure using dominantly singlemode optical fiber (SMF). SMF is believed to be the better choice over multimode optical fiber (MMF) for high speed optical fiber communication systems. And in some applications it definitely is. MMF has found use especially for short distance communication as it easily supports distances required for interconnecting buildings, data centres or campuses. Considering MMFs lower cost over SMF it became an interesting alternative for Ethernet connection in buildings or campuses. In this paper we present a simulation model of 1000BASE-LX Ethernet with MMF using different optical modulation techniques. The aim of this article is to demonstrate possibilities of MMF based 1000BASE-LX Ethernet with directly modulated vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL).
