AB The manufacturing industry represents a data rich environment, in which larger and larger volumes of data are constantly being generated by its processes. However, only a relatively small portion of it is actually taken advantage of by manufacturers. As such, the proposed Intelligent Data Analysis and Real-Time Supervision (IDARTS) framework presents the guidelines for the implementation of scalable, flexible and pluggable data analysis and real-time supervision systems for manufacturing environments. IDARTS is aligned with the current Industry 4.0 trend, being aimed at allowing manufacturers to translate their data into a business advantage through the integration of a Cyber-Physical System at the edge with cloud computing. It combines distributed data acquisition, machine learning and run-time reasoning to assist in fields such as predictive maintenance and quality control, reducing the impact of disruptive events in production.
