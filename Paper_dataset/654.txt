AB A huge amount of information is expected to be exchanged in vehicular networks through vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications for enhancing overall traffic efficiency and road safety. However, there are several critical challenges to be addressed before completely realizing the full potential of V2X networking. Privacy-aware security is one of the central components to be addressed for V2X communications. This paper presents a novel framework by leveraging the best features of two emerging technologies: blockchain technology and named data networking (NDN) for privacy-aware secure V2X communications. The proposed framework does not use the private information of users (owners, drivers, pedestrians, passengers, cyclists, etc.) in vehicular networks while providing verifiable secure V2X communications by using non-private information such as number plate of the vehicle (like in ParkMobile App or E-ZPass systems use) for integrity and accountability of the communications. Specifically, integrity and accountability in the proposed framework for its users are achieved by amalgamating the best features of blockchain technology and NDN. Furthermore, the proposed approach aims to increase the trust and transparency and reduce the business friction in smart transplantation systems.
