ID SECURITY
AB With the invention of new communication technologies, new features and facilities are provided in a smart healthcare framework. The features and facilities aim to provide a seamless, easy-to-use, accurate, and real-time healthcare service to clients. As health is a sensitive issue, it should be taken care of with utmost security and caution. This article proposes a new medical image forgery detection system for the healthcare framework to verify that images related to healthcare are not changed or altered. The system works on a noise map of an image, applies a multi-resolution regression filter on the noise map, and feeds the output to support-vector-machine-based and extreme-learning-based classifiers. The noise map is created in an edge computing resource, while the filtering and classification are done in a core cloud computing resource. In this way, the system works seamlessly and in real time. The bandwidth requirement of the proposed system is also reasonable.
