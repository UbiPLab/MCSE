AB We study a downlink distributed MIMO system where a central unit (CU) broadcasts messages to K' users through K distributed BSs. The CU is connected to the BSs via K independent rate-constrained fronthaul (FH) links. The distributed BSs collectively serve the users through the air. We propose a new network coding based distributed MIMO broadcasting scheme, using reverse compute-and-forward and signal-space alignment. At the CU, a network coding generator matrix is employed for pre network coding of the users' messages. The network coded messages are forwarded to the BSs, where the FH rate-constraint determines the actual number of network-coded messages forwarded to the BSs. At the BSs, linear precoding matrices are designed to create a number of bins, each containing a bunch of spatial streams with aligned signal-spaces. At each user, post physical-layer network coding is employed to compute linear combinations over the NC messages with respect to the bins, which reverses the prenetwork coding and recovers the desired messages. We derive an achievable rate of the proposed scheme based on the existence of NC generator matrix, signal-space alignment precoding matrices, and nested lattice codes. Improved rate and degrees of freedom over existing interference alignment and compress-and-forward schemes are shown. Numerical results demonstrate the performance improvement, e.g., by as much as 70% increase in throughput over benchmark schemes.
