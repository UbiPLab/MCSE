AB The purpose of this paper is to investigate the main determinants (criteria as well as sub-criteria) influencing the adoption decision of cloud computing (CC) in the healthcare sector. In the present study, qualitative interviews and the Delphi method are used to find the relevance of identified determinants (criteria and sub-criteria) from literature. Further, an integrated hybrid approach of interpretive structural modeling, analytic hierarchy process, and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (ISM-AHP-TOPSIS) have been employed to identify interrelationships among criteria, rank critical criteria as well as subcriteria, and find the most suitable cloud service provider (CSP) respectively. This study analyses seven criteria and twenty-one sub-criteria that offers a roadmap to decision-makers before CC-adoption (CCA). The analysis of ISM and AHP revealed technology as the most critical and human-environment as the least critical criteria. The vital sub-criteria associated with each criterion are Management Strategic Planning (under Organisation), Government Policy (External Environment), Security (Technology), Financing of IT in Hospital (Economic), Perceived Visibility (Social), and Attitude of Colleagues about Cloud Computing (Human Environment). The results from TOPSIS revealed CSP5 being the most suitable service provider followed by CSP2. Finally, this research makes methodological contribution in terms of an integrated hybrid method, to select a suitable CSP for the healthcare sector and the theoretical contribution in terms of criteria & sub-criteria. This article answers an important question, i.e., whether the benefits of CCA outweighs its barriers, thereby exploring the potential (and future) of CC for the advancement of healthcare provision.
