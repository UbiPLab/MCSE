AB The mobile fog computing (MFC) network that integrates unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) fully exerts its advantages of flexible deployment, load balance, and rapid response. Under complex network environment, proposing a reasonable offloading model and according resource optimization of the MFC network is important to satisfy high-requirement offloading standard. In this paper, a multilevel MFC offloading model where UAV and fog nod undertake relay nodes and offloading computing nodes are established for computation-intensive and latency-critical tasks, considering heterogeneous network selection , dynamic channel quality and central cloud access . With the total system utility optimality function including reward function maximization as the goal, the MDP algorithm is applied to solve the best offloading decision of the computing task and the balanced load mode of the MFC network. Finally, the simulation section verifies the excellent performance of the proposed multilevel MFC offloading model in network resource utilization. Simulation results show that the model can optimize the relative position of service nodes in MFC network and ensure the offloading reliability of terminal equipment.
