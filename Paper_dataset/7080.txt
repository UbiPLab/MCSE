ID FULLY HOMOMORPHIC ENCRYPTION; DATABASE
AB Cloud computing is an attractive solution that can provide low cost storage and powerful processing capabilities for government agencies or enterprises of small and medium size. Yet the confidentiality of information should be considered by any organization migrating to cloud, which makes the research on relational database system based on encryption schemes to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of data in cloud be an interesting subject. So far there have been various solutions for realizing SQL queries on encrypted data in cloud without decryption in advance, where generally homomorphic encryption algorithm is applied to support queries with aggregate functions or numerical computation. But the existing homomorphic encryption algorithms cannot encrypt floating-point numbers. So in this paper, we present a mechanism to enable the trusted party to encrypt the floating-points by homomorphic encryption algorithm and partial trusty server to perform summation on their ciphertexts without revealing the data itself. In the first step, we encode floating-point numbers to hide the decimal points and the positive or negative signs. Then, the codes of floating-point numbers are encrypted by homomorphic encryption algorithm and stored as sequences in cloud. Finally, we use the data structure of Double List Tree to implement the aggregate function of SUM and later do some extra processes to accomplish the summation.
