AB Due to the advancement of technology, devices generate huge working files at a rapid rate. These data, which are of considerable scale and are created very fast, can be called big data. Keeping such files in one storage device is impossible. Therefore, a large file size is recommended for storage in a cloud storage service. Although this concept is a solution to solve the storage problem, it still faces challenges in terms of reliability and security. The main issues are the unreliability of single cloud storage when its service is down, and the risk of insider attack from the storage service. Therefore, this paper proposes a file sharing scheme that increases both the reliability of the file fragments using a multi-cloud storage system and decreases the risk from insider attack. The dew computing concept is used as a contributor to the file-sharing scheme. The working file is split into fragments. Each fragment is deployed to cloud storage services, one fragment per one cloud provider manner. The dew server controls users' access and monitors the availability of fragments. Finally, we verify the proposed scheme in aspects of the downloading performance, and security.
