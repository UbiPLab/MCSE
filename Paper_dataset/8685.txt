AB Fog computing (FC) is currently receiving a great deal of focused attention. FC can be viewed as an extension of cloud computing that services the edges of networks. A cooperative relationship among applications to collect data in a city is a fundamental research topic in FC. When considering the green cloud, people or vehicles with smart-sensor devices can be viewed as users in FC and can forward sensing data to the data center. In a traditional sensing process, rewards are paid according to the distances between the users and the platform, which can be seen as the existing solution. Because users with smart-sensing devices tend to participate in tasks with high rewards, the number of users in suburban regions is smaller, and data collection is sparse and cannot satisfy the demands of the tasks. However, there are many users in urban regions, which makes data collection costly and of low quality. In this paper, a cooperative-based model for smartphone tasks, named a cooperative-based model for smart-sensing tasks (CMST), is proposed to promote the quality of data collection in FC networks. In the CMST scheme, we develop an allocation method focused on improving the rewards in suburban regions. The rewards to each user with a smart sensor are distributed according to the region density. Moreover, for each task there is a cooperative relationship among the users; they cooperate with one another to reach the volume of data that the platform requires. Extensive experiments show that our scheme improves the overall data-coverage factor by 14.997% to 31.46%, and the platform cost can be reduced by 35.882%.
