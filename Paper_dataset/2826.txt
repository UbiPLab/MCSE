AB In this paper, we consider fog radio access networks (F-RANs) consisting of cache-enabled device-to-device (D2D) transmitters and fog access points (F-APs), which deliver data by exploiting cached contents or leveraging cloud processing. We consider three types of modes at a typical user, namely, D2D, F-AP, and cooperative modes. In the D2D and the F-AP modes, when the user requests content, the user receives the content from a D2D transmitter and an F-AP caching the content, respectively. In the cooperative mode, F-APs located near the user send data aided by a centralized cloud processing unit. We also examine a mode selection algorithm in which the user adaptively selects one of the three modes. In practical scenarios, to mitigate interference, the transmitters may not be placed close to each other, and thus, there may exist a form of repulsion among the transmitters' locations. In this context, we model the spatial distributions of the D2D transmitters and the F-APs as beta-Ginibre point processes, which reflect the repulsive behavior and contain the Poisson point process as a special case. Then, we provide analytical expressions for the coverage probabilities in the F-RANs. Our results are corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations.
