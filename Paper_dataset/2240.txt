ID ACCELERATORS
AB Using FPGA as accelerators is gaining popularity in Cloud computing. Usually, FPGA accelerators in a datacenter are managed as a single resource pool. By issuing a request to this pool, a tenant can transparently access FPGA resources. FPGA requests usually arrive in batches. The objective of scheduling is to minimize the make-span of a given batch of requests, which is the completion time of the entire batch of jobs. As a result, either the responsiveness is improved, or the system throughput is maximized. The key technical challenge is the existence of multiple resource bottlenecks. An FPGA job can be bottlenecked by either computation (i.e., computation-intensive) or network (i.e., network-intensive), and sometimes by both. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that minimizes the make-span of batched requests for an FPGA accelerator pool in Cloud computing that considers multiple resource bottlenecks. In this paper, we design several scheduling algorithms to address the challenge. We implement our scheduling algorithms in an IBM Cloud system. We conduct extensive evaluations on both a small scale testbed and a large-scale simulator. Compared with the Shortest-Job-First scheduling, our algorithms can reduce the make-span by 36.25 percent, and improve the system throughput by 36.05 percent.
