AB Sensor-cloud is a developing technology and popular paradigm for various applications. It integrates wireless sensor into a cloud computing environment. On the one hand, the cloud offers extensive data storage and analytical and processing capabilities not available in sensor nodes. On the other hand, data distribution (such as time synchronization and configuration files) is always an important topic in such sensor-cloud systems, which leads to a rapid increase in energy consumption by sensors. In this paper, we aim to reduce the energy consumption of data dissemination in sensor-cloud systems and study the optimization of energy consumption with time-varying channel quality when multiple nodes use the same channel to transmit data. Suppose that there is a certain probability that the nodes send data for competing channel. And then, they decide to distribute data in terms of channel quality for saving energy after getting the channel successfully whether or not. Firstly, we construct the maximization problem of average energy efficiency for distributing data with delay demand. Then, this maximization problem transferred an optimal stopping problem which generates the optimal stopping rule. At last, the thresholds of the optimal transmission rate in each period are solved by using the optimal stopping theory, and the optimal energy efficiency for data distribution is achieved. Simulation results indicate that the strategy proposed in this paper can to some extent improve average energy efficiency and delivery ratio and enhance energy optimization effect and network performance compared with other strategies.
