AB Multimedia cloud computing has appeared as a very attractive environment for the business world in terms of providing cost-effective services with a minimum of entry costs and infrastructure requirements. There are some architecture proposals in the related literature, but there is no multimedia cloud computing architecture with hybrid features specifically designed for mobile devices. In this article, we propose a new multimedia hybrid cloud computing architecture and protocol. It merges existing private and public clouds and combines IaaS, SaaS and SECaaS cloud computing models in order to find a common platform to deliver real time traffic from heterogeneous multimedia and social networks for mobile users. The developed protocol provides suitable levels of QoS, while providing a secure and trusted cloud environment.
