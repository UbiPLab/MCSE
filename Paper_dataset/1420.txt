AB In order to improve the intelligence of higher mathematics teaching resource scheduling, a higher mathematics teaching resource scheduling system based on cloud computing is designed. A balanced modulation control algorithm for higher mathematics teaching resources is proposed on the overall design of this system and an association rule constraint model for higher mathematics teaching resource allocation is constructed based on the design results. The adaptive weighted control method is adopted for distributed control of higher mathematics teaching resources and a priority attribute list of higher teaching resource scheduling is established. The higher mathematics teaching resource allocation and adaptive information fusion are realized according to the priority list. On this basis, the higher mathematics teaching resource scheduling system based on cloud computing is designed optimally through the embedded control technology. The simulation results show that, in the allocation of teaching resources, the balance coefficient of higher mathematics teaching resource scheduling system based on cloud computing has increased by 12.54%, and the accuracy of sending and receiving teaching data provided by this system has improved by 13.6%, which indicates that this system has relatively good intelligence and strong human-computer interaction ability.
