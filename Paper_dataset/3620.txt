AB The advancement of next-generation network technologies provides a huge improvement in healthcare facilities. Technologies such as 5G, edge computing, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things realize smart healthcare that a client can have anytime, anywhere, arid in real time. Edge computing offers useful computing resources at the edge of the network to maintain low-latency and real-time computing. In this article, we propose a smart healthcare framework using edge computing. In the framework, we develop a voice disorder assessment and treatment system using a deep learning approach. A client provides his or her voice sample captured by smart sensors, and the sample goes to the edge computing for initial processing. Then the edge computing sends data to a core cloud for further processing. The assessment and management are controlled by a service provider through a cloud manager. Once the automatic assessment is done, the decision is sent to specialists, who prescribe appropriate treatment to the clients. The proposed system achieves 98.5 percent accuracy and 99.3 percent sensitivity using the Saarbrucken Voice Disorder database.
