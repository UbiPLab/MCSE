AB Cloud Computing is becoming an important tool for improving productivity, efficiency and cost reduction. Hence, the advantages and potential benefits of cloud computing are no longer possible to be ignored by organizations. However, organizations must evaluate factors that influence their decisions before deciding to adopt cloud computing technologies. Many studies have investigated cloud computing adoption in developed countries compared with few studies that have concentrated on examining the factors that influence cloud computing adoption in developing countries. It is not clear to see whether these factors that have been identified by these studies, can be applied in developing countries. The motive of this study is to contribute to the adoption of cloud computing, and to elevate the consciousness of cloud computing technology amongst authorities, researchers, administrators, business enterprise managers and service carriers, particularly within the Saudi Arabian context. This study explores factors that encourage the implementation of cloud or have the capacity to detract from adopting cloud computing in private and public organizations in Saudi Arabia. A qualitative approach through IT professional representatives' interviews was adopted in this study, which explored two categories, namely, a) the negative impact category which includes: security and privacy, government policy, lack of knowledge, and Loss of control; and b) the positive impact category which includes three factors: reduce expenses, improve IT performance, and promote scalability and flexibility.
