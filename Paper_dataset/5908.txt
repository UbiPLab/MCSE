AB In previous works, we've proposed and described the functional aspects of a mobile agent system to help improve the early detection of the first signs of DoS/DDoS flooding attacks in Cloud environment. This system consists of some distributed components working altogether to help improve the safety of virtualized Cloud Computing environments. In this paper, we detail the algorithms of its main components; an analyzer module, an alert module, a security events module and a moving module. The proof of concept was simplified as possible as it can be to ensure the effectiveness of our concept. We have used the libpcap C library to gather Ethernet frames and process Ethernet, IP and ICMP headers. The simulations concern the behavior of our system when the virtual environment is suffering an ICMP flooding attack. The results show how well our system can be aware of the variation of the ICMP packets cadence.
