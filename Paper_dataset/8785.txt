AB This paper presents the results of research investigating the impact of business model factors on cloud computing adoption. The introduced research model consists of 40 cloud computing business model factors, grouped into eight factor groups. Their impact and importance for cloud computing adoption were investigated among enterpirses in Slovenia. Furthermore, differences in opinion according to enterprise size were investigated. Research results show no statistically significant impacts of investigated business model factor groups to cloud computing adoption. Nevertheless, based on slope coefficient directions and statistics values, some factor groups can be recognized as having moderate or strong, positive impact on cloud computing adoption; although their impact cannot be statistically confirmed with 95 % or 90 % levels of confidence. Furthermore, significant differences in opinion about the importance of business model factor groups and factors to cloud computing adoption according to enterprises size have been identified. The results represent a contribution to the theory of cloud computing adoption from the perspective of the provider's business model. In addition, findings provide orientation for innovation of existing business models towards the creation of a customer-oriented business model for more successful exploitation of cloud computing services and new business opportunities.
