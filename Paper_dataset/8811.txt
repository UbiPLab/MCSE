AB This paper investigates the interplay of cloud computing, fog computing, and Internet of Things (IoT) in control applications targeting the automation industry. In this context, a prototype is developed to explore the use of IoT devices that communicate with a cloud-based controller, i.e., the controller is offloaded to cloud or fog. Several experiments are performed to investigate the consequences of having a cloud server between the end device and the controller. The experiments are performed while considering arbitrary jitter and delays, i.e., they can be smaller than, equal to, or greater than the sampling period. This paper also applies mitigation mechanisms to deal with the delays and jitter that are caused by the networks when the controller is offloaded to the fog or cloud.
