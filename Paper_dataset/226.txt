AB Timely and accurate regional rice paddy monitoring plays a significant role in maintaining the sustainable rice production, food security, and agricultural development. This study proposes an operational automatic approach to mapping rice paddies using time-series SAR data. The proposed method integrates time-series Sentinel-1 data, auxiliary data of global surface water, and rice phenological characteristics with Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform. A total of 402 Sentinel-1 scenes from 2017 were used for mapping rice paddies extent in the Mun River basin. First, the calculated minimum and maximum values of the backscattering coefficient of permanent water (a classification type within global surface water data) in a year was used as the threshold range for extracting the potential extent. Then, three rice phenological characteristics were extracted based on the time-series curve of each pixel, namely the date of the beginning of the season (DBS), date of maximum backscatter during the peak growing season (DMP), and length of the vegetative stage (LVS). After setting a threshold for each phenological parameter, the final rice paddy extent was identified. Rice paddy map produced in this study was highly accurate and agreed well with field plot data and rice map products from the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). The results had a total accuracy of 89.52% and an F1 score of 0.91, showing that the spatiotemporal pattern of extracted rice cover was consistent with ground truth samples in the Mun River basin. This approach could be expanded to other rice-growing regions at the national scale, or even the entire Indochina Peninsula and Southeast Asia.
