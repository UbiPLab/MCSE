AB Cloud computing provides scalable network services and makes network management more flexible by combining Software-Defined Networking (SDN). Through the northbound interface (e.g., REST API) offered by the SDN controller, users can easily deploy diversified applications to access the network resources. However, exploiting the openness of the northbound interface, malicious applications abuse APIs to launch hostile attacks, which poses serious threats to the network. In this paper, we propose SEAPP, a secure application management framework based on REST API access control. Our main idea is to granularly manage application permissions and encrypt REST API calls to defend against malicious attacks. SEAPP includes two components: 1) permissions detection engine identifies the facticity of application permissions by analyzing permission manifests and byte codes and further identifies the legality of permissions with constructed sensitive API list; 2) registration authorization engine executes encrypted registration between applications and controller by virtue of NTRU algorithm and authorizes applications to call the requested REST APIs based on their risk levels after securely authenticating them. Besides, SEAPP is a lightweight logic architecture between application plane and control plane and supports quick deployment and reconfiguration in runtime. Both theoretical analysis and evaluation results show the security and effectiveness of SEAPP. Besides, SEAPP introduces negligible CPU and memory overheads. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.
