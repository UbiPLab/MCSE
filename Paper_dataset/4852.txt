AB Cloud computing can be considered as one of the leading-edge technological advances in the current IT industry. Cloud computing or simply cloud is attributed to the Service Oriented Architecture. Every organization is trying to utilize the benefit of cloud not only to reduce the cost overhead in infrastructure, network, hardware, software, etc., but also to provide seamless service to end users with the benefit of scalability. The concept of multitenancy assists cloud service providers to leverage the costs by providing services tomultiple users/companies at the same time via shared resource. There are several cloud service providers currently in the market and they are rapidly changing and reorienting themselves as per market demand. In order to gain market share, the cloud service providers are trying to provide the latest technology to end users/customers with the reduction of costs. In such scenario, it becomes extremely difficult for cloud customers to select the best service provider as per their requirement. It is also becoming difficult to decide upon the deployment model to choose among the existing ones. The deployment models are suitable for different companies. There exist divergent criteria for different deploymentmodels which are not tailormade for an organization. As a cloud customer, it is difficult to decide on the model and determine the appropriate service provider. The multicriteria decision making method is applied to find out the best suitable service provider among the top existing four companies and choose the deployment model as per requirement.
