AB A cloud computing environment is an excellent alternative for deploying a teaching and learning system in an educational institution that lacks sufficient funds. Such an option aims to offer effective learning and teaching services to both students and teachers without spending much on computers and network devices. Cloud computing is a recent technology that is likely to have a tremendous impact on teaching and learning. The cloud provides access to a rich database of learning tools and materials, which are accessible anywhere and anytime. Based on such information, the paper investigates the application of a resource-sharing platform under a cloud computing environment. Experiment results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed resource-sharing platform based on cloud computing technology.
