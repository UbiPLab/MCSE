ID BIG DATA-STORAGE
AB Cloud computing encourages users to outsource their data to cloud storage. Data outsourcing means that users lose physical autonomy on their own data, which makes remote data integrity verification become a critical challenge for potential cloud users. To free user from the burden incurred by frequent integrity verifications, Third Party Auditor (TPA) is introduced to perform verifications on behalf of user for data integrity assurance. However, existing public auditing schemes rely on the assumption that TPA is trusted, thus these schemes cannot be directly extended to support the outsourced auditing model, where TPA might be dishonest and any two of the three involved entities (i.e. user, TPA, and cloud service provider) might be in collusion. In this paper, we propose a dynamic outsourced auditing scheme which cannot only protect against any dishonest entity and collision, but also support verifiable dynamic updates to outsourced data. We present a new approach, based on batch-leaves-authenticated Merkle Hash Tree (MHT), to batch-verify multiple leaf nodes and their own indexes all together, which is more appropriate for the dynamic outsourced auditing system than traditional MHT-based dynamism approaches that can only verify many leaf nodes one by one. Experimental results show that our solution minimizes the costs of initialization for both user and TPA (compared to existing static outsourced auditing scheme), and incurs a lower price of dynamism at user side.
