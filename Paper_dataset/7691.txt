AB The Quadruple Silo (QS) problem refers to four silos that result from deploying commercial solutions for smart cities: physical, data, and service management silos, and their implications in administrative silos. As this analysis of a Barcelona fog computing initiative shows, a converged cloud/fog paradigm not only helps solve the QS problem, it also meets the requirements of a growing number of decentralized services where traditional cloud models fall short. In addition to exposing cases where fog computing is a must, this article shows that reasons for deploying fog are centered much more on operational requirements than on cloud-related performance issues.
