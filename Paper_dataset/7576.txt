AB The integration of cloud computing with mobile computing and internet has given birth to mobile cloud computing. This technology offers many advantages to users, like Storage capacity, Reliability, Scalability and Real time data availability. Therefore, it is s increasing fast and it is inevitably integrated into everyday life. In MCC, data processing and data storage can be migrated into the cloud servers. However, the confidentiality of images and data is most important in today's environment. In this paper, we mainly focus on secure outsourcing of images. For this purpose, we propose a secure architecture composed by two clouds a private cloud dedicated for encryption/decryption and a second public cloud dedicated for storage. We have implemented the first cloud using openstack while respecting the encryption as a service concept. As an encryption scheme, we have used paillier's homomorphic cryptosystem designed specifically for images. The test of the homomorphic property is done by applying the Watermarking algorithm DWT.
