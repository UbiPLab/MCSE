DE Cloud computing; remote user authentication; smart card
AB Cloud computing is an emerging computing paradigm in which resources of the computing infrastructure are provided as outsourcing services through the Internet. With cloud computing technique, the users are able to outsource their computing and storage tasks to the cloud servers. In cloud computing environments, the user authentication is very important issue because it provides the authorization while users access their data and cloud services. In 2014, Chen et al. improved Choudhury et al.'s scheme, and claimed that their scheme is more secure and practical remote user authentication scheme for cloud computing. However, we find that Chen et al.'s scheme is still insecure against outsider attack, server impersonation attack, smart card stolen attack and off-line password guessing attack. To overcome this drawback, we propose a robust and more secure user authentication scheme. Finally, we show that our proposed scheme is more secure and supports security properties than Chen et al.'s scheme.
