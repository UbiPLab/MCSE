AB Software as a service (SaaS) is a software that is developed and hosted by the SaaS vendor. SaaS cloud provides software as services to the users through the internet. To provide good quality of service for the user, the SaaS relies on the resources leased from infrastructure as a service cloud providers. As the SaaS services rapidly expand their application scopes, it is important to optimize resource allocation in SaaS cloud. The paper presents optimization-based resource allocation approach for software as a service application in cloud. The paper uses optimization decomposition approach to solve cloud resource allocation for satisfying the cloud user's needs and the profits of the cloud providers. The paper also proposes a SaaS cloud resource allocation algorithm. The experiments are designed to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with other two related algorithms.
