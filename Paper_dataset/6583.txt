AB For increasing usage of mobile cloud computing, computation offloading helps cleverly utilize the environmental resource. In this work, the computation offloading decision to remote cloud is made in a distributed manner, which falls within the framework of evolutionary game theory. This framework has the advantage of less strict requirement, e.g., without decision makers' idealized rationality. To find the optimal trade-off point among power consumption and communication latency, a joint optimization problem is formulated. Besides, targeted at solving this problem, a distributed algorithm, which is easy to implement, is proposed. Numerical studies show our proposed scheme indeed functions well in the meaning that the players will eventually turn to equilibrium.
