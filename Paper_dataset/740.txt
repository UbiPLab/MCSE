AB With the rise of cryptocurrencies, blockchain, which is the underlying technology of them, has gained more attention and been used in the Internet of Things (IoT) and other fields. However, there are bottlenecks that hinder its application, such as the storage capacity. Due to the large number of IoT devices which always act as data generators in many systems, the transactions will be generated at a high rate. The storage problem will be more serious in IoT. In this article, to expand the capacity of blockchain, for each peer, we select old blocks which are created previously and less likely to be queried and store them in the cloud. Based on this idea, we develop objective functions related to query probability, storage cost, and local space occupancy, which naturally narrows down the problem to block selection. The results can be obtained by solving a multiobjective optimization problem. We design a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm with clustering (NSGA-C), which changes the method of selecting individuals from the critical dominance layer by adding clustering to ensure diversity. A suitable solution can be selected from the Pareto set to fulfil the requirements of different users. We then compare the algorithm with the improved NSGA-II and NSGA-III, which both add integer constraints to the decision variables. The results show that our method is better than NSGA-II and NSGA-III in terms of local space occupancy in the blockchain application. In addition, it can also effectively avoid the risk of block overflow.
