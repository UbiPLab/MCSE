AB Using Internet of Things (IoTs) and cloud computing technologies in the era of big data to design a highly shared marine logistics information platform is the basis for realizing the information, efficiency, and intelligence of its logistics process. This research integrated big data thinking and sharing concepts into shared logistics, designed the architecture of a highly shared marine logistics information platform, and proposed an implementation method and application model for the architecture. The platform design introduces artificial intelligence and IoT technologies based on GPS, general packet radio service, and automatic identification system. The platform realizes real-time positioning and monitoring of land and sea cargo, which greatly improves the efficiency of marine logistics management.
