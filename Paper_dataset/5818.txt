AB To allow mobile robots to visually observe the temperature of equipment in complex industrial environments and work on temperature anomalies in time, it is necessary to accurately find the coordinates of temperature anomalies and obtain information on the surrounding obstacles. This paper proposes a visual saliency detection method for hypertemperature in three-dimensional space through dual-source images. The key novelty of this method is that it can achieve accurate salient object detection without relying on high-performance hardware equipment. First, the redundant point clouds are removed through adaptive sampling to reduce the computational memory. Second, the original images are merged with infrared images and the dense point clouds are surface-mapped to visually display the temperature of the reconstructed surface and use infrared imaging characteristics to detect the plane coordinates of temperature anomalies. Finally, transformation mapping is coordinated according to the pose relationship to obtain the spatial position. Experimental results show that this method not only displays the temperature of the device directly but also accurately obtains the spatial coordinates of the heat source without relying on a high-performance computing platform.
