AB Under the co-promotion of the wave of urbanization and the rise of data science, smart cities have become the new concept and new practice of urban development. Smart cities are the combination of information technology represented by the Internet of Things, cloud computing, mobile networks and big data, and urbanization. How to effectively achieve the long-term preservation of massive, heterogeneous, and multi-source digital electronic records in smart cities is a key issue thatmust be solved. Digital continuity can ensure the accessibility, integrity and availability of information. The quality management of electronic record, like the quality management of product, will run through every phase of the urban lifecycle. Based on data quality management, this paper constructs digital continuity of smart city electronic records. Furthermore, thework in this paper ensures the authenticity, integrity, availability and timeliness of electronic documents by quality management of electronic record. This paper elaborates on the overall technical architecture of electronic record, as well as the various technical means needed to protect its four characteristics.
