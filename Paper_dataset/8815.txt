AB In this study, we reveal and analyse the hitherto implicit intellectual structure of cloud computing by using the methods of patent clustering and co-word clustering, respectively. In order to enhance the quality of patent clustering, we conduct the Taguchi method, which uses the E-I index as the quality characteristic, to investigate three influential factors to the quality, including the cut-off value for dichotomisation, the number of terms, and the sparsity. In co-word clustering analysis, this study demonstrates how the utilisation of the proposed modified co-word analysis method, factor analysis, multidimensional scaling analysis, and network analysis can efficiently explore the relation between R&D themes and competition between companies. This study reveals the knowledge networks in the area of Software as a Service (SaaS), thereby helping academia and practitioners to reach a richer understanding of the up-to-date studies.
