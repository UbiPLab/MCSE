AB As various factors which affect the development of global market economy become increasingly uncertain, economy and commodity will become more and more fluctuating in economic operation. With its strong nonlinear mapping capacity, artificial neural network has already been applied in many fields, time series analysis, and trend prediction. Cloud computing can interact fast with service provider at the minimum management cost. This paper proposes an economic forecast and optimized resource allocation model based on cloud computing and BP neural network. Its main goal is to break down a complex prediction task into several sub-tasks, effectively reduce the workload of a single computer and enhance the operating efficiency. Simulation results show that the proposed method does not rely on gradient information and has strong optimization calculation ability. At the same time, it can analyze and predict economic management, so as to provide strong decision support for decision makers.
