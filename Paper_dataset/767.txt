AB Network Function Virtualization (NFV) enables Network Operators (NOs) to efficiently respond to the increasing dynamicity of network services. Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) running on commercial off-the-shelf servers are easy to deploy, update, monitor, and manage. Such virtualized services are often deployed as Service Chains (SCs), which require in-sequence placement of computing and memory resources as well as routing of traffic flows. Due to the ongoing migration towards cloudification of networks, the concept of auto-scaling which originated in Cloud Computing, is now receiving attention from networks professionals too. Prior studies on auto-scaling use measured load to dynamically react to traffic changes. Moreover, they often focus on only one of the resources (e.g., compute only, or network capacity only). In this study, we consider three different resource types: compute, memory, and network bandwidth. In prior studies, NO takes auto-scaling decisions, assuming tenants are always willing to auto-scale, and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements are homogeneous. Our study proposes a negotiation-game-based auto-scaling method where tenants and NO both engage in the auto-scaling decision, based on their willingness to participate, heterogeneous QoS requirements, and financial gain (e.g., cost savings). In addition, we propose a proactive Machine Learning (ML) based prediction method to perform SC auto-scaling in dynamic traffic scenario. Numerical examples show that our proposed SC auto-scaling methods powered by ML present a win-win situation for both NO and tenants (in terms of cost savings).
