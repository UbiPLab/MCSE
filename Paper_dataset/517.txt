AB With the increasing demand for cloud computing, its challenges are also increasing, and security is one of the preeminent concerns. A number of approaches were introduced earlier to secure cloud storage systems, but many of them failed to provide security effectively and even emanate the concern of cost. Efficiency and cost are the essential features for any cloud system and demand for a security mechanism. To accomplish this objective, a novel feature is introduced with a concept of biometric authentication and named as 'biometric-based un-locker'. Biometrics entities are unique in nature, so it will be the best and most cost-effective solution for the cloud. The performance of this proposed system is analyzed by generating a cloud environment and implementing it using the .NET framework on five different datasets. The results are calculated with both attackers and normal users, and performance is analyzed on the basis of time, size of data after encryption, and authentication rate. Results show that the proposed system effectively provides security and is also very cost-efficient.
