AB Providing security to the data that stored in personal health record (PHR) is an emerging and critical task in recent years. For this purpose, some of the encryption and key generation techniques are developed in the traditional works. But it has the drawbacks such as lacks in access control policies, reduced security, and ineffective. So this work implemented the efficient techniques, namely, elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman for the secret key generation and identity attribute-based encryption for improving the security of the cloud data. Initially, the cloud user can request the patient's data to the PHR admin, and then they can generate the secret by using the elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman algorithm. The key that used for encryption and decryption is generated by using the identity attribute-based encryption technique. Then, the access control is provided to the users based on their roles. The requested data are encrypted by applying the advanced encryption standard technique. After that, the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm is used to generate the digital signature for the encrypted data. Furthermore, it is verified with the user's digital signature; if it matches, the data can be accessed by the user with the help of advanced encryption standard decryption mechanism. Finally, the authenticated user can able to access the patient's data from PHR. In experiments, the performance of the proposed encryption and key generation technique is evaluated and compared with the existing techniques for proving the effectiveness of the implemented system.
