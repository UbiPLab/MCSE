AB The Internet is evolving rapidly toward the future Internet of Things (IoT) which will potentially connect billions or even trillions of edge devices which could generate huge amount of data at a very high speed and some of the applications may require very low latency. The traditional cloud infrastructure will run into a series of difficulties due to centralized computation, storage, and networking in a small number of datacenters, and due to the relative long distance between the edge devices and the remote datacenters. To tackle this challenge, edge cloud and edge computing seem to be a promising possibility which provides resources closer to the resource-poor edge IoT devices and potentially can nurture a new IoT innovation ecosystem. Such prospect is enabled by a series of emerging technologies, including network function virtualization and software defined networking. In this survey paper, we investigate the key rationale, the state-of-the-art efforts, the key enabling technologies and research topics, and typical IoT applications benefiting from edge cloud. We aim to draw an overall picture of both ongoing research efforts and future possible research directions through comprehensive discussions.
