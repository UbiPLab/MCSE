AB The use of cloud computing has become common due to advantages such as low cost and sizing of computing resources according to demand. However, it also raises security and privacy concerns, because critical data - for example, in IoT applications - are stored and processed in the cloud. This paper proposes a software architecture that supports multiple approaches to secure data aggregation. For validation purposes, this software architecture was used in the development of applications for smart grids, computing instantaneous consumption of a region and the monthly bill of an individual consumer. The consumption data can be collected by smart meters, enabling consumers to reduce electricity costs through close monitoring. However, such data may reveal sensitive information if no privacy techniques are applied. Therefore, the proposed software architecture proved to be viable from experiments with techniques such as homomorphic encryption and hardware security extensions (Intel SGX).
