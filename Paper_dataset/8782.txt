AB With the development of information technology and network, the face of today's large amount of data, data mining needs to be carried out in order to get useful information. The analysis and processing of these huge data requires computing powerful cloud computing. Based on the cloud computing technology, the vehicle trajectory was researched by data mining. Based on the basic principles of cloud computing and data mining, a vehicle trajectory data mining system based on cloud computing was constructed. The clustering algorithm was used to cluster the vehicle trajectory. Finally, the system was implemented and tested. The realization results show that the system can obtain the trajectory information of the vehicle effectively, which makes a certain contribution to the management of vehicles and the supervision of traffic.
