AB In the era of big data, scientific research is entering a key stage of scientific development under the guidance of a new paradigm, "e-Science", and the core characteristics of which are collaboration and sharing. In the past decade, e-Science has rapidly developed around the world. There are now e-Science strategic plans, projects and extensive research activities on the national and international scales that encompass particle physics, astronomy, earth science, ecology, marine science, medicine, life sciences and other disciplines. However, there is no uniform and clear understanding of the essence, characteristics, infrastructure and application of e-Geoscience. This paper first discusses and analyzes the development of e-Science in a global context and then explores its development in China. Next, the development of e-Geoscience is discussed, particularly regarding the details of its design and implementation in China, including a conceptual model, a mode of application, a logical hierarchy, and functional and technical systems. Finally, the paper introduces a typical application, called the Northeast Asia Joint Scientific Exploration and Cooperative Research Platform (NAJSECRP), which is operating in research institutions in China, Russia and Mongolia. This platform can not only provide geodata and bibliographies and promote resource sharing but also provides a collaborative research platform for scientific exploration. In practice, this platform has been shown to save costs and improve the efficiency of transnational, interdisciplinary scientific exploration and cooperative research.
