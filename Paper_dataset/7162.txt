AB Computing environment has changed a lot by development of network and wide spread of the mobile terminal. Among them, adoption of cloud computing causes a large change socially. The social consensus by introduction of smartwork based on this cloud computing environment is increasing. Especially, smartwork which can work freely anytime and anywhere has been noted as a new business model while broadband communication infrastructure becomes popular. However, smartwork based on cloud computing environment has a variety of security vulnerabilities. The risk of information leakage is increasing according to increasing of vulnerability of virtualization technology which cloud computing has, and security threats of mobile terminal used to smartwork. In this paper, we look security element by smartwork design for the activation of the smartwork based on cloud computing and organize to respond to the attack. The corresponding method presented in this paper will be applied to safe security model.
