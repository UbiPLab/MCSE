AB "The request protecting encryption" (OPE) is a proficient apparatus to scramble importance scores of the rearranged list. At the point when utilizing determined process, ciphertext may uncover dispersion in pertinent score. A probable One to Many Encrypt, for searching all the available encryption process that will level appropriation that is present in the plaintexts. For proposing a different attack on One to Many OPE by abusing distinctions for the requested ciphertext. The testing results are exhibited in a way where the cloud server gets a decent gauge of the dispersion of significance scored by differential assault process. While having multiple foundation data on the outsource record, the cloud servers precisely construe the encoded catchphrases by utilizing the evaluated circulations. Encryption on delicate information presents impediments to the handling of the information. Data recovery gets to be troublesome in the scrambled space in light of the fact that the measure of outsourced records can be huge and conventional hunt. The suspicion that OPES is a deterministic process of the encryption plan which implies that given plaintext present will dependably be encoded as settled ciphertexts. Notwithstanding, deterministic encryption releases the circulation present in the plaintexts, where it cannot guarantee information security in many applications. So we proposed a One to Many Order Preservation Encryption on their secured catchwords that seek planning, where they will be attempted to develop probabilistic encryption plot and covers the dispersion in plaintexts.
