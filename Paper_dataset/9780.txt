AB The setup environment and deployment of distributed applications is a human intensive and highly complex process that poses significant challenges. Nowadays many applications are developed in the cloud and existing applications are migrated to the cloud because of the promising advantages of cloud computing. Presenting two common serious challenging scenarios in the application development environment, we propose a multi-task PaaS cloud infrastructure using Docker and AWS services for application isolation, optimization and rapid deployment of distributed applications. We fully utilized Docker, a lightweight containerization technology that uses a host of the Linux kernel's features such as namespaces and cgroup's to sandbox processes into configurable virtual environments. The Amazon EC2 container service helps our container management framework. The cluster management framework uses optimistic, shared state scheduling to execute processes on EC2 instances using Docker containers. Several experimentations were carried out, one of the experimentation focused on a simulation of application deployment scheduling that shows our propose infrastructure is flexible, efficient and well optimized.
