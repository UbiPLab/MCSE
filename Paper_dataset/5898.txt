AB The IoT-Cloud fusion virtual machine is a virtual machine for IoT appliances that employs offloading techniques that delegate tasks requiring high computing power to low-performance appliances to a high-performance cloud server environment. IoT devices embedded with IoT-Cloud fusion virtual machines can perform complex tasks using the computing power of high-performance servers. The virtual machine with the existing offloading mechanism sends and receives all the context information to maintain program consistency in the communication between the local environment and the cloud server environment. Most of the overhead costs incurred in offloading are proportional to the size of the context information transmitted over the network. Therefore, the existing context information synchronization structure sends context information that is not necessary for the task to be performed when offloading, thereby increasing the overhead cost incurred in the process of transmitting the context information in low-performance IoT devices.
   In this paper, in order to solve this problem, we classify the cases according to the context information required for the offloading function to send and receive only the context information necessary for the task execution without sending or receiving all the context information when offloading. Also, we have studied contextual information synchronization technique to send and receive minimum context information by synchronizing context information according to classified cases. The IoT-Cloud fusion virtual machine with improved contextual information synchronization scheme reduces the size of context information to be transmitted, thereby reducing the overhead cost of communication in low-performance IoT devices, thereby improving the offloading efficiency.
