AB Water is a vital resource without which most of the living beings cannot survive. The quality of drinking water depends on its source and storage conditions. Drinking water quality should meet the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations for quality assurance. Various purification methods are available to obtain pure drinking water. However, several industrialisation, globalisation, urbanisation, farming, and similar activities lead to drinking water contamination. Thus, the combined use of green engineering principles and internet of things (IoT) framework can aid simultaneous monitoring of water quality at different locations, at minimal costs and less need for manpower. This study proposes a system for real-time monitoring of water quality and detection of contamination, by using a wireless sensor network (WSN) to collect and transmit data. This system measures turbidity, pH, and temperature; these values are then processed using a controller and transmitted to the cloud through the WSN. The gathered data are highly accurate and can be accessed universally through the Internet by using a specific internet protocol address.
