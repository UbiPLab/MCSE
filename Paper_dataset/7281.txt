AB According to the characteristics of task scheduling in cloud computing, a niche particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to solve cloud task scheduling problem. Based on the standard particle swarm algorithm, this paper introduces the niche technology, introduces the parallel thread, accelerates the optimization speed, and can balance the global and local search ability. The velocity and the updating equation of the particle are added with the shrinkage factor. Finally, a method for solving cloud task scheduling is given. Through the simulation of cloud task scheduling system, the experimental results show that this algorithm not only overcomes the shortcomings of PSO algorithm in local optimization, but also improves the convergence precision. It has a good effect in shortening the execution time, cost and load balance, and is an effective cloud task scheduling algorithm.
