AB With the large-scale deployment of cloud datacenters, high energy consumption and serious service level agreement (SLA) violations in datacenters have become an increasingly urgent problem to be addressed. Implementing an effective virtual machine (VM) consolidation methods is of great significance to reduce energy consumption and SLA violations. The VM consolidation problem is a well-known NP-hard problem. Meanwhile, efficient VM consolidation should consider multiple factors synthetically, including quality of service, energy consumption, and migration overhead, which is a multi-objective optimization problem. To solve the problem above, we propose a new multi-objective VM consolidation approach based on double thresholds and ant colony system (ACS). The proposed approach leverages double thresholds of CPU utilization to identify the host load status, VM consolidation is triggered when the host is overloaded or underloaded. During consolidation, the approach selects migration VMs and destination hosts simultaneously based on ACS, utilizing diverse selection policies according to the host load status. The extensive experiment is conducted to compare our proposed approach with the state-of-art VM consolidation approaches. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach remarkably reduces energy consumption and optimizes SLA violation rates thus achieving better comprehensive performance.
