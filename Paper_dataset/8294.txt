AB Existing simulators are designed to simulate a few thousand nodes due to the tight integration of modules. Thus, with limited simulator scalability, researchers/developers are unable to simulate protocols and algorithms in detail, although cloud simulators provide geographically distributed data centers environment but lack the support for execution on distributed systems. In this paper, we propose a distributed simulation framework referred to as CloudSimScale. The framework is designed on top of highly adapted CloudSim with communication among different modules managed using IEEE Std 1516 (high-level architecture). The underlying modules can now run on the same or different physical systems and still manage to discover and communicate with one another. Thus, the proposed framework provides scalability across distributed systems and interoperability across modules and simulators.
