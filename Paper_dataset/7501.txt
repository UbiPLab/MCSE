AB Distributed energy resources (ERs), featured with small-scale power generation technologies and renewable energy sources, are considered as necessary supplements for smart grid. To ensure that merged resources contribute effectively to the grid, data generated by consumer side should be shared among the ERs. However, it also introduces challenges of the protection of consumer privacy. To address these difficulties, we propose a new framework to share data in smart grid by leveraging new advances in homomorphic encryption and proxy re-encryption. Our proposed framework allows ERs to analyze consumer data while ensuring consumer privacy. An additional benefit of our proposed framework is that consumer data is transmitted over the smart grid only once. Furthermore, we present a concrete scheme falling into the proposed framework. Extensive analysis shows that the concrete scheme is secure and efficient.
