AB In order to explore the information management, the cloud computing technology is applied to the field of geographic information system, and remote sensing data storage and management system based on Hadoop is studied and realized. The main function of this system includes that the remote sensing data storage module provides the remote sensing data download function for data administrator, supports HTTP protocol and FTP protocol multi-threaded distributed HTTP download. The parallel constructing algorithm of remote sensing image of Pyramid based on Map Reduce is realized by the module, and layered cutting and block storage of massive remote sensing data are carried out. The GDAL open source library suitable for fast read raster data is used and it provides data resource for remote sensing data parallel cutting. In addition, the Geo Web Cache open source tile map service middle ware is adopted and HBase is introduced as the storage support of tiles, which can deal with a large number of users' visit, including loading and drag of maps. The system test is carried out to verify the effectiveness and practicability of the method proposed. The test results can show that the remote sensing data storage and management system based on Hadoop can effectively handle remote sensing data and improve the user's experience. It is concluded that the information management system has high effectiveness and good practicability.
