AB Accompanied by the rapid development of mobile video service requirements, the dramatic increase in video streaming traffic causes a heavy burden for mobile networks. Mobile edge computing (MEC) has become a promising paradigm to enhance the mobile networks by providing cloud-computing capabilities within the radio access network (RAN). With the ability of content caching and context awareness, MEC could provide low-latency and adaptive-bitrate video streaming to improve service providing ability of the RAN. In this paper, we propose an MEC enhanced adaptive bitrate (ABR) video delivery scheme, which combines content caching and ABR streaming technology together. The MEC server acts as a controlling component to implement the video caching strategy and adjust the transmitted bitrate version of videos flexibly. A Stackelberg game is formulated to deal with the storage resources occupied by each base station. The joint cache and radio resource allocation (JCRA) is tackled into a matching problem. We propose the JCRA algorithm to solve the matching problem in order to make the cooperation between cache and radio resources. Simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme could improve both the cache hit ratio and the system throughput over other schemes.
