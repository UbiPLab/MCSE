AB Many kinds of OGC-based web standards have been utilized in the lots of geo-spatial application fields for sharing and interoperable processing of large volume of data sets containing satellite images. As well, the number of cloud-based application services by on-demand processing of virtual machines is increasing. However, remote sensing applications using these two huge trends are globally on the initial stage. This study presents a practical linkage case with both aspects of OGC-based standard and cloud computing. Performance test is performed with the implementation result for cloud detection processing. Test objects are WPS 2.0 and two types of geo-based service environment such as web server in a single core and multiple virtual servers implemented on OpenStack cloud computing environment. Performance test unit by JMeter is five requests of GetCapabilities, DescribeProcess, Execute, GetStatus, GetResult in WPS 2.0. As the results, the performance measurement time in a cloud-based environment is faster than that of single server. It is expected that expansion of processing algorithms by WPS 2.0 and virtual processing is possible to target-oriented applications in the practical level.
