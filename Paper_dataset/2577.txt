AB The terminals in mobile cloud computing have themselves the special characteristics, such as mobile flexibility, distributed in different domains, resource constraint and easily to be captured et al. The terminals in mobile cloud computing participated the collaborative computing, information exchange and sharing secrets may come from different domains, different networks or different clouds. For this complex network environment the paper proposes a Multi-domain lightweight Asymmetric group key agreement (ML-AGKA). It adopts the bilinear mapping and blind key technology to achieve an asymmetric group key agreement protocol among mobile terminals distributed in different domains, proposes a computation and communication migration technologies to ensure that the mobile terminals are lightweight computing and communication consumption. The protocol can also achieve anonymity and authentication. The protocol is proven secure under the Computational Diffe-Hellman (CDH) problem assumption and the performance analysis shows that the proposed protocol is highly efficient.
