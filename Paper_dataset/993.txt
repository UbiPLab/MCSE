AB People have become busier in the modern world with both work and housework. In addition to the different types of robotic cleaner, it would be quite helpful to have a smart robotic trash collection and dumping system that provides on-call services so that a user does not need to physically get up and put trash into a trash can. As the bin reaches its maximum capacity, it also dumps the trash automatically without the user's instructions. Available smart trash cans are usually focused on determining if the trash is recyclable. Most trash cans also do not have the capability to move autonomously. In this research, we utilize fingerprint mapping for wireless indoor positioning towards the implementation of an autonomous vehicle with a mounted trash can. The user may make an indoor call to the trash-can-mounted vehicle via a mobile application under an IoT and cloud computing environment. The vehicle can position itself in front of the user for trash collection through automatic obstacle avoidance navigation with smart path planning from deep learning. The system can also monitor the amount of accumulated trash and dump trash at a fixed location before returning to the start point. This research on a smart trash-collecting robot can provide significant assistance to people who are busy, those with impaired or limited movements, and the elderly.
