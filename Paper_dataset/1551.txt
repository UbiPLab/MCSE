AB In the past, the apprenticeship system was used to inherit folk art. However, the traditional and rigid teaching methods in the classroom led to the poor effect of learning ethnic and folk art and even the loss of many folk arts. Nowadays, related technologies such as the Internet, cloud computing, and big data are constantly being updated. Under this background of rapid technological development, it is of strong practical significance to integrate ethnic and folk art with technical means. Based on the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework, the ethnic and folk art space course was constructed in this study by combining the "technology + teaching method + subject knowledge" integration model. Scientific technology was integrated with the education of ethnic and folk art to propose the solution idea and system architecture. Meanwhile, the TPACK-based ethnic and folk art space course was put into practical application to verify its learning effect. The final results show that compared with the traditional teaching, the TPACK-based ethnic and folk art space course can improve the teaching efficiency and promote students' mastery of various skills of ethnic and folk art.
