AB Cloud computing is an emerging technology paradigm that migrates current computing and technological concepts into utility-like solutions similar to electricity and water systems. Clouds bring out a wide range of advantages including configurable computing resources, economic savings, and service flexibility. Cloud service providers use data centers to house cloud services and cloud-based resources. For cloud-hosting purposes, vendors also often own multiple data centers in several geographic locations to safeguard data availability during outages and other data center failures. Security in Cloud computing is an important and critical aspect, and has numerous issues and problem related to it. Cloud computing is a framework for providing computing service via the internet on demand and pay per use access to a pool of shared resources namely networks, storage, servers, services and applications, without physically acquiring them. So it saves managing cost and time for organizations. However, privacy and security concerns are shown to be the primary obstacles to a wide adoption of clouds. The new concepts that clouds introduce, such as multi-tenancy, resource outsourcing and sharing, create new challenges to the security community. Addressing these challenges requires, in addition to the ability to cultivate and tune the security measures developed for traditional computing systems, proposing new security policies, models, and protocols to address the unique cloud security challenges.
