AB The main objective of the proposed methodology is multi-objective job scheduling using hybridization of whale and BAT optimization algorithm (WBAT) which is used to change existing solution and to adopt a new good solution based on the objective function. The scheduling function in the proposed job scheduling strategy first creates a set of jobs and cloud node to generate the population by assigning jobs to cloud node randomly and evaluate the fitness function which minimizes the makespan and maximizes the quality of jobs. Second, the function uses iterations to regenerate populations based on WBAT behavior to produce the best job schedule that gives minimum makespan and good quality of jobs. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed methods is better than the other methods of job scheduling problems.
