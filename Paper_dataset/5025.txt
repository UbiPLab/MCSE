AB With the wide deployment of cloud computing, many security challenges have arisen, such as data and storage integrity and virtualization security. The crisis of trust caused by these security issues has become one of the important factors restricting the wide applications of cloud service. Especially for security-sensitive users, it is challenging to quickly select a cloud service which has the high level of trust and can meet both the user preferences and specific functional demands. This paper explores the multi-granularity selection standard of trust level, the users' preference calculation model, and the cloud service selection algorithm. First, the trust evaluation mechanisms among different entities in the human society are fitted, and the multi-granularity selection standard of trust levels based on Gaussian cloud transformation is constructed. Then, the calculation model of user preferences based on the cloud analytic hierarchy process is developed. Finally, the trusted cloud service selection algorithm based on two-step fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is proposed and experimentally validated.
