AB The recent development of Mobile Cloud Computing has helped in solving numerous real-life problems. The rate of growth of mobile devices has been increasing at a very high pace. Mobile devices have made substantial contributions in managing emergency situations. Owing to the mobility of mobile devices, cloudlets, and their intermittent connectivity, it may become very difficult to handle emergency situations. To address this problem, a transmission model is proposed for mobile cloudlet systems, where a mobile device is used to designate a cloudlet by using the Borda scores Method and the mobile device can offload a part of its application to this cloudlet. The simulation results demonstrated that the proposed work makes a significant comtribution toward alleviating the problems associated with emergency situations.
