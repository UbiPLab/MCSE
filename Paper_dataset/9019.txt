AB Fujitsu has embarked on migrating its internal systems integrated on a public cloud service, aiming to minimize system operation costs, as well as the cost and period of the development of new applications. In order to migrate the systems efficiently to a public cloud while ensuring operational security and safety, we have developed an internal cloud service. It can address various technical challenges in cloud computing, such as security enhancement as well as the development of a network environment for connecting to the cloud service (VPN connection), common shared infrastructure services, system-wide integrated infrastructure monitoring, and operational automation. An internal pilot system was introduced to assess and evaluate the migration operation, and we verified that the internal cloud service could achieve a 30% reduction in the cost of operating the infrastructure, while the new infrastructure would be introduced in a shorter period (to two weeks from four months). These are part of the efforts to integrate the internal systems on the FUJITSU Cloud Service K5, the core of FUJITSU Digital Business Platform MetaArc. This paper describes the initiative to develop the internal cloud service and the evaluation of the system migration using the pilot system, with its results. The paper also presents the total cloud-migration plan for Fujitsu's own internal systems, and the expected effects.
