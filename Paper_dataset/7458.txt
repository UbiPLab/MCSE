AB Managing and applying penalties has become a critical issue for Cloud Computing. In this paper, the authors investigate this issue and present the most frequently used definitions of service level agreements (SLA) penalty functions. They identify the characteristics of these functions by highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. They survey and analyze various penalty calculation and availability calculation methods of cloud providers. Then, they propose a Novel Penalty Model for computing the penalty cost of the violations and present formalization for the penalty concerned. They also propose a business model for cloud providers to manage their profit. An example application will be presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Finally, the paper notes some challenges and future research directions.
