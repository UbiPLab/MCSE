AB In this paper, we study on how to construct an authenticated key exchange protocol in a device based authentication setting where an user who has a PUF-based device and its multi-factor authenticators desires to mutually authenticate a server. Generally, in a secure multi-factor authentication schemes, any adversary cannot impersonates a valid users unless A fully corrupts all multi-factor authenticators. However, in recent PUF-based device authenticated key exchange schemes, we observe a new impersonation attack that any adversary with only PU F's output is always able to impersonate any user. We first analyze how recent schemes are vulnerable against the new attack. Then we build a secure PUF-based device authenticated key exchange (PDAKE) with provable result. Since in our PDAE, user's device is an important authenticator, it is well applicable to establish a secure channel in multi-factor based Fl DO (fast identification online) or cloud setting service like storage and e-mail services.
