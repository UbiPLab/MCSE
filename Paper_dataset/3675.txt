ID FACE RECOGNITION; EXECUTION
AB Mobile communication and handheld devices are currently extremely popular, and provide people with convenient and instant platforms for social networking. However, existing social networking services cannot offer efficient human-machine interfaces or intuitive user experiences. Mobile users must manually input account information and find targets from search results when attempting to add someone to their friend list on social networking sites, such as Facebook and Twitter. Additionally, mobile users may not be able to identify correct targets because some usernames are identical. Typos may occur during the input process due to unfamiliar identifiers, further increasing the total operation time. To encourage social initiation between mobile users, we design an instant social networking framework, called SocialYou, to minimize the startup time based on mobile cloud computing. SocialYou proposes an efficient architecture and innovative human-machine interfaces to alleviate the complexity and difficulty for mobile users using handheld devices. In particular, we implement an Android-based prototype to verify the feasibility and superiority of SocialYou. The experimental results show that SocialYou outperforms the existing methods and saves substantial amounts of operation time for mobile social networking.
