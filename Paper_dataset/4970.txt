AB Cloud computing provides different computing services delivered to user over the internet. In the presence of consuming amount of multimedia content in the cloud, the requirement for computerized systems to protect owners against unauthorized use of their content. It's vet difficult to process personal data in cloud securely . There are so roam of system accessible that gives simple approach to altering, distributing or. then again transferring multimedia content which might prompts security issue. In this proposed work. various multimedia content can be secure like video. image, songs etc. This proposed system has two methods: i) method for creating signature, and compared signature of multimedia content using hashing algorithm. Signature method is used to denote multimedia object's signature and hashing algorithm compares signature of original objects and suspected objects which helps to find unauthorized multimedia content. This paper gives the method to provide security for multimedia content in the cloud system.
