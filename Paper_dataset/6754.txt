ID NETWORKS
AB Vehicles have embedded software dedicated to diverse functionality ranging from driving assistance to entertainment. Vehicle manufacturers often need to perform updates on software installed on vehicles. Software updates can either be pushed by the manufacturer to install fixes, or be requested by vehicle owners to upgrade some functionality. We propose an architecture for distributing software updates on vehicles based on SDN and cloud computing. We show that using SDN, the emergent networking paradigm, which provides on-demand network programmability, adds substantial flexibility for deploying software updates on vehicles. We propose solutions for how vehicular networks can be modeled as connectivity graphs that can be used as input for the SDN architecture. After constructing graphs, we present an SDN-based solution where different frequency bands are assigned to different graph edges to improve the network performance.
