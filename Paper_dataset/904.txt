   recommendation Model
AB With the deepening of global economic integration, overseas Chinese education has attracted much attention. How to retrieve resources that meet user's personalized needs has become a key issue in the recommendation model of overseas Chinese education. Thus, a cloud synergetic recommendation model for overseas Chinese education is proposed in this paper to overcome this issue. Firstly, a user vector space with fine granularity representation is constructed by introducing multi-knowledge source emotional metaphor information. Secondly, considering the synergetic interaction among various user features, a synergetic user group recognition method based on synergetic theory is proposed. Finally, in order to improve the efficiency of resource acquisition, a recommendation model of Chinese education based on cloud computing is presented.
