AB In integrating and realigning the applied skills training at Minnan Normal University (MNNU), we analyzed the current situation and problems in the teaching of the Computer Networks course based on national standards on teaching quality and the Engineering Education Accreditation standards of China. Guided by a self-developed educational management system, teaching experimentation platform and questionnaire survey system, based in a cloud computing platform, we adopted a problem-oriented research method to explore comprehensive teaching reform from four perspectives: teaching methods, teacher development, resource guarantees and continual improvement. The teaching reform cases show that the students' ability to solve problems was significantly improved, and the goal of cultivating student knowledge, ability and quality has been achieved.
