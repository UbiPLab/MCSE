AB This paper aims to present the results obtained in an innovation teaching project on team work, new technologies and participatory methodologies in the university environment. The main research objective has been to explore the use that the so-called Google Generation (g-Google) makes of the Web 2.0 tools in the elaboration of their assignments at University. We proposed students to carry out a follow-up academic activity using the Google Drive tool. We start from the assumption that the proposed activity would allow the teacher to be closer to the students of the g-Google that are beginning university, because it is a working technological tool in the web. In order to obtain comparative results, we developed the same experience with students from the pre-Google or X Generation.
   We conducted online surveys and discussion groups with both students and teachers participating in the activity to explore the possibilities of use of the Web for collaborative work and the possibilities of the Web 2.0 for improving participatory methodologies in University classes. The results of the experience demystify the common belief that young students who are beginning University today have extensive knowledge of Internet resources, at least pertaining to the use of the Web 2.0 for university assignments.
