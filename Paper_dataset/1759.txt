AB The new mobile edge network architecture has been required for an increasing amount of traffic, quality requirements, advanced driver assistance system for autonomous driving and new cloud computing demands on highway. This article proposes a hierarchical cloud computing architecture to enhance performance by using adaptive data load distribution for buses that play the role of edge computing server. A vehicular dynamic cloud is based on wireless architecture including Wireless Local Area Network and Long Term Evolution Advanced communication is used for data transmission between moving buses and cars. The main advantages of the proposed architecture include both a reduction of data loading for top layer cloud server and effective data distribution on traffic jam highway where moving vehicles require video on demand (VOD) services from server. Through the description of real environment based on NS-2 network simulation, we conducted experiments to validate the proposed new architecture. Moreover, we show the feasibility and effectiveness for the connected car media service on highway.
