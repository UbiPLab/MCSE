AB Cloud computing is one of the new age technologies which has great prominent factor in the development of the enterprises and markets. The major exertion in the cloud computing is related to the resource being allocated. The optimal resource allocation is one which allocates the best suitable cluster resources for the task to execute with consideration of the different parameters, such as time, cost, and scalability, makespan, reliability, availability, throughput, resource utilization and so on. In this paper, a resource allocation optimization method in the cloud computing based on the exponential lion algorithm is proposed. The exponential lion based resource allocation for cloud computing taken into account saves the execution time, run time, and improves the revenue for the cloud provider. The proposed E-Lion based resource allocation approaches are compared with the PSO, SL-PSO, and Lion using the performance measures profit, CPU utilization rate, and memory utilization rate. The simulations of the experiments show that the algorithm in this paper has improved the algorithm performance efficiently with profit maximal profit of 38.74 and minimal CPU and memory utilization rate of 0.00031, and 0.00036 respectively.
