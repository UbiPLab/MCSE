AB Cloud data storage outsourcing has emerged as a service that can facilitate data owners (DOs) to store their data remotely. Outsourcing health, educational, financial, multimedia data to cloud storage server is beneficial as it eliminate the burden of initial infrastructure setup and maintenance costs. However data storage security and integrity remains challenging due to lack of control and physical possession over the data by the DOs. In this paper we present a lightweight auditing method for integrity verification and deduplication of outsourced data. The proposed scheme combines hashing and symmetric encryption with improved distributed hash table data structure which reduces the communication and computation overhead for integrity verification and also enables efficient dynamic operations of the data. The storage cost is drastically decreased by deduplication using the combined techniques of convergent encryption and filters. The outcome of the proposed methodology demonstrates that this light weight data audit protocol outperforms the other state of art schemes in computation, communication and storage costs.
