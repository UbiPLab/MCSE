AB Searching a keyword using an encryption method allows one to upload strongly encrypted documents on the cloud environment and it facilitate the query to locate the data on the server without need of the documents to be decrypted before doing the searching. In this proposal we have proposed novel secure and efficient keyword searching that produces the result based on the matching data items in the ranked order. Unlike other previous methods our searching complexity is sub linear to the total documents that are relevant to the keywords. This research shows that proposed approach is proved to be secured against the adaptive chosen-keyword attacks and it proves that our proposed approach is highly efficient and ready to implement in the real world cloud systems.
