AB In the computing world, the digital transformation of data grows exponentially with every year. However, these situations are predominantly tackled by leading enterprises through by adopting a hybrid IT model. This model effectively supports the organization through strategic design to provide standard delivery to customers from independent multi-sourced entities. An experimental design method is applied using hybrid IT architecture with gene-based cryptomata (HITAGC) which is well suited to real-time cloud environments to store and retrieve the cloud space data efficiently. The CSC primarily relies on the service of CSP to keep their confidential data, and this system ultimately uses the PKC crypts. To address this security demand, we propose two different schemes such as HITAGC-PKC and hybrid HITAGC. The first model is designed to generate robust asymmetric keys for the Internet of Things, and the other hybrid HITAGC is for efficient sharing of big data over the cloud in a secure manner. The performance of these crypts is compared with the traditional systems like standard RSA, ESRKGS, SED2, EDCon, and AES.
