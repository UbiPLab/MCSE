AB Debate on big data analytics has earned a remarkable interest in industry as well as academia due to knowledge, information and wisdom extraction from big data. Big data and cloud computing are two most important trends that are defining the new emerging analytical tools. Big data has various applications in different fields like traffic control, weather forecasting, fraud detection, security, education enhancement and health care. Extraction of knowledge from large amount of data has become a challenging task. Similarly, big data analysis can be used for effective decision making in healthcare by some modification in existing machine learning algorithms. In this paper, drawbacks of existing machine learning algorithms are summarized for big data analysis in healthcare.
