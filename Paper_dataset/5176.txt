AB In this paper, we propose a distributed joint computation offloading and resource allocation optimization (JCORAO) scheme in heterogeneous networks with mobile edge computing. An optimization problem is formulated to provide the optimal computation offloading strategy policy, uplink subchannel allocation, uplink transmission power allocation, and computation resource scheduling. The optimization problem is decomposed into two sub-problems due to the NP-hard property. In order to analyze the offloading strategy, a sub-algorithm named distributed potential game is built. The existence of Nash equilibrium is proved. To jointly allocate uplink subchannel, uplink transmission power, and computation resource for the offloading mobile terminals, a sub-algorithm named cloud and wireless resource allocation algorithm is designed. The solutions for subchannel allocation consist of uniform zero frequency reuse method without interference and fractional frequency reuse method based on Hungarian and graph coloring with interference. A distributed JCORAO scheme is proposed to solve the optimization problem by the mutual iteration of the two sub-algorithms. Simulation results show that the distributed JCORAO scheme can effectively decrease the energy consumption and task completion time with lower complexity.
