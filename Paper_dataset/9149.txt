AB This paper proposes a distributed strategy for region-growing segmentation of arbitrarily large images. The strategy is suited for most distributed architectures, including cloud-computing environments. It focuses on handling very large data and tackles the main problem of tiled-based segmentation: artifacts that occur in the segments adjacent to tile borders. Our proposal is to use a specific indexing mechanism and a hierarchical stitching method to suppress segmentation artifacts. The strategy was validated by a series of experiments carried out on a virtual cluster in a commercial cloud-computing infrastructure, over WorldView-2 images of different sizes. The experiments demonstrated that the proposed strategy is able to eliminate tile-based segmentation artifacts. The experimental analysis further showed that the strategy brings significant gains in terms of processing time, particularly for very large images, as more processing units are added to the distributed processing infrastructure.
