AB Aims: Cloud Computing is a set of IT Services that are provided to a customer over a network and these services are delivered by third party provider who owns the infrastructure. It is used not only for storing data, but also the outsourced data can be shared by multiple users. Due to this there exists a problem in integrity. Materials and methods: The objective is to provide security to the data stored in the public cloud. Several mechanisms have been designed to support public auditing on shared data stored in the cloud. Results: With the privacy preserving mechanism, the public auditor audits and verify the integrity of the shared data in the cloud without seeing the data called as public auditing. Along with public auditing security is improved to the data in the public cloud. Conclusion: Normally the data is stored only in a single server. But, Here multiple servers are used for storing data for security purpose.
