AB With the increasing demands for cloud resources, the task to keep it balanced with supply at all times becomes especially challenging. However, most of existing mechanisms focus on auction-based allocation of cloud resources rather than balancing the demands for cloud resources. In order to deal with this problem, this paper presents the problem of cloud resources consumption shifting between two different time intervals in a formularized manner, and then puts forward a cloud resources consumption shifting scheme with three-tier architecture. Users participating in the scheme, however, are motivated to get extra rewards by shifting certain consumption quantity from high to low demand time intervals. So, taking into account the fact that value ranges of individual shifting costs vary with different geographic areas, this scheme first allocates rewards to agencies in different geographic areas in the way of equilibrium, and then applies a strictly proper rule to reward users according to their contributions. In addition, the paper theoretically proves that the scheme is equipped with economic properties such as equilibrium, individual rationality, budget balance, and truthfulness. Finally, extensive simulation results show that the proposed scheme owns the resources shifting efficiency and computational traceability, and it can generate higher and more stable social rewards than the common scheme with two-tier architecture.
