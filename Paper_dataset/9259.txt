AB Managing the large dimensions of data processed in distributed systems that are formed by datacentres and mobile devices has become a challenging issue with an important impact on the end-user. Therefore, the management process of such systems can be achieved efficiently by using uniform overlay networks, interconnected through secure and efficient routing protocols. The aim of this article is to advance our previous work with a novel trust model based on a reputation metric that actively uses the social links between users and the model of interaction between them. We present and evaluate an adaptive model for the trust management in structured overlay networks, based on a Mobile Cloud architecture and considering a honeycomb overlay. Such a model can be useful for supporting advanced mobile market-share e-Commerce platforms, where users collaborate and exchange reliable information about, for example, products of interest and supporting ad-hoc business campaigns
