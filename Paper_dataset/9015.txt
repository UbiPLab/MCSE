AB In recent years, new digital technologies have been introduced into our business and social environments, causing a major change that is recognized as the digital transformation. To better adapt to this trend, in 2015 Fujitsu launched FUJITSU Digital Business Platform MetaArc (hereafter, MetaArc), designed to integrate the latest information and communications technologies (ICTs) such as cloud computing, mobile technology, big data (analytics), the Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (Al). MetaArc is a platform that realizes a seamless collaboration between two kinds of systems-those that create new innovations through connecting people and the physical environment (Systems of Engagement, or SoE) and those that enhance the efficiency of enterprise systems (Systems of Record, or SoR). Together, they make it possible to respond to changes in the business environment quickly and flexibly. MetaArc also offers a series of products useful for making a business grow. This paper introduces FUJITSU Cloud Service K5, the core cloud platform for MetaArc. It then outlines the platform's various component services and products and describes our cloud-centered strategies and efforts to maximize the value provided to our customers.
