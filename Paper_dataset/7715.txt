AB Resource sharing, multi-tenant interference and bursty workloads in cloud computing lead to high tail-latency that severely affects user quality of experience (QoE), where response latency is a critical factor. A lot of research efforts are dedicated to reducing high tail-latency and improving user QoE, such as software-defined cloud computing (SDC). However, the traditional availability analysis of cloud computing captures the pure failure-repair behavior with user QoE ignored. In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework, experience availability, to properly assess the effectiveness of SDC while taking into account both availability and response latency simultaneously. We review the related work on availability models and methods of cloud systems, and discuss open problems for evaluating experience availability in SDC. We also show some of our preliminary results to demonstrate the feasibility of our ideas.
