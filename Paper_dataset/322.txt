AB In this paper, end devices are considered here as agent, which makes its decisions on whether the network will offload the computation tasks to the edge devices or not. To tackle the resource allocation and task offloading, paper formulated the computation resource allocation problems as a sum cost delay of this framework. An optimal binary computational offloading decision is proposed and then reinforcement learning is introduced to solve the problem. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this reinforcement learning based scheme to minimize the offloading cost derived as computation cost and delay cost in industrial internet of things scenarios.
