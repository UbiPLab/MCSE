AB The article is devoted to generation techniques of the new public key crypto-systems, which are based on application of indistinguishability obfuscation methods to selected private key crypto-systems. The techniques are applied to symmetric key crypto-system and the target system is asymmetric one. As an input for our approach an implementation of symmetric block cipher with a given private-key is considered. Different obfuscation methods are subjected to processing. The target system would be treated as a public-key for newly created public crypto-system. The approach seems to be interesting from theoretical point of view. Moreover, it can be useful for information protection in a cloud-computing model.
