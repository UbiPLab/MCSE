AB Cloud computing is very useful for big data owner who doesn't want to manage IT infrastructure and big data technique details. However, it is hard for big data owner to trust multi-layer outsourced big data system in cloud environment and to verify which outsourced service leads to the problem. Similarly, the cloud service provider cannot simply trust the data computation applications. At last, the verification data itself may also leak the sensitive information from the cloud service provider and data owner. We propose a new three-level definition of the verification, threat model, corresponding trusted policies based on different roles for outsourced big data system in cloud. We also provide two policy enforcement methods for building trusted data computation environment by measuring both the MapReduce application and its behaviors based on trusted computing and aspect-oriented programming. To prevent sensitive information leakage from verification process, we provide a privacy-preserved verification method. Finally, we implement the TPTVer, a Trusted third Party based Trusted Verifier as a proof of concept system. Our evaluation and analysis show that TPTVer can provide trusted verification for multi-layered outsourced big data system in the cloud with low overhead.
