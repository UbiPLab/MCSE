AB Cloud computing platform has emerged to be a promising computing paradigm of recent time. Various applications from different domains having rigid deadline constraints are deployed in the cloud system for their respective benefits. Energy-efficient execution of these applications, meeting their deadline constraints is a challenge. Most of the existing research on the energy-efficient scheduling of these applications in the cloud domain consider a linear relationship between the energy consumption and the resource utilization of the system, and they focus on maximizing the utilization of resources to reduce the active number of computing nodes to minimize energy consumption. In this paper, we first devise a power consumption model for the cloud system which considers both the static and dynamic components of it and assumes a nonlinear relationship with utilization. Then we introduce the concept of urgent points in case of tasks having deadline in the context of a heterogeneous cloud computing environment. Then we propose two energy-efficient scheduling approaches, named UPS and UPS-ES designed based on the urgent points of the tasks and two threshold values of the host utilization. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted both for synthetic tasksets and Google cloud tracelogs. The results are compared with a state of the art scheduling policy and found that our policies perform significantly better than them, with an energy reduction of up to 42% while the deadline constraints of all the tasks are met.
