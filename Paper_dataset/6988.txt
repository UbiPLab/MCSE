AB As cloud computing services are presented via internet, the security and privacy are the key issues these services encounter. The open and distributive (decentralized) structure of cloud computing has changed this kind of computing into targets for hackers, cyber attackers and intruders. The relevant studies conducted by the International Data Research Institute reveal that security is the biggest challenge for cloud computing.
   For efficiency and more effectiveness of intrusion detection systems, they should take detection in real-time and online. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) using signature-based detection techniques (like snort) are careful and real-time intrusion systems, which can detect known attacks immediately and activate security mechanisms according to known attack patterns and known attach databank. However, these systems practically lose their efficiency against unknown attacks. Hence, this study has tried to present a hybrid method to enhance intrusion detection accuracy in cloud computing and the amount of production of false warnings in them.
