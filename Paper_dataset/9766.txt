AB With the rapid development of the Internet and information technology, cloud computing has been increasing in popularity. Cloud Storage Services, in which users can store their own files in the Internet space using cloud computing technology, have now become widely utilized. In this paper, we propose an improved cloud storage system for collaborative team-based usage, allowing collective content management between team members by modifying the current individual user-based cloud storage system. The proposed system implements the synchronization (sync) of the local folders of individual computers, and maintains the contents of team-managed folders in sync with the individual computers of the team members. In addition, the proposed system is an attempt to ensure efficiency and stability by making the most of available open source materials.
