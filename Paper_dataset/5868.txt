AB The technology of cloud computing is growing very quickly, thus it is required to manage the process of resource allocation. In this paper, load balancing algorithm based on honey bee behavior (LBA_HB) is proposed. Its main goal is distribute workload of multiple network links in the way that avoid underutilization and over utilization of the resources. This can be achieved by allocating the incoming task to a virtual machine (VM) which meets two conditions; number of tasks currently processing by this VM is less than number of tasks currently processing by other VMs and the deviation of this VM processing time from average processing time of all VMs is less than a threshold value. The proposed algorithm is compared with different scheduling algorithms; honey bee, ant colony, modified throttled and round robin algorithms. The results of experiments show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in terms of execution time, response time, makespan, standard deviation of load, and degree of imbalance.
