AB Currently, electricity consumption and feedback mechanisms are being widely researched in Internet of Things (IoT) areas to realise power consumption monitoring and management through the remote control of appliances. This paper aims to develop a smart electricity utilisation IoT platform with a deep belief network for electricity utilisation feature modelling. In the end node of electricity utilisation, a smart monitoring and control module is developed for automatically operating air conditioners with a gateway, which connects and controls the appliances through an embedded ZigBee solution. To collect electricity consumption data, a programmable smart IoT gateway is developed to connect an IoT cloud server of smart electricity utilisation via the Internet and report the operational parameters and working states. The cloud platform manages the behaviour planning functions of the energy-saving strategies based on the power consumption features analysed by a deep belief network algorithm, which enables the automatic classification of the electricity utilisation situation. Besides increasing the user's comfort and improving the user's experience, the established feature models provide reliable information and effective control suggestions for power reduction by refining the air conditioner operation habits of each house. In addition, several data visualisation technologies are utilised to present the power consumption datasets intuitively.
