AB The proliferation of ubiquitous sensing technology is bringing a rising number of the innovative models that have unique characteristics of the utility computing. These models have offered great opportunities to improve IT industries and business processes through the convergence of cloud computing and internet of things (IoT). Although this convergence establishes seamless intelligent interaction among physical and virtual entities, it has difficulty not only to meet the required level of quality of service(QoS) but also to satisfy the user's complex demands. As a result, the predisposition to create a dynamic service-oriented environment has become a fundamental design issue. The main objective of this study is to introduce a dynamic QoS provisioning framework (QoPF) for service-oriented IoT using backtracking search optimization algorithm (BSOA). The QoPF framework is proposed to maximize the composite service quality in IoT application layer by making a balance between service reliability and acceptable cost of the computational time. The effectiveness of the QoPF framework is evaluated using a number of performance metrics such as throughput, delay time, and jitter. The experimental results demonstrate that worthiness of the QoPF to meet QoS requirements more than other state-of-the-art techniques in the literature review.
