AB Background: Cloud computing is one among the unfathomable knowledge exploration in the field of Information Technology. A virgin as well as a task emerging area of study, cloud computing provides an innovative model for the distribution of multiple applications in various organizations. Methods: The development and growing popularity of cloud computing indicates the evolution in the way IT infrastructure and services are distributed and expended. This increased use of cloud computing resulted in resource problems which have to be solved for better usage of the clouds. In this paper, we present an efficient method for solving resource problems in the cloud using modified map reducing algorithm. Results: Here we employed a Map Reduce programming model with GA for distributed parallel computing and execution on a virtualization process which is used to detect non-sufficient reductions in the execution time and to detect the decrease in the computing time. Conclusions: GA is compared with existing methods such as Clustering large applications(CLARA), Partioning around medoids(PAM), Clustering large applications based on randomized search(CLARANS) in which the simulation results of GA aim on improving the solutions both in execution and computation.
