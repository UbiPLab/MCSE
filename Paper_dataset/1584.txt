AB In recent times, vehicular network research has attracted the attention of both researchers and the industry partly due to its potential applications in efficient traffic management, road safety, entertainment, etc. Resources such as communication, on-board unit, storage and computing units, and battery are generally installed in the vehicles participating in intelligent transportation systems. The need to maximize the utilization of these resources has also resulted in interest in cloud based vehicular networks (CVNs), an area of active research. This paper survey the CVNs literature published between 2010 and 2016. In addition, a taxonomy based on three main CVN categories, namely vehicular cloud computing (VCC), vehicle using cloud (VuC) and hybrid cloud (HC), is presented. In the taxonomy, we focus on related systems, architectures, applications and services. Although VCC has been extensively discussed in the literature, a comprehensive survey on the two other categories is lacking. Hence, this motivates our research. Through an extensive comparison of common characteristics among cloud computing, mobile cloud computing, VCC, VuC and HC and overview of the existing architectures, we present a conceptual HC architecture. Finally, we conclude the paper with open issues and challenges.
