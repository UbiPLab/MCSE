AB Fog Computing is also well known as Real-Time Edge Computing. It emerged from Cloud Computing and implemented closed to the end user's devices to deal with network latency. Big data services rely on the Internet of Things (IoT) systems to integrate heterogeneous devices and to deliver data to the central server for analytics. These big data in IoT is the enormous amount of data collected from IoT devices. Large number of IoT connected devices introduces new issues likes network latency, unstable bandwidth and unstable connectivity and many more issues which impact the performance and reliability of the system where big data services should be available on time. One of the possible solution which will effect the whole scenario is reasonable Fog Computing architecture, which addresses the issues of performance by shifting the computational load on to the edge devices. Finally, overall performance will be enhanced. The advancement of techniques and big data of this 5G era with low cost IoT devices implicitly introduced transition towards new paradigm of computing. The Big data collection, analysis and communication are highly impacted with inclusion of advanced IoT technologies. In this paper, authors have explored how Fog Computing enhances Big Data Analytics capabilities in Cloud - IoT architecture for smart devices of IoT environment.
