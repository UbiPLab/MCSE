AB The paper presents a new method for complexity determination to be used in new hyper-hybrid AD HOC cloud computing. A large body of research has been devoted to identifying the complexity of network structures. The study of complex networks is a young and active area of scientific research inspired largely by the empirical study of real-world networks, such as computer and social networks. The new method enables quantifying the complexity of a new hyper hybrid AD HOC cloud network based on presenting the network nodes in the Cartesian coordinates, converting to polar coordinates, and calculating the fractal dimension. The results suggest that the method can be used to determine the complexity for any type of the network.
