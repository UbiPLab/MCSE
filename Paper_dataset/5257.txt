AB While augment reality applications are becoming popular, more and more data-hungry and computation-intensive tasks are delay-sensitive. Mobile edge computing is expected to an effective solution to meet the low latency demand. In contrast to previous work on mobile edge computing, which mainly focus on computation offloading, this paper introduces a new concept of task caching. Task caching refers to the caching of completed task application and their related data in edge cloud. Then, we investigate the problem of joint optimization of task caching and offloading on edge cloud with the computing and storage resource constraint. We formulate this problem as mixed integer programming which is hard to solve. To solve the problem, we propose efficient algorithm, called task caching and offloading (TCO), based on alternating iterative algorithm. Finally, the simulation experimental results show that our proposed TCO algorithm outperforms others in terms of less energy cost.
