AB In cloud computing, cloud users can upload their data to cloud storage server in order to save local storage and access their data from anywhere. However, cloud storage service also brings serious security issues. Cloud users should be convinced of the correctness of their data stored remotely in the cloud. Thus, a reliable auditing scheme is desired to help cloud users check the integrity of their remote data. In this paper, we first propose an efficient cloud auditing scheme for multi-cloud storage systems, which can also preserve the privacy. Then, we extend our auditing scheme to support dynamic auditing and batch auditing for both multiple cloud users and multiple cloud service providers (CSPs), which makes the scheme more practical and efficient. Security analysis shows that our auditing scheme is provably secure. Our experiments indicate that our solution is efficient and significantly relieves the computation burden of both third party auditor (TPA) and CSP.
