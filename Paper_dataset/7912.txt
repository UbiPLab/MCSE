AB Acquisition of high density point clouds using terrestrial laser scanners (TLSs) has become commonplace in geomorphic science. The derived point clouds are often interpolated onto regular grids and the grids compared to detect change (i.e. erosion and deposition/advancement movements). This procedure is necessary for some applications (e.g. digital terrain analysis), but it inevitably leads to a certain loss of potentially valuable information contained within the point clouds. In the present study, an alternative methodology for geomorphological analysis and feature detection from point clouds is proposed. It rests on the use of the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), applied to TLS data for a rock glacier front slope in the Swiss Alps. The proposed methods allowed the detection and isolation of movements directly from point clouds which yield to accuracies in the following computation of volumes that depend only on the actual registered distance between points. We demonstrated that these values are more conservative than volumes computed with the traditional DEM comparison. The results are illustrated for the summer of 2015, a season of enhanced geomorphic activity associated with exceptionally high temperatures. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
