AB The ubiquitous and timely access to personal health records help physicians to take critical decisions and save lives. Cloud computing has a potential to provide ubiquitous and on-demand instant access to common pool of shared resources and services to various stakeholders involved in electronic healthcare industry such as patients, healthcare professionals, insurance companies, etc. The speedy evolution and adoption of cloud computing in electronic healthcare systems have inevitably raised concerns enveloping outsourced data in a myriad of safety issues. In this paper, cryptanalysis of Qin's scheme is performed breaching confidentiality of their scheme. We further proposed a lightweight and pairing free single-hop unidirectional certificateless proxy re-encryption scheme based on elliptic curves for secure sharing of mobile personal health records with public cloud competent for low-power mobile devices. In certificateless proxy re-encryption, patients encrypt the data with their public keys before outsourcing to the cloud and cloud resident semitrusted proxy further re-encrypts into ciphertext under intended recipient's public key without learning anything about encrypted message. We prove its security through formal analysis against chosen ciphertext attack in the random oracle model. Our proposed scheme is more efficient and suitable for low-power mobile devices in comparison with existing schemes.
