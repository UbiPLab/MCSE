AB Because mobile cloud computing has many advantages such as large storage capacity, low cost and scalability, most data owners prefer to store their data on cloud servers to share with other users. However, the shared data in remote cloud servers is out of data owner's control and exposes to lots of security problems such as data integrity. So far, more and more auditing schemes have been proposed to verify data integrity, but in most of them, blocks are stored in plain text and leaked the privacy of data. In addition, data owner is in charge of generating block tags, which no doubt increases computation burden of data owner. In this paper, we firstly propose a secure and lightweight integrity verification scheme for Internet of Things (IoT) mobile terminal devices. Secondly, we design a data sharing method for data owner to share cloud data with authorized users. Finally, we redesign Merkle Hash Tree that can preserve the information of block node fresh and improve security in integrity verification of the shared data. As a result, the integrity verification scheme guarantees privacy and efficiency of sharing data on cloud and achieves lightweight operations of data owners. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
