DE elastic cloud; performance; power consumption
AB Cloud computing is a novel paradigm capable of rationalizing the use of computational resources by means of outsourcing and virtualization. Elasticity is one of the most attractive features of cloud computing. Elastic clouds are able to adapt to workload changes by provisioning and de-provisioning resources in an autonomic manner, such that at each point in time the available resources match the current demand as closely as possible. However, elasticity adds complexity, which makes quantitative analysis of cloud performance and power consumption difficult. Such analysis is required to evaluate and quantify the cost-benefit of a strategy portfolio and the quantitative runtime performance and power consumption experienced by cloud-users. In this study, we present a comprehensive analytical approach to performance and power consumption analysis of elastic clouds. Several metrics are defined and evaluated: expected task completion time, power consumption rate, and task rejection rate under different load conditions, elasticity intensities, and error intensities. To validate the proposed approach, we obtain experimental data through a real-world cloud and conduct a confidence interval analysis. The analysis results suggest the perfect coverage of theoretical results by corresponding experimental confidence intervals. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
