AB These last years, an increasingly significant number of traffic accidents caused by a malaise at the steering wheel was observed. The management of this kind of phenomenon is difficult and presents a real challenge. Given this fact, the authors try, in this paper, to propose a work which, thanks to new technologies, let's take care of people taken malaise while driving. Thus, they will provide a new service called HAaaS "Health-Assistance as a Service" which will allow the detection of malaise and the management of the driver and the vehicle. Moreover, the aspect of co-operation will be guaranteed thanks to a mechanism that the authors will use and that they call the Help/rescue mechanism.
