AB In order to solve the problem that the information sharing level of educational resources is not high in the cloud computing environment, it is required to improve the design of educational resource information sharing algorithm in cloud computing environment. Therefore, an educational resource information sharing algorithm based on big data association mining and quasi-linear regression analysis is proposed. In this algorithm, information fusion and comprehensive measurement index system reconstruction are performed to resource distribution information of the educational resource database based on attribute type and semantic ontology characteristics. The simulation results show that the algorithm performs well in convergence during resource scheduling in educational resource information sharing and can provide average sharing level up to 0.9247, so this algorithm can be adopted to allocate resources in a balance way.
