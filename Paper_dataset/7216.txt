AB Considering the new requirements of the services encapsulation and virtualization access of manufacturing resources for cloud manufacturing (CMfg), this paper presents a services encapsulation and virtualization access model for manufacturing machine by combining the Internet of Things techniques and cloud computing. Based on this model, some key enabling technologies, such as configuration of sensors, active sensing of real-time manufacturing information, services encapsulation, registration and publishing method are designed. By implementing the proposed services encapsulation and virtualization access model to manufacturing machine, the capability of the machine could be actively perceived, the production process is transparent and can be timely visited, and the virtualized machine could be accessed to CMfg platform through a loose coupling, 'plug and play' manner. The proposed model and methods will provide the real-time, accurate, value-added and useful manufacturing information for optimal configuration and scheduling of large-scale manufacturing resources in a CMfg environment.
