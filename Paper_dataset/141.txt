AB Dynamic provisioning of computational resources in cloud computing system is a challenging problem. With many VMs being deployed in clouds, managing so much resources to stable work becomes a critical problem. Therefore, how to meet the different quality of service (QoS), we consider the service quality requirements is very important. In this paper, we address this problem. We first establish a QoS scheduling model by incorporating the cloud characteristics, and then, we develop a task scheduling objects to ensure faults can be tolerated during the task exaction. Finally, we proposed a QoS-aware scheduling algorithm, QoS-DPSO, to satisfy the QoS required in cloud computing systems. For the target requirements of QoS requirement, we take the time, reliability and cost as a single object problem. Experimental results show that QoS-DPSO can effectively improve the performance and obtain the high reliability.
