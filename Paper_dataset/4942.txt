AB Nowadays, mobile services (applications) running on terminal devices are becoming more and more computation-intensive. Offloading the service requests from terminal devices to cloud computing can be a good solution, but it would put a high burden on the network. Edge computing is an emerging technology to solve this problem, which places servers at the edge of the network. Dynamic scheduling of offloaded service requests in mobile edge computing systems is a key issue. It faces challenges due to the dynamic nature and uncertainty of service request patterns. In this article, we propose a Dynamic Service Request Scheduling (DSRS) algorithm, which makes request scheduling decisions to optimize scheduling cost while providing performance guarantees. The DSRS algorithm can be implemented in an online and distributed way. We present mathematical analysis which shows that the DSRS algorithm can achieve arbitrary tradeoff between scheduling cost and performance. Experiments are also carried out to show the effectiveness of the DSRS algorithm.
