AB In Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs), because of the selfishness of the vehicles, the resource allocation in VANET has become one of the primary tasks. Exploiting the Road Side Units (RSUs), which constructs the Cloud Computing environment, provides more data access opportunities and stable communication time for the vehicles. We investigated the cloud resource allocation for data access with noncooperative game based on a Gauss-Seidel iteration method. We further proposed a repeated game scheme, which can approximately achieve the near Pareto-optimal flow allocation among the vehicles. Considering the vehicles' irrational behavior, a punishment strategy was designed to prevent the vehicles from behavior deviation. The analysis based on these models lays a theoretical method foundation on cloud resource allocation process. The validity of the modeling and the accuracy of the analysis were verified through the extensive simulations, which also guide the future design of more sophisticated cloud resource allocation schemes.
