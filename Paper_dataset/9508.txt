AB MUSA (MUlti-cloud Secure Applications) is an EU H2020 funded research project which is aimed at ensuring security in multi-cloud environments. The main goal of MUSA is to support the lifecycle of applications with strict security requirements over heterogenous cloud resources. MUSA will result in a security framework that includes security-by-design mechanisms as well as runtime security monitoring and enforcement to mitigate security incidents.
