AB The integration of cloud and Internet of Things (IoT), named CloudIoT, has been considered as an enabler for many different applications. However, the suspicion about the security issue is one main concern that some organizations hesitate to adopt such technologies while some just ignore the security issue while integrating the CloudIoT into their business. Therefore, given the numerous choices of cloud-resource providers and IoT devices, how to evaluate their security level becomes an important issue to promote the adoption of CloudIoT as well as reduce the business security risks. To solve this problem, considering the importance of the business data in CloudIoT, we develop an end-to-end security assessment framework based on software defined network (SDN) to evaluate the security level for the given CloudIoT offering. Specially, in order to simplify the network controls and focus on the analysis about the data flow through CloudIoT, we develop a three-layer framework by integrating SDN and CloudIoT, which consists of 23 different indicators to describe its security features. Then, the interviews from industry and academic are carried out to understand the importance of these features for the overall security. Furthermore, given the relevant evidences from the CloudIoT offering, the Google Brillo and Microsoft Azure IoT Suite, our framework can effectively evaluate the security level which can help the consumers for their CloudIoT selection.
