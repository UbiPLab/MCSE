   Voluntary Aspect
AB One of the biggest challenges in cloud federations is how to express the federation level agreement (FLA) and voluntary aspect of the federation members and maintain the integrity of the organization. However, existing works are not able to present the cloud federation management aspect or implement these properties that distinguish cloud federation from other inter-cloud organizations. This paper bridges this gap by proposing a managed cloud federation architecture based on this subset of properties. The key component of this architecture is the federation manager that controls, tracks, evaluates, and predicts the behavior of the federation. In order to ensure the effectiveness of the approach, the authors developed the Managed Federation Simulator to implement the proposed federation architecture on the SmartFed simulator and evaluate it through a set of scenarios on a real case study.
