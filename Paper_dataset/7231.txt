AB In this paper, we propose a server architecture recommendation and automatic performance verification technology, which recommends and verifies appropriate server architecture on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud with bare metal servers, container-based virtual servers and virtual machines. Recently, cloud services are spread, and providers provide not only virtual machines but also bare metal servers and container-based virtual servers. However, users need to design appropriate server architecture for their requirements based on three types of server performances, and users need much technical knowledge to optimize their system performance. Therefore, we study a technology that satisfies users' performance requirements on these three types of IaaS cloud. Firstly, we measure performance and start-up time of a bare metal server, Docker containers, KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) virtual machines on OpenStack with changing number of virtual servers. Secondly, we propose a server architecture recommendation technology based on the measured quantitative data. A server architecture recommendation technology receives an abstract template of OpenStack Heat and function/performance requirements and then creates a concrete template with server specification information. Thirdly, we propose an automatic performance verification technology that executes necessary performance tests automatically on provisioned user environments according to the template. We implement proposed technologies, confirm performance and show the effectiveness.
