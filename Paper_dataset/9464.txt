AB Cloud computing has immensely improved the computational prowess of corporates by offering dynamic allocation of resource being used and exponentially increasing the amount of data being processed. It has many benefits including reliability, security and ease of maintenance. However cloud is still an evolving technology and needs focus majorly on the areas of Resource Management and Energy management. This paper relates to the previous work done on load balancing model using firefly algorithm(FA) in cloud computing and energy conservation for dynamic voltage frequency scaling(DVFS) for computational cloud. Here we have applied the benefits of both the papers and the output obtained is also compared with Adaptive genetic algorithm model. Thus enabled us to achieve optimal management of cloud resources and effectively negates any adverse environmental impacts to a large extent.
