AB Many organizations are seeking to contract services from cloud computing with many cloud services available and numerous criteria that should be counted in the selection process. Therefore, the selection process of cloud services can be considered as a type of multi-criteria decision analysis problems with multiples stakeholders. In this paper a framework for selecting cloud services taking into account consensus and using single valued neutrosophic numbers for indeterminacy represention is presented. The proposed framework is composed of five activities: framework, gathering parameters, eliciting preferences, computing consensus degree, advice generation, rating alternatives and cloud service selection. The model includes automatic search mechanisms for conflict areas and recommendations to the experts to bring closer their preferences. An illustrative example that corroborates the applicability of the model is presented. The paper ends with conclusion and further areas or research recommendations.
