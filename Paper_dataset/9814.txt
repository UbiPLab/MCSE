AB This paper studies the routing problem in energy-efficient networks for cloud computing. We propose a robust routing algorithm to reach the higher network energy efficiency, which is based on optimization problem. To attain the highly energy-efficient routing in energy-efficient networks for cloud computing, the link of low utilization is turned into the sleeping state to save the network energy. At the same time, the low link traffic is aggregated to the link with high utilization to enhance the link utilization and to sleep the links as many as possible. We present an optimized link sleeping method to maximize the number of the sleeping links. By targeting the network robustness, a weight adaptive strategy is brought forth to reduce the link congestion and enhance the robustness of the network. Simulation results indicate that our algorithm is effective and feasible to achieve energy-efficient networks for cloud computing.
