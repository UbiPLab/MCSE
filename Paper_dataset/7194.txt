AB In order to store and analyze the increasing data in recent years, big data techniques are applied to many fields such as healthcare, manufacturing, telecommunications, retail, energy, transportation, automotive, security, environment, etc. This work implements a city traffic state assessment system in cloud using a novel big data architecture. The proposed system provides the real-time busses location and real-time traffic state, especially the real-time traffic state nearby, through open data, cloud computing, bid data technology, clustering methods, and irregular moving average. With the high-scalability cloud technologies, Hadoop and Spark, the proposed system architecture is first implemented successfully and efficiently. Next, we utilize irregular moving average and clustering methods to find the area of traffic jam. Finally, three important experiments are performed. The first experiment indicates that the computing ability of Spark is better than that of Hadoop. The second experiment applies Spark to process bus location data under different number of executors. In the last experiment, we apply irregular moving average and clustering methods to efficiently find the area of traffic jam in Taiwan Boulevard which is the main road in Taichung city. Based on these experimental results, the provided system services are present via an advanced web technology.
