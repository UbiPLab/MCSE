AB We propose Cloud Baking, a collaborative rendering architecture for dynamic Web3D scenes. In our architecture, the cloud renderer renders the scene with the global illumination (GI) information in a GI map; the web-based client renderer renders the scene with ambient lighting only and blends it with the GI map received from the cloud for the final scene. This approach allows the users to interact with the web scene and change the scene dynamically through the web interface end, yet move the computationally heavy tasks of global illumination computation to the cloud. A challenge we face is the interaction delay that causes the frames rendered on the cloud and the client to go out of sync. We propose to use 3D warping and a hole-filling algorithm designed for GI map to predict the late GI map. We show both quantitatively and visually the quality of the GI map produced using our method. Our prediction algorithm allows us to further reduce the frequency at which the GI map is computed and sent from the server, reducing both computational needs and bandwidth usage.
