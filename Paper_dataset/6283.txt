AB Ubiquitous computing and The Internet-of-Things (IoT) grow rapidly in today's life and evolving to Self-organizing systems (SoS). A unified and scalable information processing and communication methodology is required. In this work, mobile agents are used to merge the IoT with Mobile and Cloud environments seamless. A portable and scalable Agent Processing Platform (APP) provides an enabling technology that is central for the deployment of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) in strong heterogeneous networks including the Internet. A large-scale use-case deploying Multi-agent systems in a distributed heterogeneous seismic sensor and geodetic network is used to demonstrate the suitability of the MAS and platform approach. The MAS is used for earthquake monitoring based on a new incremental distributed learning algorithm applied to seismic station data, which can be extended by ubiquitous sensing devices like smart phones. Different (mobile) agents perform sensor sensing, aggregation, local learning and prediction, global voting and decision making, and the application.
