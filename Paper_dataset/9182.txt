AB With the advent of cloud and virtualization technologies and the integration of various computer communication technologies, today's computing environments can provide virtualized high quality services. The network traffic has also continuously increased with remarkable growth. Software defined networking/network function virtualization (SDN/NFV) enhancing the infrastructure agility, thus network operators and service providers are able to program their own network functions on vendor independent hardware substrate. However, in order for the SDN/NFV to realize a profit, it must provide a new resource sharing and monitoring procedures among the regionally distributed and virtualized computers. In this paper, we proposes a NFV monitoring architecture based practical measuring framework for network performance measurement. We also proposes a end-to-end connectivity support platform across a whole SDN/NFV networks has not been fully addressed.
