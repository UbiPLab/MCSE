DE Load balancing; Cloud Computing; Lowest Completion Time
AB There are more than a huge number of nodes connected to web computing to provide various types of web services to provide the cloud clients. Limited numbers of nodes connected to the cloud computing have to execute more than a thousand or a million tasks at a time. So it is not so easy to execute all tasks at a particular time. Some nodes execute all tasks, so there is a need to balance all the tasks or loads at a time. Load balance minimizes the completion time as well as executes all the tasks in a particular way.
   There is no possibility to keep the same number servers in cloud computing to execute the same number tasks. Tasks those are to be executed in cloud computing would be more than the connected servers. Limited servers have to execute a million numbers of tasks.
   We propose an algorithm that some nodes execute the jobs, here jobs are greater than the nodes and balance all nodes to maximize the quality of services with load balancing.
