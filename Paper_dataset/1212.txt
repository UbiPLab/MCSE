AB Nowadays, the dynamics of variability marked by technologisation and digitisation cannot be underestimated. New technologies identified with Economy 4.0 affect almost every dimension of the modern world. The level of competitiveness of modern economies is determined by the implementation and diffusion of innovations based on new technologies. Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT), the Internet of Everything (IoE), hyperconnectivity, cloud computing applications and services, Big Data Analytics (BDA), Big-Dataas-a-Service (BDaaS), automation and robotisation are just a few of the technologies that the authors found worth looking at in more detail with regard to transport. Digital transformation is also a new opportunity as well as a challenge for business. This paper indicates the metamorphosis that transport has undergone as a result of the injection of new technologies. The presented material has been collected in the course of the source research carried out using the idiographic method. A critical analysis of available documents and literature, as well as digital sources, has made it possible to identify the benefits of injecting new technologies in transport as an effect of adaptability to the digital age.
