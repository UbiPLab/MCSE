AB With the development of cloud computing and wireless body area networks (WBANs), wearable equipments are able to become new intelligent terminals to provide services for users, which plays an important role to improve the human health-care service. However, The traditional WBANs devices have limited computing and storage capabilities. These restrictions limit the services that WBANs can provide to users. Thus the concept of Cloud-aided WBANs has been proposed to enhance the capabilities of WBANs. In addition, due to the openness of the cloud computing environment, the protection of the user's physiological information and privacy remains a major concern. In previous authentication protocols, few of them can protect the user's private information in insecure channel. In this paper, we propose a cloud-aided lightweight certificateless authentication protocol with anonymity for wireless body area networks. Our protocol ensures that no one can obtain user's real identity except for the network manager in the registration phase. Moreover, in the authentication phase, the network manager cannot know the user's real identity. Note that, through the security analysis, we can conclude that our protocol can provide stronger security protection of private information than most of existing schemes in insecure channel.
