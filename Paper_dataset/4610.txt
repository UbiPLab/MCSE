AB The data mining algorithm based on cloud computing is studied and analyzed in this paper. Firstly, the research status and background of the data mining algorithms based on cloud computing are introduced briefly. Secondly, the design of Hash algorithm under cellular neural network is introduced which is needed in this paper. Next, the design of wavelet data compression algorithm for wireless sensor networks is described. Finally, the experimental results and the optimization similarity analysis are obtained. The analysis results show that the data mining algorithm based on cloud computing constructed in this paper plays an important role in data mining, and can improve the data mining algorithm of cloud computing and the development level of cloud computing technology and big data technology to some extent.
