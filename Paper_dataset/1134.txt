AB This paper exhibits the outline and advancement of a pervasive remote monitoring system for the Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. The proposed system gathers various PD related information such as voice samples, gait information etc. and would empower in-home monitoring of early PD symptoms. We accomplished this objective by utilizing various wearable sensors technology, mobile computing system, Internet, cloud computing technologies. Such an incorporated framework guarantees the compelling and effective utilization of data gathered for evaluating early PD symptom's as well as identifies critical PD severity levels. In particular, the proposed system can evaluate PD patients' voice disorders or Dysphonia and thus enables doctors to detect patient's PD symptoms or severity levels. Trial comes about demonstrate that our proposed system achieves very high accuracy for detecting PD symptoms as compared to existing approaches.
