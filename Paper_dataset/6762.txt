AB The identification and resolution technology are the prerequisite for realizing identity consistency of physical-cyber space mapping in the Internet of Things (IoT). Face, as a distinctive noncoded and unstructured identifier, has especial advantages in identification applications. With the increase of face identification based applications, the requirements for computation, communication, and storage capability are becoming higher and higher. To solve this problem, we propose a fog computing based face identification and resolution scheme. Face identifier is first generated by the identification system model to identify an individual. Then, a fog computing based resolution framework is proposed to efficiently resolve the individual's identity. Some computing overhead is offloaded from a cloud to network edge devices in order to improve processing efficiency and reduce network transmission. Finally, a prototype system based on local binary patterns (LBP) identifier is implemented to evaluate the scheme. Experimental results show that this scheme can effectively save bandwidth and improve efficiency of face identification and resolution.
