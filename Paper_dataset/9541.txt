   Control and the Fully Homomorphic Encryption Technique
AB Cloud computing is one of the ideal information technology that expedite various opportunities like software requirements, web services, hardware specification and so on for corporations to developing the business with minimum cost also providing greater flexibility. Even though the cloud provides the different services, it bears new risk and challenges like security, privacy while accessing the information in the cloud. So, the secured cloud based information system is developed for managing the user details in the cloud environment. In this paper the secured cloud information system is managed using the Role and Identity based access control and the Fully Homomorphic encryption technique. The access control and authentication is achieved by using Access control module and user components in the cloud environment. Then the performance of the proposed system is evaluated using the promising case study.
