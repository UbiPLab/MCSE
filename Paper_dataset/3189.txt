AB Cloud computing offers a simple way to provide access to servers, storage, databases, and a broad set of application services over the Internet. Its popularity is growing spectacularly. Consequently, there is a need for strong authentication schemes, offering besides data privacy also identity privacy during these actions. Therefore, this paper presents 2 user-friendly protocols, called the autonomous, anonymous, and authenticationAAA1 and AAA2schemes, able to derive the required security material at user's side without the need of a secure channel between user and registration center. The protocol AAA2 has the added functionality to guarantee unforgeability and non-repudiation of the request. Only simple elliptic curve operations, together with hashes and symmetric key encryptions are used. The proposed protocols are 2-factor based, requiring the knowledge of the password and the possession of a correctly installed smartphone, and are very efficient to be executed on the smartphone because of a small amount of computations. As an application, we show how AAA1 can be utilized in a communication protocol for monitoring and AAA2 for charging and discharging of electrical vehicles with the smart grid. Moreover, these proposed solutions allow a much better performance, compared with the state of the art protocols in this field.
