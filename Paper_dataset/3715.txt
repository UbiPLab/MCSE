AB In this paper, we propose a skin care management support system that can provide easy intercommunication between patients and medical staff for optimal management of skin treatment and an aid to diagnosis. This system provides self-management and treatment advice for patients from medical staff. Our research is specially focused on the management of conditions such as psoriasis and melanoma. Although there exist systems have been developed for various medical applications, including some that provide self-monitoring via smartphones, the patient participation rate in using these applications has been low after initial use. This is because obtaining useful information regarding the diagnosis and treatment of disease without the support of medical staff is difficult. We propose a skin care management support system with an enhanced interaction method. It leverages a data synchronization mechanism to enable patients and medical staff to view simultaneously. The system environment is based on cloud computing environment, which provides secure communication by using an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) between patients and medical staff. Finally, we demonstrate the complete skin care management procedure for skin diseases using a smartphone-based portal service.
