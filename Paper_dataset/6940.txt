AB With the advances of networks and sensing technologies, it is possible to benefit from the surrounding environment's data in enhancing peoples' life. Currently, we have different types of networks such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), Vehicle Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs), Cellular Networks (CNs), and Social Networks (SNs) along with underlying computing such as Cloud computing. These types of networks provide huge data about the surrounding environments including weather information, peoples' relations, peoples' interest, and location information. This paper examines the suitability of hierarchal fuzzy logic controller in classifying the IoT data. The paper also tries to answer "if-else "questions about the effect of each of the input parameters. The authors' test case in this paper is related to the disease spreading prediction problem. This test case is highly important to the health care organizations. Different case studies are generated to examine the efficiency of the proposed framework and methodologies.
