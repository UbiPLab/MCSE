AB With the rapid demand for service-oriented computing in association with the growth of cloud computing technologies, large-scale virtualized data centers have been established throughout the globe. These huge data centers consume power at a large scale that results in a high operational cost. The massive carbon footprint from the energy generators is another great issue to deal global warming. It is essential to lower the rate of carbon emission and energy consumption as much as possible. The live-migration-enabled dynamic virtual machine consolidation results in high energy saving. But it also incurs the violation of service level agreement (SLA). Excessive migration may lead to performance degradation and SLA violation. The process of VM selection for migration plays a vital role in the domain of energy-aware cloud computing. Using VM selection policies, VMs are selected for migration. A new power-aware VM selection policy has been proposed in this research that helps in VM selection for migration. The proposed power-aware VM selection policy has been further evaluated using trace-based simulation environment.
