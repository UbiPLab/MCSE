ID AUGMENTED REALITY
AB The Creative Cities movement looks for creative solutions to environmental issues, or inventive ways for people. One of the main objectives of the Creative Cities is to create dynamic and attractive spaces to citizens. For this, information technology can (and should) help in creation of more dynamic environments. Augmented Reality is a technology that overlays virtual objects in the real world, and can be used for this purpose. One way to accomplish Augmented Reality is 3D reconstruction of the environment. This work presents a comparison of libraries for 3D reconstruction, with the objective of developing an application of RA using 3D reconstruction in the context of Creative Cities. In addition, this study also compares and analyzes the performance of virtualization tools (KVM and Virtual Box) when executing this type of application in a cloud infrastructure.
