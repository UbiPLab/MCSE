AB Dynamic Cloud Radio Access Networks (C-RAN) is an emerging wireless architecture that splits radio functions in a hierarchical cloud-based infrastructure. In Dynamic C-RAN, wireless functionalities can be divided into smaller components and distributed along with a hierarchical cloud infrastructure. Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) concepts have been recently investigated to facilitate management-related operations of these wireless functionalities. Despite the advances in providing flexible NFV orchestration for Virtualized Network Functions (VNF)s, there is still a lack of solutions aware of VNFs internal composition, a key characteristic of split virtualized radio functions. In this article, we advance NFV orchestration in a Dynamic C-RAN scenario presenting Orchestra, a split-aware NFVO for Dynamic C-RAN with support to customizable orchestration algorithms for different radio function splits. Orchestra is validated through instantiates and migrates VNFCs following the decisions of personalized orchestration algorithms, with a petty impact in the VNFC's deployment and migration time.
