AB Virtualization and cloud computing can help an organization achieve significant datacenter savings in hardware costs, operational expenditures, and energy demands while achieving improvements in quality of service and business agility. The combination of a hardware based root of trust such as trust platform module (TPM) on virtual machine (VM) based system have being widely adopted. In this paper, combined with the trusted computing and cloud computing security, we establish a trust system with a certificate authority (CA) and trusted platform module (TPM). It takes the CA as the root of trust cloud computing platform. The servers use the TPM through the operations of acquisition, registration, certification for the certification and the operations of new construction, launch, running, transfer and maintenance for the virtual machine (VM). To implement the trusted ensure of the security, it designs the trusted module which take the TPM as the core, and develops the VM as a complete trust system with a measurement algorithm. It can be used into the VM authentication mechanism and the access user authentication mechanism of the VM.
