ID AUTHENTICATION SCHEME; EFFICIENT
AB Many hospitals and medical clinics have been using a wearable sensor in its health care system because the wearable sensor, which is able to measure the patients' biometric information, has been developed to analyze their patients remotely. The measured information is saved to a server in a medical center, and the server keeps the medical information, which also involves personal information, on a cloud system. The server and network devices are used by connecting each other, and sensitive medical records are dealt with remotely. However, these days, the attackers, who try to attack the server or the network systems, are increasing. In addition, the server and the network system have a weak protection and security policy against the attackers. In this paper, it is suggested that security compliance of medical contents should be followed to improve the level of security. As a result, the medical contents are kept safely.
