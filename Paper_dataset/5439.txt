AB Distributed computing, such as Cloud, provides traditional workflow applications with completely new deployment architecture offering high performance and scalability. However, when executing the workflow tasks in a distributed computing environment, significant scheduling overheads are generated. Task clustering is a key technology to optimize process execution. Unreasonable task clustering can lead to the problems of runtime and dependency imbalance, which reduces the degree of parallelism during task execution. In order to solve the problem of runtime imbalance, we propose Runtime Balance Clustering Algorithm (RBCA), which employs the Backtracking approach to make the runtime of each cluster more balanced. In addition, to address the problem of dependency imbalance, we also propose Dependency Balance Clustering Algorithm (DBCA), which defines the dependency correlation to measure the similarity between tasks in terms of data dependencies. The tasks with high dependency correlation are clustered together so as to avoid the dependency imbalance to most extent. We conducted extensive experiments on the WorkflowSim platform and compared our algorithms with the existing task clustering algorithms. The results show that RBCA and DBCA significantly reduce the execution time of the whole workflow. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
