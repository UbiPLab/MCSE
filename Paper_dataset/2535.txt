AB We present synthetic radio images of the GRB 170817A afterglow, computed from moving-mesh hydrodynamic simulations of binary neutron star merger outflows. Having expanded for nearly a year, the merger remnant is expected to subtend similar to 5 mas on the sky, potentially resolvable by very long baseline radio imaging techniques. Any observations revealing the radio centroid to be offset from the line of sight to the merger would be the smoking gun of a jetted outflow. However, our results indicate that a measurement of the centroid position alone cannot independently determine whether that jet escaped successfully from the merger debris cloud, or was "choked," yielding a quasi-spherical explosion. We find that in both scenarios, the centroid exhibits superluminal proper motion away from the merger site at roughly 4-10 mu as per day for at least the first 300 days. We argue that a successful strategy for differentiating among the explosion models will need to include multiple observations over the coming months to years. In particular, we find the time at which the centroid attains its maximum offset, and begins heading back toward the merger site, is considerably later if the jet was choked. Detecting a reversal of the centroid trajectory earlier than 600 days would uniquely identify a successful jet. Our results indicate that the source might be resolved using very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) radio observing techniques with similar to 1 mas resolution starting at roughly 400 days post-merger, and that the the angular extent of a successful jet is significantly smaller than that of a choked jet (4.5 versus 7 mas respectively).
