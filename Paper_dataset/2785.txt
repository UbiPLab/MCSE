AB Cloud computing is a trend of technology aimed at providing on-demand services with payment based on usage. In order to improve the use of resources, cloud providers adopt multi-tenant approaches, reducing the operation cost of services. Moreover, tenants have irregular workload patterns, which impacts in guarantees of quality of service, mainly due to interference among tenants. This paper proposes PredRep, a predictive approach to characterize the cloud database system workload and automatically provide or reduce resources by replication techniques. In order to evaluate PredRep, some experiments that measure the quality of service and elasticity are presented. Our experiment results confirm that PredRep reduces cost and SLA violations.
