AB Exterior ballistics performance evaluation plays a critical role in the design and development of the electromagnetic railgun system. The ballistics performance evaluation can be regarded as a multicriteria decision-making problem, for the reason that various characteristics, also termed criteria, have effects on the overall performance. A sophisticated simulation model, including six-DOF mechanics, railgun configuration, environment, and aerodynamics models are established to compute the exterior ballistics profile. Then a comprehensive framework based on cloud model and analytic hierarchy process method are proposed to evaluate ballistics performance. Eight criteria including ballistics velocity, energy efficiency, flight time, flight range, overload, attack angle, and sideslip angle stability are selected to determine exterior ballistics performance. The proposed approach yields the certainty degree of each criterion and integrates multicriteria into the whole performance. Two scenarios including 32-MJ launch energy and 200-km strike range are taken to generate alternatives for assessing ballistics performance, which demonstrate the proposed approach is feasible. Results show that in the same launch energy 32 MJ, the performance levels of 12-and 16-kg projectiles are I (excellent) and III (medium), respectively. Besides, gaining the projectile's mass can improve performance in the same strike range 200 km.
