AB The assiduous parade of the state-of-the-art sprouting digital technologies, is disrupting the smooth, easy-going health care digital ecosystem and forewarns us to manage it preemptively; since adaptation and survival of the fittest is a proven fact and we need to acclimatize to the mutated health care digital landscape. In this paper, the heightened consternations in the cloud are discoursed, with prime focus on integrity and privacy solutions, useful to hook the doles of cloud computing technologies for the health care world. An all-embracing appraisal of the correlated up-to-date research work on Provable Data Possession (PDP), tosses light on the erstwhile current status, research challenges, and future directions of PDP based health care data integrity. The need of the hour is a system, which, aids as an external auditor to audit the user's outsourced health care data in the cloud, deprived of the wisdom of the health care data content. The contributions in this paper are (1) A comprehensive analysis of the contemporary Privacy Conserving PDP data integrity schemes, (2) a proposed novel generic support framework, which is useful to shield stored health care data, provide authentication in the cloud environment, which, is scalable and efficient, (3) deployment of the Secure Privacy Conserving Provable Data Possession (SPC-PDP) framework. The results validate that the proposed SPC-PDP framework can competently accomplish secure auditing and outclass the erstwhile ones. The SPC-PDP framework is no doubt, a promising solution to the challenges soaring due to the state-of-the-art improvements in health care digital technology. Last but not the least, this paper also gives a bird's eye view on the future directions of secure and privacy preserving data integrity.
