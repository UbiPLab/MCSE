AB Distributed data sharing in Internet, social, and cloud computing paradigms incurs nonuniform costs such as consumed downstream bandwidth, downloading delays, and cloud-data-out monetary charges. To alleviate such costs, caches have been widely deployed and researched to find efficient online-cache-eviction algorithms. However, existing online algorithms have no offline foundation, thus they are far from a global optimum. This paper proposes a framework for developing an online cache eviction algorithm, which is grounded in a near-optimally and tractably offline algorithm namely Shortest Maximum Forward Distance (SMFD). On the formulation of the framework, the near-optimality and tractability properties of existing offline algorithms were evaluated through the formal evaluation of the optimality and computational tractability based upon variable object costs. Subsequently, the lowest-complexity suboptimal schemes were empirically investigated to seek a near-optimal offline one, which appears to be SMFD. Also, the results originally show that SMFD and its variant can practically achieve multiple conventionally upper bounds of limitless cache sizes in a stable and simultaneous manner. SMFD was then transformed into novel online SMFD by quantifying the offline property, maximum forward distance, of SMFD with cache-scope time-to-live approximation. To guarantee the effectiveness of online SMFD over evolving request streams, a safety bound guideline and a cache-scope time-to-live distribution model are also proposed. Finally, experience on the framework was gained via experiments based on deep-neural-network models.
