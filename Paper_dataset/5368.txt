AB Cloud Computing, a type of interpersonal computing offers services on demand. There arise numerous vulnerabilities and threats that jeopardize the authentication of the cloud services. Security services remain prevalent despite of standard policies offered by service providers, especially on public cloud. An encryption service is one of the conventional way to protect the plain data, by converting it into inarticulate form. This paper brings an interesting application service that provides security as a service to the users. This innovative service works based on a symmetric key encryption scheme. Encryption keys in the cryptographic process reveal the quality of encryption. Multiple keys are involved in this proposed encryption process, among them, one interesting key generation is from hybridization of improved cipher block chaining encryption operation and another from nature inspired genetic algorithm. Motivation for designing this hybrid algorithm is to minimize the execution time and storage space capacity. The experimental analysis is performed for multimedia files, including plain text, images. Performance of the proposed encryption algorithm is analyzed using various metrics that reveals the quality and strength of the algorithm in spite of various attacks. Evaluation reports state that this application service relics potential for authenticating multimedia files with better satisfaction while out-sourced as application in cloud computing environment.
