AB Cyber-physical-social systems (CPSSs) represent an emerging paradigm encompassing the cyber world, physical world and social world. One of the main purposes of CPSSs is to provide high-quality, proactive, and personalized services for humans. For CPSSs to realize this purpose, a novel services framework is needed. In this article, we present a tensor-based cloud-edge computing framework that mainly includes the cloud and edge planes. The cloud plane is used to process large-scale, long-term, global data, which can be used to obtain decision making information such as the feature, law, or rule sets. The edge plane is used to process small-scale, short-term, local data, which is used to present the real-time situation. Also, personalized services will be directly provided for humans by the edge plane according to the obtained feature, law, or rule sets and the local high-quality data obtained in the edge plane. Then a tensor-based services model is proposed to match the requirement of users in the local CPSS. Finally, a case study about CPSS services is proposed to demonstrate the application features of the proposed framework.
