AB Introduction- In this article proposes the creation of a prototype of storage of data on Cloud Computing using free software tools, for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which will contribute in improving the storage capacity of information, incorporating to the process a Cloud Storage tool, which allows to create, save and update the data in a synchronized way from any geographic location, reducing the risks of maintaining several versions of a document and losing temporary or definitive information. In this way it is proposed to show that free open source tools are low cost and collaborative for small businesses.
   Objective- Evaluate the relevance, feasibility and impact of Cloud Storage tools on free software in order to implement a data storage prototype to be used by small and medium enterprises, establishing organizational and decision-making schemes according to their objectives business.
   Methodology- It is based on a spiral method by stages. In the first stage the model of comparison of free software products Qualification and Selection of Opensource Software (QSOS) applied to identify the best Cloud Storage tool. Second stage, the design and implementation of the prototype was carried out for storage over Cloud Computing. The last stage, tests and adjustments were made in the validation of said prototype for its start-up.
   Results- Structure of a finished functional prototype for the storage of data on Cloud Computing through the use of free software tools, aimed at small and medium enterprises, evidencing its easy handling, control and decision making in the management of their data and deployment in the organization becoming a tool that benefits this type of productive sector.
   Conclusions- The construction of data storage systems on Cloud Computing, based or guided on the achieved prototype, constitutes a low cost tool in its implementation and maintenance, which contributes to the sustainability of the solution together with the possibility of scaling new functions and / or modules, by small and medium-sized companies, that do not have financial resources for investment in information technology and connectivity and storage services.
