AB Cryptography as we know it, is among the most discussed topics in the security world. Any transaction, financial or social, any data, corporate or private is not secure in an environment such as the cloud, where everything is connected to everything. The only way to save anything or to make a transaction securely is to make it meaningless to the rest of the world. It can be made meaningless when converted to some other form and this some other form can only be obtained through encryption. In this paper we discuss various techniques of homomorphic encryption applied on cloud computing and the need of security over the cloud by citing relevant statistics. We then propose and implement a secure E-voting system using the paillier encryption scheme. The main goal of this research is to design a secure voting system using the internet platform to communicate between the voting system and voters.
