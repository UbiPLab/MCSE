AB With the spread of democracy around the world, voting is considered a way to collectively make decisions. Recently, many government offices and private organizations use voting to make decisions when the opinions of multiple decision makers must be accounted for. Another advancement: cloud computing attracts many individual and organizations due to low cost, scal-ability, and the ability to leverage big data. These considerations motivate our proposal of the TokenVote scheme. TokenVote is an electronic voting system in the cloud that uses revocable fingerprint biotokens with a secret sharing scheme to provide privacy, non-repudiation, and authentication. The TokenVote scheme spreads shares of secret (vote), embeds them inside the encoding biometric data (i.e. fingerprint), and distributes them over multiple clouds. During the voting process, each voter must provide his/her fingerprint, causing the TokenVote scheme to collect all voting shares from all voters to compute the final voting result. TokenVote does cloud parallel computing for the voting process in an encoded mode to prevent disclosure of the shares of voting and the fingerprint itself. Our experiments show that TokenSign has a significant performance and comparable accuracy when compared with two baselines.
