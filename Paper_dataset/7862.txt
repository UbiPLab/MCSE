AB This paper presents a novel multi objective model for optimizing the purchase decision of a cloud computing services customer. The providers are typically offering consumers cloud computing varying information systems services. The cloud services consist of different functionalities at varying costs, and varying reliability. So the customer's main objectives (based on the literature) are to maximize their utility, and minimize their costs and risks. Since utility cost and risks are different dimensions, the problem is essentially a multi-objective optimization problem. So far, previous research does not address the multi objective nature of the problem. This article deals with optimizing consumers' decision, but at the same time maintaining each of their objectives' considerations. An optimization model presented and illustrated. The article also demonstrates the advantages gained by the optimization model when implemented using the dynamic cloud architecture over the traditional cloud architecture.
