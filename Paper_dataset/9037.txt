AB Multi-tenancy is one of the key features of cloud computing, which provides scalability and economic benefits to the end-users and service providers by sharing the same cloud platform and its underlying infrastructure with the isolation of shared network and compute resources. However, resource management in the context of multi-tenant cloud computing is becoming one of the most complex task due to the inherent heterogeneity and resource isolation. This paper proposes a novel cloud-based workflow scheduling (CWSA) policy for compute-intensive workflow applications in multi-tenant cloud computing environments, which helps minimize the overall workflow completion time, tardiness, cost of execution of the workflows, and utilize idle resources of cloud effectively. The proposed algorithm is compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, i.e., First Come First Served (FCFS), EASY Backfilling, and Minimum Completion Time (MCT) scheduling policies to evaluate the performance. Further, a proof-of-concept experiment of real-world scientific workflow applications is performed to demonstrate the scalability of the CWSA, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed solution. The simulation results show that the proposed scheduling policy improves the workflow performance and outperforms the aforementioned alternative scheduling policies under typical deployment scenarios.
