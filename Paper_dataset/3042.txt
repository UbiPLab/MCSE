AB Digital manufacturing aims to create highly customizable products with higher quality and lower costs by integrating Industrial Internet of Things, big data analytics, cloud computing, and advanced robots into manufacturing plants. As manufacturing machines are increasingly retrofitted with sensors as well as connected via wireless networks or wired Ethernet, digital manufacturing systems are becoming more accessible than ever. While advancement in sensing, artificial intelligence, and wireless technologies enables a paradigm shift in manufacturing, cyber-attacks pose significant threats to the manufacturing sector. This paper presents a review of cybersecurity in digital manufacturing systems from system characterization, threat and vulnerability identification, control, and risk determination aspects as well as identifies challenges and future work.
