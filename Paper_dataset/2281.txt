AB We present (CO)-C-12, (CO)-C-13, and (CO)-O-18 data as the next major release for the CHaMP project, an unbiased sample of Galactic molecular clouds in 1 = 280 degrees-300 degrees. From a radiative transfer analysis, we self-consistently compute 3D cubes of optical depth, excitation temperature, and column density for similar to 300 massive clumps, and update the I-12CO-dependent CO -> H-2 conversion law of Barnes et al. For N proportional to I-P, we find p = 1.92 +/- 0.05 for the velocity-resolved conversion law aggregated over all clumps. A practical, integrated conversion law is N-12CO = (4.0 +/- 0.3) x 10(19)m(-2) I-12CO (1.27 +/- 0.02), confirming an overall 2x higher total molecular mass for Milky Way clouds, compared to the standard X factor. We use these laws to compare the kinematics of clump interiors with their foreground (CO)-C-12 envelopes, and find evidence that most clumps are not dynamically uniform: irregular portions seem to be either slowly accreting onto the interiors, or dispersing from them. We compute the spatially resolved mass accretion/dispersal rate across all clumps, and map the local flow timescale. While these flows are not clearly correlated with clump structures, the inferred accretion rate is a statistically strong function of the local mass surface density Sigma, suggesting near-exponential growth or loss of mass over effective timescales similar to 30-50 Myr. At high enough Sigma, accretion dominates , suggesting gravity plays an important role in both processes. If confirmed by numerical simulations, this sedimentation picture would support arguments for long clump lifetimes mediated by pressure confinement, with a terminal crescendo of star formation, suggesting a resolution to the 40 year old puzzle of the dynamical state of molecular clouds and their low star formation efficiency.
