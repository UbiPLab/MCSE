DE Cloud Computing; Scheduling; Cuckoo Search (CS)
AB Cloud Computing is an emerging technique. Certain parallel applications show a reduction in utilization of CPU resources when there is a rise in parallelism if jobs are not schedules correctly then it decreases the computer performance. Task scheduling is a valuable tool which influences performance of cloud service providers to a great extent. Conventional approach that is used in optimizations is deterministic, fast, and gives perfect answers but frequently bog down in local optimum. In this paper, Cuckoo Search (CS) is proposed for the optimization. Experiments conducted and the results revealed that the proposed method outperformed other methods.
