AB Connected vehicular cloud computing (CVCC) is a promising paradigm that utilizes the rich resources of connected cars. However, it also introduces new cyber-attack surfaces that may compromise the security or privacy of the vehicles. In reality, security in vehicular cloud computing lies in the willingness of vehicle owners who are concerned with their vehicles' protection from various threats. Increasing the participation of vehicles will improve the security in vehicular cloud computing as a whole. Therefore, for a CVCC service provider, it is very critical to encourage vehicle owners to invest in their own security for achieving deeper security of CVCC systems. In this article, we first present a CVCC architecture and its applications. Then we study several security issues in vehicular cloud computing. Afterward, we model a CVCC network by a two-phase heterogeneous public good game, and then investigate the influence of different incentive mechanisms and the structure of a complex network describing the vehicles' connectivity on the vehicles' investment rate. Finally, we present our conclusion.
