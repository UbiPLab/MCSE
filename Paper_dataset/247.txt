AB Due to the growth of users and linked devices in networks, there is an emerging need for dynamic solutions to control and manage computing and network resources. This document proposes a Distributed Wireless Operative System on a Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) to manage and control computing resources in relation to several virtual resources linked in a wireless network. This prototype has two elements: a local agent that works on each physical node to manage the computing resources (e.g., virtual resources and distributed applications) and an orchestrator agent that monitors, manages, and deploys policies on each physical node. These elements arrange the local and global computing resources to provide a quality service to the users of the Ad-hoc cluster. The proposed S.O.V.O.R.A. model (Operating Virtualized System oriented to Ad-hoc networks) defines primitives, commands, virtual structures, and modules to operate as a distributed wireless operating system.
