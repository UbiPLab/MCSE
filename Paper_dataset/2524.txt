AB The world is moving into a new era, Internet of Things (loT) that means everything surrounding us will have their corresponding virtual image in the cloud and they will communicate with each other. In this research, a component based unified architecture for utility service in the cloud has been proposed for deploying service and use of the application in an optimum way to make the maximum availability of service within the limited duration of time and minimum configuration overhead. Our proposed architecture is divided into several layers and each layer is designed based on several components. Experimentally we observe through IBM Bluemix [28] proposed utility service system along with its working procedure and corresponding performance evaluation, which is promising. Therefore, we found proposed architecture is also capable to protect utility service and corresponding resources from external threats. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
