AB Massive simulations and arrays of sensing devices, in combination with increasing computing resources, have generated large, complex, high-dimensional datasets used to study phenomena across numerous fields of study. Visualization plays an important role in exploring such datasets. We provide a comprehensive survey of advances in high-dimensional data visualization that focuses on the past decade. We aim at providing guidance for data practitioners to navigate through a modular view of the recent advances, inspiring the creation of new visualizations along the enriched visualization pipeline, and identifying future opportunities for visualization research.
