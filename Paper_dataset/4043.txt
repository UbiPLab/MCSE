AB For the problems of low delay, low power requirement and access congestion caused by computational unloading of mass devices, a Joint Offloading Decision and Resource Allocation Algorithm (JODRAA) is proposed based on cloud-fog hybrid network architecture. Firstly, the algorithm considers the combination of cloud and fog computing, and establishes a resource optimization model to minimize system energy consumption and resource cost with maximum delay as constraint. Secondly, the original problem is transformed into a standard Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program (QCQP) problem, and a low-complexity joint unloading decision-making and computational resource allocation algorithm is designed. Furthermore, considering the access congestion problem caused by massive computing of unloading devices, an estimation model of the overflow probability of unloading user access request queue is established, and an online measurement based time-frequency resource allocation algorithm for fog nodes is proposed. Finally, the iterative bandwidth and power allocation strategy is obtained by using fractional programming theory and Lagrange dual decomposition method. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can minimize the system energy consumption and resource cost on the premise of time delay.
