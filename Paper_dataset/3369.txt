AB Searchable encryption scheme-based ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is a effective scheme for providing multiuser to search over the encrypted data on cloud storage environment. However, most of the existing search schemes lack the privacy protection of the data owner and have higher computation time cost. In this paper, we propose a multiuser access control searchable privacy-preserving scheme in cloud storage. First, the data owner only encrypts the data file and sets the access control list of multiuser and multiattribute for search data file. And the computing operation, which generates the attribute keys of the users' access control and the keyword index, is given trusted third party to perform for reducing the computation time of the data owner. Second, using CP-ABE scheme, trusted third party embeds the users' access control attributes into their attribute keys. Only when those embedded attributes satisfy the access control list, the ciphertext can be decrypted accordingly. Finally, when the user searches data file, the keyword trap door is no longer generated by the user, and it is handed to the proxy server to finish. Also, the ciphertext is predecrypted by the proxy sever before the user performs decryption. In this way, the flaw of the client's limited computation resource can be solved. Security analysis results show that this scheme has the data privacy, the privacy of the search process, and the collusion-resistance attack, and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the computation time of the data owner and the users.
