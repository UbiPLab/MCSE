AB Availability is one of the most important requirements in production system. Keeping a persistent level of high availability in the Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud computing is a challenge due to the complexity of service providing. By definition, the availability can be maintained by coupling with the fault tolerance approaches. Recently, many fault tolerance methods have been developed, but few of them adequately consider the fault detection aspect, which is critical to issue the appropriate recovery actions just in time. In this paper, based on a rigorous analysis on the nature of failures, we would like to introduce a method to early identify the faults occurring in the IaaS system. By engaging fuzzy logic algorithm and prediction technique, the proposed approach can provide better performance in terms of accuracy and reaction rate, which subsequently enhances the system reliability.
