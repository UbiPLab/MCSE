AB A new model of heavy parallel computing, distributed systems development aims at creating an abstract cloud computer using the free resources on WANs for uncertain contexts such as the Internet. As in distributed systems, there is a dynamic communication platform and resources, resource management including load balancing is an important issue. The purpose of load balancing is to find an efficient mapping of things on the processors in the system so that each processor carries out an almost equal amount of works to minimize the run time and its total cost. This paper presents a novel method to schedule and prioritize tasks in a distributed computing environment using the ant milk optimization algorithm which can cause a good balance between various factors. The simulation results indicated a good quality of the proposed method compared to other methods.
