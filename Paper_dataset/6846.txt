AB Conjunctive keyword search encryption is an important technique for protecting sensitive personal health records that are outsourced to cloud servers. It has been extensively employed for cloud storage, which is a convenient storage option that saves bandwidth and economizes computing resources. However, the process of searching outsourced data may facilitate the leakage of sensitive personal information. Thus, an efficient data search approach with high security is critical. The multi-user search function is critical for personal health records (PHRs). To solve these problems, this paper proposes a novel multi-user conjunctive keyword search scheme (mNCKS) without a secure channel against keyword guessing attacks for personal health records, which is referred to as a secure channel-free mNCKS (SCF-mNCKS). The security of this scheme is demonstrated using the Decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) and Decision Linear (D-Linear) assumptions in the standard model. Comparisons are performed to demonstrate the security advantages of the SCF-mNCKS scheme and show that it has more functions than other schemes in the case of analogous efficiency.
