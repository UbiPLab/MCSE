   Eavesdropping/DoS attacks
AB The cloud-computing paradigm has been driving the cloud-leveraged refactoring of existing information and communications technology services, including voice over IP (VoIP). In this paper, we design a prototype secure mobile VoIP (mVoIP) service with the open-source Asterisk private branch exchange (PBX) software, using Docker lightweight virtualization for mobile devices with the immutable concept of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). In addition, the secure mVoIP service provides protection against eavesdropping and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, using secure voice coding and real-time migration. We also experimentally verify the quality of the secure voice and the associated communication delay over a distributed global connectivity environment to protect against eavesdropping and real-time migration to mitigate DoS attacks.
