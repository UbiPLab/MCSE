AB Wireless sensor network consists of independent sensor nodes which are distributed in an environment and sense information from its surrounding. The limitations of wireless sensor network are storage capacity, processing capability, resource constraint, energy, etc. Integrating mobile cloud computing with wireless sensor network introduces sensor mobile cloud which provides solution to storage limitation by offloading the sensed data through mobile devices. To send data from the sink node to the cloud, sensor nodes must be deployed in a manner so that it can reduce energy consumption. Data aggregation is one of the most important methods to decrease the total energy consumption of the network. Energy consumption of the sink node can be reduced by deploying a resource privileged mobile device as a relay node to transmit the collected data to the cloud. For data aggregation, different tree structures are used. In this paper we have used 2-tree, spanning tree, and complete ternary tree structures for the placement of sensor nodes to form a network. These three network structures are compared and analysed using Qualnet 7.1 based on the different simulation parameters: energy consumption in different modes, residual battery capacity, average jitter, average delay, average path loss, average transmission delay and signals received with errors. In simulation it has been noticed that ternary tree out performs compared to the other trees with respect to energy consumption as well as other parameters that are considered.
