AB Cloud service providers (CSPs) adapt different pricing models for their offered services. Some of the models are suitable for short term requirement while others may be suitable for the cloud service user's (CSU) long term requirement. For example, reservation-based pricing model is appropriate for a CSU's long term demand for resources. Finding the optimal amount of resources to be reserved in advance, to minimize the total cost, needs sufficient research effort. Various algorithms were discussed in the last couple of years to solve the resource reservation problem but most of them are based on integer programming problem (IPP) which is NP in nature. In this paper, we derive some heuristic-based polynomial time algorithms to find some near optimal solution to this problem. We show that the cost for CSU using our approach is comparable to the solution obtained using optimal IPP.
