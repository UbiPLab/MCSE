AB Cloud computing is a potentially tremendous platform and its presence is experienced in day to day life. Most infrastructure and technology enterprises have migrated to a cloud-based infrastructure and storage. With so much dependence on the cloud as a distributed and reliable platform, but a few issues remain as a challenge and provide food for the ever-active research entity. Considering a very basic aspect of VM migration followed by VM placement, one VM at a time is a prominent approach. This article presents a novel idea of placing two VMs at a time. This proposal is a draft of solution for the Two VM Placement problem. The experimental validation was done against a well-known placement algorithm, the power aware best fit decreasing (PABFD). PABFD and TVMP were applied on a given context and results were obtained for three important parameters, which include the number of VM migrations, reallocation means, and energy efficiency. Improvements on these parameters may prove beneficial.
