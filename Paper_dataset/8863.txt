AB Based on the idea of the encryption algorithm, a new method for data storage in cloud computing is designed. First of all, gives the cloud data security framework in 9 steps; secondly, the data encryption and data decryption algorithm is designed by combining the multiplication, addition, update algorithm and the specific operation; thirdly, combining the index and scanning technology and according to the reverse order strategy design a data retrieval algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method in data encryption, data decryption, data retrieval and other aspects of the implementation of the efficiency is significantly higher than the BGV algorithm, and more suitable for the safe storage of cloud data.
