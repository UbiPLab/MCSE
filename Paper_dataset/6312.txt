AB Load management of resources during high load demand managed by load management mechanism. An efficacious resource management algorithm effectively manages the load imbalance. Virtual Machine (VM) migration policy can maximize the throughput of the Cloud. Overloaded User Base (UB) high resource request increases the waiting time of the task and decreases the throughput. Task migration from high loaded VM to low loaded VM help to decrease the queue size and increase the throughput of the system. Effective resource management mechanism improves the performance and reduces the service level agreement (SLA) violations. Although researchers did the lot of work to manage load imbalance, but still need improvement. In this paper, proposed Dynamic weighted Live Migration (DWLM) Load balancing algorithm to manage the load imbalance problem. The proposed experiment result compares with another two algorithms. DWLM gives the better experiment results in Throughput, Migration time, Scalability and Fault Tolerance matrices.
