AB This article comes up with a novel particulate matter (PM) monitoring scheme, denoted by uRET, that conducts microscale sensing resolution in urban environments. uRET relies on battery-powered fine PM sensors with the Bluetooth low energy module and smart mobile devices of pedestrians who walk around urban places. In such opportunistic sensing data acquisition by mobile relaying, it is highly challenging to accomplish the sufficient quality of PM event observation. So, uRET is designed for reliable event transport from sensors to a cloud server. A proof of concept prototype is implemented for field tests by APIs of common map platforms. Test results show that uRET can support high enough delivery success ratio against movement velocity and existence situation of mobiles to achieve required detection quality at microscale urban places.
