AB The increasing availability of data, due to the adoption of low-cost industrial internet of things technologies, coupled with increasing processing power from cloud computing, is fuelling increase use of data-driven models in manufacturing. Utilising case studies from the food and drink industry and waste management industry, the considerations and challenges faced when developing data-driven models for manufacturing systems are explored. Ensuring a high-quality set of model development data that accurately represents the manufacturing system is key to the successful development of a data-driven model. The cross-industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM) framework is used to provide a reference at to what stage process manufacturers will face unique considerations and challenges when developing a data-driven model. This paper then explores how data-driven models can be utilised to characterise process streams and support the implementation of the circular economy principals, process resilience and waste valorisation.
