AB Diverse researches following the advancement of IT technology and emergence of smart devices are common in current research. In particular, the most commercialized smart device, the smart phone, provides convenient communication among users due to easy portability and real-time information sharing within a diverse system. Moreover, spatial and temporal use of smart devices greatly increased because these devices are capable of performing the same functions as a desktop personal computer, making smart phones extremely popular. However, research on smart phones has mainly focused on the convenience of the services offered on these devices, while the issue of security has been neglected. Smart phones are vulnerable to diverse, malicious attacks, which have increased as new functions are developed and commonly used. For this reason, a number of applications were developed to detect a variety of malicious codes in smart phones and prevent private information leakage. However, due to the difficulties of recognizing and responding to attacks, such as advanced persistent threats (APTs), an intelligent security model is urgently required. This paper suggests intelligent security model of smart phone based on human behavior in mobile cloud computing to detect diverse types of malicious code in smart phones and respond to advanced attacks, such as APTs. The suggested intelligent security model of smart phone securely protects users from private information leaks and illegal billing action. Moreover, intelligent response to malicious, difficult-to-detect code is provided by a user behavior-based intelligent analysis, which makes it possible to shut down network, registry, drive, and system accessibility and to notify users to respond to malicious attacks.
