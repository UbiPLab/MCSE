AB Cloud computing provides excellent quality computing services with lower cost and better performance. The cloud services which are provided by the trusted third party encourage the customers and organizations to move their activities to the cloud. While moving towards the concept of on-demand service, resource pooling and shifting everything on the distributive environment, security is the major obstacle for this new dreamed vision of computing capability. Over the past several years, many security mechanisms have been proposed for protecting outsourced data. In this paper, we present a consolidated survey of various security issues and threats pertaining to data in cloud computing. Further, we analyzed security challenges in cloud based on its delivery models. We also discussed the component based classification of major security concerns and recent counter measures that present in the literature with the intention of providing an in-detail understanding of cloud computing security needs. In addition, a brief outlook of security precautions adopted by cloud service providers and various Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems is presented.
