AB Cloud-Based Outsource Software Development (COSD) is a new methodology adopted by organizations to develop software using teams of knowledge workers located across the globe using cloud computing services. However, there is a lack of understanding of challenges associated with successful execution of COSD projects. The objective of this study is to identify and prioritize the challenges that influence COSD projects. First, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and identified 21 challenges that impact COSD projects. Next, a questionnaire survey was developed based on the SLR findings to collect feedback from industry practitioners. Finally, we applied the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) to rank the identified challenges for COSD projects. We also present a prioritization-based taxonomy of the identified challenges which will help practitioners to focus on the critical areas for successful implementation of COSD projects.
