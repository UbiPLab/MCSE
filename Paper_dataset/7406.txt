AB Nowadays, mobile devices are becoming the most popular computing device as their computing capabilities increase rapidly. However, it is still challenging to execute highly sophisticated applications such as 3D video games on mobile devices due to its constrained key computational resources. Execution offloading approaches have been proposed to resolve this problem by strengthening mobile devices with powerful cloud. Unfortunately, the existing offloading approaches are not suitable for 3D video games because of the unique execution characteristics of them. In this paper, we propose a streaming-based execution offloading framework to enable execution offloading for 3D video games. The experiments show that our framework successfully guarantees 20 frames per second for our benchmark.
