AB The deployment of a data-intensive application to a Cloud poses a number of serious challenges, mainly concerning the provider and resources selection process, based on the Quality of Service expected, as well as the management of the Virtual Machines in the provider premises. This work attempts to address those issues by providing a sophisticated toolkit assisting both the Cloud adopter and the Cloud Provider, in terms of application profiling and categorization, analyzing and predicting interference effects, bench-marking and exploiting Quality of Experience in Cloud computing infrastructures. Thus, a service oriented computing architecture is presented, realizing this toolkit in the context of the CloudPerfect framework, and a set of experiments is carried out, evaluating those tools in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Finally, a specific Use Case scenario is analyzed, that involves an Infrastructure as a Service adoption for an EPR/CRM System. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
