AB Coastal remote sensing images have huge data which has features of the volume, variety, complexity and specialisation. The problem is how to effectively carry out data integration, fast extract and data mining of knowledge and information from these massive remote sensing data as it is far behind the requirements of coastal professional applications. In this paper, based on data mining, remote sensing theory, space information and cloud computing technology towards the goal of coastal zone remote sensing data integration and data mining service system, the meta-data model, data storage model, data mining framework, web service framework model, etc. are provided and designed. Finally, a prototype system of remote sensing data mining services in the cloud computing environment is designed and developed using system integration, and is demonstrated and verified by professional applications. It is valuable to serve the development of the coastal zone, monitoring, planning and integrated management and other fields.
