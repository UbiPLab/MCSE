AB In this work, we study how to minimize the average system delay in a cloud computing center with heterogeneous servers, where each server may have a different average service rate. We consider M/M-i/C/K with a single server threshold and double congestion thresholds. The analytical models and performance measures are derived for the systems considered. The effect of the average arrival rate on performance measures is studied. It is shown that M/M-i/C/K with a single server threshold and double congestion thresholds outperforms M/M-i/C/K in terms of the average system delay. Finally, a computer simulation is written to verify the accuracy of the analytical results. (C) 2017 The Korean Institute of Communications and Information Sciences (KICS).
