AB Distributed storage systems using replication are well-known systems for storing big data. Replication technique provides reliability of the data but makes the system expensive. During the recent years, many research works have focused on the technique of regenerating codes which is a method that divides the file into parts and stores in several nodes. These codes can generate the whole file by contacting some of total existing nodes. In this paper, we have proposed an algorithm that maintains distributed files consistency by excluding simultaneous operation that create conflicts and manages requests delivered to different servers with the least communication with other servers. The requests are self-managed by each server and only in case of necessity communication occurs with other servers. Our algorithm provides high availability and scalability to the distributed storage system and keeps stored data free from errors.
