AB In Distributed Mobile Computing paradigm, mobile devices are offer unlimited services over mobile cloud computing. However, the limitation of the mobile devices and mobile cloud lead to several issues and challenges such as inadequate bandwidth, time delay, limited energy, poor quality of services and frequent disconnected network. To deal with these obstacles, we propose strategy dynamic task optimization in mobile cloud with offloading algorithm. In this paper the offloading algorithm we designed a model for coordinated management and optimized utilization of resource in mobile cloud for offloading process. The experimental evaluation are performed through the simulation results proves the feasibility and reliability, which shows its better mobile transactions with effective utilization of energy, resources, bandwidth, reducing the overhead time and improved quality of services for disconnected network between mobile devices and cloud servers.
