AB Energy-efficient Cloud Infrastructure Resource Allocation Framework is getting popularity as it is paying effective attention to cloud data management with a view to achieve maximize revenue and minimize cost. This infrastructure can encourage for both cloud providers and users for allocating cloud infrastructure resources for fulfilling not only good energy efficiency measured in Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) and data center Infrastructure Efficiency (DCiE) but also high CPU utilization. Therefore, in this paper we proposed a framework which can show effective performance for achieving the high data center energy efficiency and preventing Service Level Agreement (SLA) violation respectively with the aim of green cloud resources deployment. The framework accomplishes cloud infrastructure resource allocation on the basic of Reinforcement Learning mechanism and Fuzzy Logic for green solutions. The evaluation for Energy-efficient Resource Allocation is experimented on the traces of the PlanetLab virtualized environment for gaining good PUE and CPU utilization. (C) 2018 The Authors.
