AB Virtualization of servers and networks is a key technique to resolve the conflict between the increasing demands on computing power and the high cost of hardware in data centers. In order to map virtual networks to physical infrastructure efficiently, designers have to make careful decisions on the allocation of limited resources, which makes placement of virtual networks in data centers a critical issue. In this paper, we study the placement of virtual networks in fat-tree data center networks. In order to meet the requirements of instant parallel data transfer between multiple computing units, we propose a model of multicast-capable virtual networks (MVNs). We then design four virtual machine (VM) placement schemes to embed MVNs into fat-tree data center networks, named Most-Vacant-Fit (MVF), Most-Compact-First (MCF), Mixed-Bidirectional-Fill (MBF), and Malleable-Shallow-Fill (MSF). All these VM placement schemes guarantee the nonblocking multicast capability of each MVN while simultaneously achieving significant saving in the cost of network hardware. In addition, each VM placement scheme has its unique features. The MVF scheme has zero interference to existing computing tasks in data centers; the MCF scheme leads to the greatest cost saving; the MBF scheme simultaneously possesses the merits of MVF and MCF, and it provides an adjustable parameter allowing cloud providers to achieve preferred balance between the cost and the overhead; the MSF scheme performs at least as well as MBF, and possesses some additional predictable features. Finally, we compare the performance and overhead of these VM placement schemes, and present simulation results to validate the theoretical results.
