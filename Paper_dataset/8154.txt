AB Featured Application The proposed model and architecture can be used to build virtual prototyping laboratories, taking into account geographically distributed human, manufacturing, and measurement resources, which will be seen as one coherent cyber-human system. This will accelerate the time needed to develop a prototype and reduce the cost of its production. In this paper, the authors present a completely new approach to the remote prototyping process, taking into account the distributed nature of design and manufacturing resources. A new model is suggested, taking into account the conditions of the Industry 4.0 concept, along with a component of remote implementation and coordination of operations. On the basis of this model, the architecture of the target system is developed, which is further built and implemented in the actual productive environment. The system's functionality additionally enables the implementation of the design and production process in critical conditions resulting from natural disasters or epidemic states. The practical application of the developed solutions is presented on the design of a ventilator, which is dedicated to help in the fight against epidemic states, e.g., coronavirus.
