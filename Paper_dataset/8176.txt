AB Nowadays Telecom service providers are seeking new paradigms of service creation and execution platform to reduce new services' time to market and increase profitability. However, the existing static services orchestration approaches cannot meet the dynamic complicated business demands. This paper proposes a hybrid service orchestration platform for Internet-Telephony networks. Firstly, designs a hybrid service orchestration language for developers to achieve dynamic and rapid orchestration of new hybrid services over the Internet-Telephony networks. Secondly, proposes an event-driven and component-based hybrid service orchestration container to meet the asynchronous dynamic interactions between hybrid services. Thirdly, proposes a cost-aware auto-scaling approach, including the pre-scaling and real-time scaling stages, to dynamically scale the required resources at different levels. Finally, illustrates the hybrid voice chatting services orchestration scenario, and also the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed platform are validated through extensive experiments.
