AB Nowadays, service composition is one of the major problems in the Cloud due to the exceptional growth in the number of services deployed by providers. Recently, atomic services have been found to be unable to deal with all client requirements. Traditional service composition gives the clients a composite service without non-functional parameters. To respond to both functional and non-functional parameters, we need a service composition. Since web services cannot communicate with each other or participate dynamically to handle changes service parameters in service composition, this issue has led us to use a dynamic entity represented by an agent based on dynamic architecture. This work proposes an agent-based architecture with a new cooperation protocol that can offer an automatic and adaptable service composition by providing a composite service with the maximum quality of service. The implementation of this model has been provided in order to evaluate the authors' system. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed system.
