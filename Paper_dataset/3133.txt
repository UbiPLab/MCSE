AB Hyperscale datacenters (DCs), spread in various locations around the globe, provide computing and storage resources for cloud and other applications. Elastic optical networks (both landline and subsea) operated by a single or multiple entities are used to form the inter-DC network and serve the constantly increasing traffic. In addition, optical switching technologies are researched for intra-DC networks as a means to achieve higher capacity and energy efficiency. Joint optimization and orchestration of inter-DC and intra-DC network infrastructures is the key for realizing the network virtualization and network as service visions. We present a hierarchical software defined networking orchestration platform that treats intra-DC and inter-DC networks as domains and cooperates with domain specific orchestrators/controllers to achieve inter-domain, end-to-end orchestration. The systems developed are evaluated both in an emulated and in a realistic testbed, showcasing dynamic end-to-end path establishment functionality with dedicated capacity and low control overhead.
