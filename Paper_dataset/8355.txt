AB At present, the number of vehicle owners is increasing, and the cars with autonomous driving functions have attracted more and more attention. The lane detection combined with cloud computing can effectively solve the drawbacks of traditional lane detection relying on feature extraction and high definition, but it also faces the problem of excessive calculation. At the same time, cloud data processing combined with edge computing can effectively reduce the computing load of the central nodes. The traditional lane detection method is improved, and the current popular convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to build a dual model based on instance segmentation. In the image acquisition and processing processes, the distributed computing architecture provided by edge-cloud computing is used to improve data processing efficiency. The lane fitting process generates a variable matrix to achieve effective detection in the scenario of slope change, which improves the real-time performance of lane detection. The method proposed in this paper has achieved good recognition results for lanes in different scenarios, and the lane recognition efficiency is much better than other lane recognition models.
