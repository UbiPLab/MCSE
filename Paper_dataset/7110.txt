AB Internet of things (IoT) is a smart technology that connects anything anywhere at any time. Such ubiquitous nature of IoT is responsible for draining out energy from its resources. Therefore, the energy efficiency of IoT resources has emerged as a major research issue. In this paper, an energy-efficient architecture for IoT has been proposed, which consists of three layers, namely, sensing and control, information processing, and presentation. The architectural design allows the system to predict the sleep interval of sensors based upon their remaining battery level, their previous usage history, and quality of information required for a particular application. The predicted value can be used to boost the utilization of cloud resources by reprovisioning the allocated resources when the corresponding sensory nodes are in sleep mode. This mechanism allows the energy-efficient utilization of all the IoT resources. The experimental results show a significant amount of energy saving in the case of sensor nodes and improved resource utilization of cloud resources.
