AB By the widespread use of cloud storage service, users get a lot of conveniences such as low-price file remote storage and flexible file sharing. The research points in cloud computing include the verification of data integrity, the protection of data privacy and flexible data access. The integrity of data is ensured by a challenge-and-response protocol based on the signatures generated by group users. Many existing schemes use group signatures to make sure that the data stored in cloud is intact for the purpose of privacy and anonymity. However, group signatures do not consider user equality and the problem of frameability caused by group managers. Therefore, we propose a data sharing scheme PSFS to support user equality and traceability meanwhile based on our previous work HA-DGSP. PSFS has some secure properties such as correctness, traceability, homomorphic authentication and practical data sharing. The practical data sharing ensures that the data owner won't loss the control of the file data during the sharing and the data owner will get effective incentive of data sharing. The effective incentive is realized by the technology of blockchain. The experimental results show that the communication overhead and computational overhead of PSFS is acceptable.
