AB Cloud computing is on the horizon of the domain of information technology over the recent few years, giving different remotely accessible services to the cloud users. The quality-of-service (QoS) maintaining of a cloud service provider is the most dominating research issue today. The QoS embraces with different issues like virtual machine (VM) allocation, optimization of response time and throughput, utilizing processing capability, load balancing etc. VM allocation policy deals with the allocation of VMs to the hosts in different datacenters. This paper highlights a new VM allocation policy that distributes the load of VMs among hosts which improves the utilization of hosts' processing capability as well as makespan and throughput of cloud system. The experimental results are obtained by utilizing trace based simulation in CloudSim 3.0.3 and compared with existing VM allocation policies.
