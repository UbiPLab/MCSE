AB To store data securely in the Cloud Server is one of the key objectives of Cloud Computing. Always the Data Owners (DW) want the top level security from the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) to store their sensitive data as pay and use basis and enjoy the high quality service without hacking or misuse or unauthorized access of the data. This paper proposes new security architecture - Safety as a service (SFaaS) which helps to store data safely on the cloud server and enforce the access control on the data. The main concept is the Safety Service Provider (SSP) offers SFaaS, plays the vital role in secured data storage or access control on the data. So before storing any data on the cloud server or accessing the existing data, SSP registers the DW, the Authorized Users (AU) and the CSP to establish a secure logical communication channel between them. Here the DW or AU is not directly related to the CSP, rather than there is a direct mutual trust relation between the DW & the SSP, as well as the SSP & the CSP, i.e. without the SSP's concern the DW, AU or CSP no one is able to communicate each others.
