AB Cloud computing systems require massive storage infrastructures, which have significant implications on power bills, carbon emissions, and the logistics of data centers. Various proprietary "cold storage" services, based on spun-down disks or tapes, offer reduced tariffs but also lead to extended times to first access. One way to improve cold-storage systems is to build them on a file system that allows for the I/O patterns of storage devices. We have developed a cold-storage test-bed for mobile messenger services, which takes into account the power consumption of each hard disk in the system. We analyzed a trace of I/O requests from a messenger service and found that they had a strongly skewed Zipfian distribution and that most of the stored data is cold. Current cloud benchmarking tools cannot reproduce this pattern of I/O. Therefore, we have developed a tool for benchmarking cold-storage systems that emulates this type of long-tail distribution and can contribute to reducing the power consumption of mobile messenger services.
