AB Interpretation of SO2 line emission in warm environments requires a detailed knowledge of collisional rate coefficients for a wide range of levels and temperatures. Using an accurate theoretical interaction potential for SO2-H-2, rate coefficients for collisions of SO2 with para and ortho-H-2 for the 31 first SO2, rotational levels are calculated for temperatures up to 500 K using the coupled states (CS) approximation. From a comparison with previously published close-coupling (CC) results, it was shown that the two sets of data agree within 20-30 per cent for both para- and ortho-H-2 collisions. As previously found within the CC approach, the CS rate coefficients with ortho and para-H-2 differ by a factor of 2 in average, the largest being mainly the rates for collisions with ortho-H-2. For higher levels and temperatures, rate constants were computed within the infinite order sudden (IOS) approximation. Rate coefficients were obtained for the lowest 410 rotational levels of SO2 in the 100-1000 K temperature range. A comparison at 30, 100 and 300 K of the IOS data with the corresponding para-H-2 CS results indicates that the IOS approximation systematically underestimates the CS results by a factor up to 2 at the lowest temperatures. As expected, IOS and CS rates are in a better agreement at higher temperatures. Considering that the IOS theory was developed for collisions with para-H-2, this approach cannot describe with the same accuracy collisions with ortho-H-2. So, our IOS data may be considered as quite reliable for collisions with para-H-2 and less accurate for collisions with ortho-H-2.
