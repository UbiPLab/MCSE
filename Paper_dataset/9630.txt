AB With the rapid development of information communication technologies, industrial manufacturing environments and requirements have changed considerably. Since wireless sensor networks have become more and more popular, our production chains have improved with respect to efficiency, flexibility and security. On the other hand, building a secure, robust and fast network is an essential issue for enterprises. In the past, few experts focused on this issue of industrial applications and most of solutions proposed are not suitable for industrial environments. In this paper, we propose a real-time routing protocol for mobile wireless sensor nodes in industrial environments, which offers superior quality of service in terms of delay time. We use geographic routing and information contained in the nodes routing table to extract location information. Then we calculate the node which is nearest to the target node to reduce hop counts and achieve fast data package transfers. It optimizes the packets forwarding hops, which in turn reduces the delay time effectively. We used OPNET to analyze our protocol and results indicate that this algorithm is useful and suitable for wireless sensor networks.
