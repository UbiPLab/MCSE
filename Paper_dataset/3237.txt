AB In cloud computing, resources are dynamic, and the demands placed on the resources allocated to a particular task are diverse. These factors could lead to load imbalances, which affect scheduling efficiency and resource utilization. A scheduling method called interlacing peak is proposed. First, the resource load information, such as CPU, I/O, and memory usage, is periodically collected and updated, and the task information regarding CPU, I/O, and memory is collected. Second, resources are sorted into three queues according to the loads of the CPU, I/O, and memory: CPU intensive, I/O intensive, and memory intensive, according to their demands for resources. Finally, once the tasks have been scheduled, they need to interlace the resource load peak. Some types of tasks need to be matched with the resources whose loads correspond to a lighter types of tasks. In other words, CPU-intensive tasks should be matched with resources with low CPU utilization; I/O-intensive tasks should be matched with resources with shorter I/O wait times; and memory-intensive tasks should be matched with resources that have lowmemory usage. The effectiveness of this method is proved from the theoretical point of view. It has also been proven to be less complex in regard to time and place. Four experiments were designed to verify the performance of this method. Experiments leverage four metrics: 1) average response time; 2) load balancing; 3) deadline violation rates; and 4) resource utilization. The experimental results show that this method can balance loads and improve the effects of resource allocation and utilization effectively. This is especially true when resources are limited. In this way, many tasks will compete for the same resources. However, this method shows advantage over other similar standard algorithms.
