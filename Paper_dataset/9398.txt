AB Computing is experiencing a significant change from client/server towards the cloud. The interest in cloud arrangements is not simply imposed in the business creation, but as well covers to government agencies. Managers of together segments therefore requisite to get a strong interpretation of how this original period will progress in the future, in order to fittingly respond to a shifting economic and technological setting. In the present study, we deal with the dynamic of cloud computing. We impose a new algorithm depending on a fractional calculus concept, utilizing the difference method. This method is suggested for huge data (infinite number of variables). Therefore, we describe the formal observer of a fractional dynamical multi-agent system (non homogenous case) in a fractional space. We show that the solution is bounded for some domain and approximate by time, ignoring positions of the agents.
