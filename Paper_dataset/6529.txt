AB The objective of this work is to develop and apply a spectral graph theoretic approach for differentiating between (classifying) additive manufactured (AM) parts contingent on the severity of their dimensional variation from laser-scanned coordinate measurements (3D point cloud). The novelty of the approach is in invoking spectral graph Laplacian eigenvalues as an extracted feature from the laser-scanned 3D point cloud data in conjunction with various machine learning techniques. The outcome is a new method that classifies the dimensional variation of an AM part by sampling less than 5% of the 2 million 3D point cloud data acquired (per part). This is a practically important result, because it reduces the measurement burden for postprocess quality assurance in AM-parts can be laser-scanned and their dimensional variation quickly assessed on the shop floor. To realize the research objective, the procedure is as follows. Test parts are made using the fused filament fabrication (FFF) polymer AM process. The FFF process conditions are varied per a phased design of experiments plan to produce parts with distinctive dimensional variations. Subsequently, each test part is laser scanned and 3D point cloud data are acquired. To classify the dimensional variation among parts, Laplacian eigenvalues are extracted from the 3D point cloud data and used as features within different machine learning approaches. Six machine learning approaches are juxtaposed: sparse representation, k-nearest neighbors, neural network, naive Bayes, support vector machine, and decision tree. Of these, the sparse representation technique provides the highest classification accuracy (F-score > 97%).
