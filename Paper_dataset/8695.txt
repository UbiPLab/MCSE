AB Cloud computing as a new concept in information technology refers to a set of virtual resources which offers a set of hardware and software services to the users. Effective data management is a significant concern in any large-scale distributed environment such as cloud computing. This management can be achieved using data replication, which reduces data service time and access latency increases data availability and improves system load balancing. However, replication involves many costs such as storage and energy consumption for holding replica. In this paper, a data replication algorithm called economic model presented in the cloud computing environment which uses from estimated future value method for reducing the cost of data replication. The simulation results show that the proposed replication strategy gives better performance compared to the other algorithms.
