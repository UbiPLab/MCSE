AB Energy efficient virtual machine (VM) consolidation in modern data centers is typically optimized using methods such as Mixed Integer Programming, which typically require precise input to the model. Unfortunately, many parameters are uncertain or very difficult to predict precisely in the real world. As a consequence, a once calculated solution may be highly infeasible in practice. In this paper, we use methods from robust optimization theory in order to quantify the impact of uncertainty in modern data centers. We study the impact of different parameter uncertainties on the energy efficiency and overbooking ratios such as e.g. VM resource demands, migration related overhead or the power consumption model of the servers used. We also show that setting aside additional resource to cope with uncertainty of workload influences the overbooking ration of the servers and the energy consumption. We show that, by using our model, Cloud operators can calculate a more robust migration schedule leading to higher total energy consumption. A more risky operator may well choose a more opportunistic schedule leading to lower energy consumption but also higher risk of SLA violation.
