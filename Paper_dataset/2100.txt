AB Reliability is an important research topic of distributed systems. To achieve fault-tolerance in the distributed systems, healthy processors need to reach an agreement before performing certain special tasks, even if faults exist in many circumstances. In order to achieve fault-tolerance in distributed systems, one must deal with the Byzantine Agreement (BA) problem. However, the traditional BA problem is solved in well-defined networks, but the cloud computing environment is increasing in popularity. It can provide a large number of applications in the Internet. Therefore, the BA problem is re-examined to enhance the reliability of cloud computing environment in this paper. The proposed protocol can reach a secure service agreement while tolerating the maximum number of faulty processor in a minimal number of message exchanges under dual failure mode by using type of service requirement (service chip) and key (Signsk). Furthermore, our protocol is more adapting to the changeability of network, such as the mobility of processors than other works.
