AB With the rapid development of cloud storage and quantum computing, ensuring the integrity of the outsourced data for data owners becomes a serious concern. To address this problem, the existing protocols for auditing cloud storage are usually based on the post-quantum cryptographies to check data integrity. Nevertheless, these protocols employ heavy cryptographic operations to construct the data tags, making their efficiency low and extensibility poor. In this paper, we take a new perspective and explore the possibility of designing secure cloud storage (SCS) protocols based on the ring learning with errors problem. Instead of matrix variables, our protocol only utilizes vector variables to generate data block tags so that it has a much lower computational complexity. We then give a strict security proof of cheating resistance against the malicious cloud and privacy guarantee against the curious third-party auditor. We also extend the proposed protocol to support data dynamics and batch auditing for more application scenarios. As a further contribution, we summarize a systematic framework for designing the lattice-based SCS protocols. Finally, exhaustive performance analysis and comparison are provided to verify that the proposed protocol outperforms the existing lattice-based SCS protocols in terms of both operational efficiency and functional extensibility.
