   Multi-user interaction
AB To develop cooperative content based on the hand gestures of multiple users, typical frameworks must be separately used for the communication among computers and hand gesture recognition. In this paper, we propose a framework that enables users who are far apart to interact using hand gestures in the same virtual environment. This approach makes possible remote cooperative education content. We present the design of a server and client, as well as techniques for respectively managing multiple users, controlling crashes among multiple users, and managing gesture data for activating the proposed framework on clouds. To verify that the framework enables multiple users to interact, we developed a virtual chemical experiment based on the proposed design and performed the simulation with it. The framework can be used for a variety of educational content using interactions among multiple users.
