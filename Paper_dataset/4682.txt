ID KEYWORD SEARCHES
AB Currently, searchable encryption becomes the focus topic with the emerging cloud computing paradigm. The existing research schemes are mainly semantic extensions of multiple keywords. However, the semantic information carried by the keywords is limited and does not respond well to the content of the document. And when the original scheme constructs the conceptual graph, it ignores the context information of the topic sentence, which leads to errors in the semantic extension. In this paper, we define and construct semantic search encryption scheme for context-based conceptual graph (ESSEC). We make contextual contact with the central key attributes in the topic sentence and extend its semantic information, so as to improve the accuracy of the retrieval and semantic relevance. Finally, experiments based on real data show that the scheme is effective and feasible.
