AB Several major international sporting events will be held in Japan around 2020. ICT is indispensable For the smooth management of these events. Thorough preparations and flawless execution during such events are required. In developing the system platform, it is also necessary to take into consideration unique aspects of major sporting events, such as the requirement that the systems run uninterruptedly, the fact that the events are one-offs, and also the fact that the preparation period is short. The conventional on-premise model often employed in system development is unsuitable with regard to these aspects as it is too onerous in terms of time required for platform arrangement and implementation, excessive system configuration, and functional redundancy. To address these issues, Fujitsu is constructing a private cloud infrastructure that leverages cloud computing technology to realize shorter installation period, high availability, and Flexible scalability. We are also promoting efficient operation and management by integrating common application Functions. This paper describes the development of system platforms for major sporting events that offer superior reliability and efficiency For managing such events.
