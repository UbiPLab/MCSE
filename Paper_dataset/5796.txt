AB Ambient intelligence systems try to perceive the environment and react, proactively and pervasively to improve people's environmental conditions. A current challenge in Ambient intelligence is trying to mitigate environmental risks that affect global public health, such as increasing air pollution. This paper presents the analysis of some environmental variables related to indoor air pollutants, such as CO, PM2.5, PM10, humidity and temperature; all of these captured in a university environment. The environmental measurements were carried out through a wireless sensor network consisting of two nodes. The cloud computing service, that is, ThingSpeak, was used as the storage medium. With this network, the presence of pollutants in the study area were detected with concentration levels within the permitted ranges, as well as its correlation with the atmospheric variables of temperature and humidity. The implementation of the sensor network allowed the capture of data in a transparent and non-intrusive way, and the analysis allowed the understanding of the behavior of pollutants in indoor spaces, where air circulation is limited, which in the face of high levels of pollution can be harmful to human health.
