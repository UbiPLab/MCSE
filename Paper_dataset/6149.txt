AB Nowadays, cloud services have been providing a wide source of information and yet the expansion of these services has led to their own particular problems in this subject. Discovering of the appropriate resources or services is a major challenge in the cloud computing. Therefore, many methods are proposed to tackle this problem. Also, in the cloud environments, ontology is a description of the concepts and relationships that can exist for a cloud service or group of services. On the other hand, for a certain item, user's interest according to the information of their profiles are predicted by collaborative filtering. It uses a collection of users with similar interests to predict interesting information for target users. However, despite the importance of the semantic relations among the cloud services, a few papers consider these relations to discover the proper resources. Therefore, this paper aims at proposing a method to discover the cloud services via semantic concepts and collaborative filtering. The obtained results from experiments have illustrated that the presented approach improves the efficiency of service discovery in the cloud computing and obtains fewer execution times against the current approaches.
