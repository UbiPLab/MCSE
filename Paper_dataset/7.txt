AB Fog computing is an increasingly popular method with which to process the huge amount of data generated by the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and applications at the edge-level, using the heterogeneous autonomous end-devices of the participating users. To meet the requirements of the IoT and time-sensitive applications, a Fog computing platform needs to select appropriate resources, the availability of which can be guaranteed during the execution of the application. For the proper selection of resources, the platform must be able to predict future availability. Hence, a proper resource availability model which provides knowledge about the future availability of resources in the Fog computing environment is required. However, designing an efficient resource availability model, in a highly distributed and mobile environment like the Fog, is a complex task due to the multidimensional characteristics of Fog devices, such as mobility, lack of centralised control, limited resources, and being battery powered. Existing resource availability models did not consider all the characteristics of a real Fog environment. Therefore, this study aims to provide a generic continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC), based resource availability model for Fog computing environments. The applicability of the model is shown by integrating the model input with the nearest-location best fit (NLBF) and Best-Fit resource selection policies.
