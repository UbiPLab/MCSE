AB The new era of Internet of Everything (IoE) is progressively making items online, but centralized cloud data processing does not scale to desires of the environment. The performance degradation can be seen in the cloud applications which are deadline like health monitoring and which need lesser response time and delay (instigated by transfer of data to cloud and then cloud to application). Fog computing appears as a solution to reduce the network congestion and latency as in this approach cloud is boosted to the area of the network. Fog computing is a model for handling a virtual and extremely distributed environment which delivers network and compute services between cloud data centres and users. In this paper; a Refinement of Resource Management in Fog Computing Aspect of QoS is proposed for efficient management of resources which considers execution time.
