AB Cloud data center (CDC) network virtualization is being regarded as a promising technology to provide performance guarantee for cloud computing applications. One critical issue in CDC network virtualization technology is virtual data center (VDC) embedding, which deals with the CDC physical resource allocation to virtual nodes (virtual switches and virtual servers) and virtual links of a VDC. When node and link constraints (including CPU, memory, network bandwidth, and network delay) are both taken into account, the VDC embedding problem is NP-hard, even in the offline case. Node heterogeneity and CDC network scale bring challenges to the VDC embedding. This paper aims to embed a VDC in a robust and green way. We propose two effective, computation-efficient and energy-efficient embedding algorithms. Extensive simulations under various network scales and topologies are carried out to compare the proposed algorithms with the existing VDC embedding algorithms in terms of the VDC acceptance ratio, the long-term revenue of the cloud service provider (CSP), the CDC's long-term energy consumption in light-load CDCs, and in terms of CSP's long-term revenue in heavy-load CDCs.
