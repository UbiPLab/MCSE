AB With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), the count of gadgets connected to the Internet has been increased. IoT, as a modern paradigm, has been used to describe the future in which physical things like RFID tags, sensors, actuators, and cellphones can intermingle for achieving shared purposes. Also, we can employ cloud computing for storing the things' information in the IoT. However, this information has been replicated through the network for increasing availability. In this paper, due to the NP-hard nature of the replica selection problem, an improved version of ant colony optimization (IACO) has been applied. The impact of pheromone on the chosen path is converted by ants to invert the underlying logic of ACO. Due to the existence of different IoT centers, the IACO has been employed for selecting the replicated data in the IoT where the load balancing among IoT centers has been considered. In this method, an ant chooses the ideal point for its movement; then others may not pass the track that the preceding ants have been passed. The obtained outcomes have shown that the method has outperformed the ACO, HQFR, and RTRM approaches regarding the waiting time and load balancing.
