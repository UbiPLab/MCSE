AB The Internet of Things is a trending future technological revolution that emerging distributed computing and real-time based application and its development depends on dynamic technical innovation in a number of important fields from wireless sensors to nanotechnology. Cloud integration with IoT made things more convenient and easy. Clock synchronization between systems in a distributed network is the complex and tedious job. It is mandatory to get sync with other and source as well. There are many proposed ways of data synchronization protocols like NTP, global position system to maintain sync process between Systems or IoT devices network. In this paper, we are proposing a clock synchronization approach to sync clocks between IoTs and Cloud which are connected with each other in distributed network. Here we have used cloud service Software as a Service to collect the information to analysis and trigger the results action to IoTs. In this paper, we present the Clock Synchronization based on precision time protocol between IoTs simulation model for Omnet++ with INET framework, which allows us to check clock sync accuracy with a different network configured topologies. We have tried to minimize the clock drift with clock offset updating and with master-slave phenomena also minimize the master-slave delay. To show our simulation results we have used chunks nodes of IoTs in distributed manner placed in different places with different clock values. The simulation result shows that proposed approach works in the desired manner within ideal and network delay symmetry.
