AB This study aims to use the big data thinking method in the training management of professional basketball clubs. The big data thinking and data analysis capabilities of clubs should be strengthened. Open Internet, a "cloud computing" center, a data mining and analysis system, and a terminal server that can store huge amounts of data are required by clubs. These clubs also need to avail of the services of professional data analysts to improve the efficiency of data processing and receive powerful data support that can help coaches make scientific decisions rapidly. Data are collected from sport facility sensors, athlete wearable devices, cameras in the field, and terminal equipment in the hands of the media and the fans. Big data analysis can provide insights on how to gain an advantage in a sport competition and provide fans worldwide with personalized experience. Experimental results show that the proposed method can substantially improve the overall performance of a club.
