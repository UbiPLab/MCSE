AB The tremendous increase in global industrial activity has resulted in high utilization of natural energy resources and increase in global warming over the last few decades. Meanwhile, computing has become a popular utility of modern human lifestyle. With the increased popularity of computing and IT services, the corresponding energy consumption of the IT industry has also increased rapidly. The computing community realizes the importance of green measures and provides technological solutions that lead to its energy-aware operations along with facilitating the same in other IT enabled industries. Green and sustainable computing practices review the environmental impact of the computing industry to encourage the adoption of practices and technologies for efficient operations. "Green Computing" paradigm advocates the energy-proportional and efficient usage of computing resources in all emerging technologies, such as Big Data and Internet of Things (IoT). This article presents a review of green computing techniques amidst the emerging IT technologies that are evident in our society. The best practices for green computing and the trade-off between green and high-performance policies is debated. Further, we discuss the imminent challenges facing the efficient green operations of emerging IT technologies.
