AB Availability evaluation of a virtualized system is critical to the wide deployment of cloud computing services. Time-based, prediction-based rejuvenation of virtual machines (VM) and virtual machine monitors, VM failover and live VM migration are common high-availability (HA) techniques in a virtualized system. This paper investigates the effect of combination of these availability techniques on VM availability in a virtualized system where various software and hardware failures may occur. For each combination, we construct analytic models rejuvenation mechanisms to improve VM availability; (2) prediction-based rejuvenation enhances VM availability much more than time-based VM rejuvenation when prediction successful probability is above 70%, regardless failover and/or live VM migration is also deployed; (3) failover mechanism outperforms live VM migration, although they can work together for higher availability of VM. In addition, they can combine with software rejuvenation mechanisms for even higher availability; (4) and time interval setting is critical to a time-based rejuvenation mechanism. These analytic results provide guidelines for deploying and parameter setting of HA techniques in a virtualized system.
