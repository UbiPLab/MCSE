AB Cloud computing provides distributed computing resources such as servers, storage and applications to the end users through data centers. The data centers are geographically located at different locations. The client applications or requests being serviced by cloud service providers on "pay per use". So, different pricing models are adapted to compute the cost and revenue of the data centers. The cost of VM is computed depending on its placement in the data centers through broker policies. So, the broker policies have a significant role in evaluating the cost of the VM which directly impacts on revenue of the service provider. In the computing competition, the VM cost should be minimized by which service demand will be maximized. Moreover, the response time and processing time of the data centers need to be minimized to posses commendatory Quality of Service. In this work, we propose a new service broker policy to minimize the total cost. The total cost considers the VM cost and the data transfer cost. The proposed mechanism also reduces the response time and data processing time of the data centers. The proposed policy is simulated in Cloud Analyst. We examine the performance of the proposed mechanism with ten different scenarios. Finally, we compare performance results with respect to VM cost, data transfer cost, total cost, processing time and response time of data centers with the existing policies and observe better than these.
