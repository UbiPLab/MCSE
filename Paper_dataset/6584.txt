AB Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been widely used in many applications recently. As an important application of the WSNs, the wireless medical sensor networks (WMSNs) could improve health-care quality and have become significant in the modern medical system. WMSNs devices typically have limited computing, storage and communication capabilities. To enhance the capabilities of WSNs, cloud-assisted WMSNs have been introduced, and they can provide more efficient processing of cloud users' medical data records stored in the cloud. The integrity of medical data records is very important since these data will be used to provide a medical diagnosis and other medical treatments. In this paper, we propose an efficient integrity verification scheme for medical data records in cloud-assisted WMSNs. Based on elliptic curve digital signature algorithm, we construct linearly homomorphic authenticator, so that the third party auditor (TPA) can verify the the integrity of medical data records without bringing in new security threats. TPA does not need to retrieve the entire medical data records, thus can dramatically reduce the communication and computation overhead. Moreover, we further extend our scheme to support batch integrity verification for multiple cloud users simultaneously. In particular, to achieve efficient medical data dynamic operations, using index hash tables, our scheme can execute dynamic operations efficiently. Performance comparison shows that our scheme is more light-weight, and can be used much more practically in cloud-assisted WMSNs.
