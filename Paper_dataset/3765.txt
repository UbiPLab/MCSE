AB Virtualization technology boosts up traditional computing concept to cloud computing by introducing Virtual Machines (VMs) over the Physical Machines (PMs), which enables the cloud service providers to share the limited computing and network resources among multiple users. Virtual resource mapping can be defined as the process of embedding multiple VMs and their network resource demand onto multiple inter-connected PMs. The existing mechanisms of resource mapping need to be efficient enough to minimize the number of PMs without compromising the deadline of the tasks assigned to the VMs, which is NP-hard. To deal with this problem, a Link based Virtual Resource Management (LVRM) algorithm is designed to map the VMs onto PMs based on the available and required resources of the PMs and VMs, respectively. The designed algorithm exploits the fact that the demanded network bandwidth among VMs should be given higher priority while allocating the physical resources to the inter-connected virtual machines as insufficient network bandwidth may detain the task execution. The proposed algorithm is evaluated by a discrete event simulator and is compared with similar virtual network embedded algorithms. Simulation results show that LVRM can outperform over other network embedded algorithms.
