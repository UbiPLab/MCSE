AB With the advances of network function virtualization and cloud computing technologies, a number of network services are implemented across data centers by creating a service chain using different virtual network functions (VNFs) running on virtual machines. Due to the complexity of network infrastructure, creating a service chain requires high operational cost especially in carrier-grade network service providers and supporting stringent QoS requirements from users is also a complicated task. There have been various research efforts to address these problems that only focus on one aspect of optimization goal either from users such as latency minimization and QoS based optimization, or from service providers such as resource optimization and cost minimization. However, meeting the requirements both from users and service providers efficiently is still a challenging issue. This paper proposes a VNF placement algorithm called VNF-EQ that allows users to meet their service latency requirements, while minimizing the energy consumption at the same time. The proposed algorithm is dynamic in a sense that the locations or the service chains of VNFs are reconfigured to minimize the energy consumption when the traffic passing through the chain falls below a pre-defined threshold. We use genetic algorithm to formulate this problem because it is a variation of the multi-constrained path selection problem known as NP-complete. The benchmarking results show that the proposed approach outperforms other heuristic algorithms by as much as 49% and reduces the energy consumptions by rearranging VNFs.
