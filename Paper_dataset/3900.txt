AB This paper will present a new computing methodology based on the application of cognitive information systems in transformative computing tasks. This methodology is an innovative approach to the tasks of transformative computing, which - based on the techniques of collection of data obtained from various sources and registered by means of various sensors - serve the purpose of their appropriate classification. Enhancing the here-discussed techniques by aspects of their semantic description and interpretation will make it possible to execute the processes of analysis, distribution and management of data/information obtained from various sources and simultaneously classified by means of transformative techniques. A novelty of the presented approach is an attempt to use cognitive methods of data description and analysis in the classification process, executed on the basis of the semantic, meaning description of large data sets. The presented transformative computing methodology will be used as an innovative approach to the implementation of complex computational and transmission tasks, that can be implemented using advanced data processing techniques. However, these techniques will be based on the possibility of deep analysis of semantic decks of various data sets recorded in the form of signals.
