AB Law enforcement all over the world is struggling with time-critical access to evidence stored in electronic devices. At times these devices may be located in foreign territories or in cloud service providers' servers. Considering the decentralization of the Internet and the ubiquity and complexity of cloud computing, the exact location of the data in question may not always be possible to determine. Both conditions-the possibly extraterritorially located data and the inability to identify the location of the dataraise questions regarding the legal limits of law enforcement's access to such data. To tackle these issues, this article examines potential options for accessing extraterritorial data during a criminal investigation. In particular, the article will focus on the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime's remote search and seizure procedures and analyses whether these provisions have been transposed to the Estonian Code of Criminal Procedure. Further, by comparing the legislation and practice of remote search and seizure in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany, the article reflects upon the current European legal discussions that will likely inform the future regulation of transborder access and suggests potential options for the reform of domestic procedures.
