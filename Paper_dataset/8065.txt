ID INTEGRATION
AB Data integration continues to baffle researchers even though substantial progress has been made. Although the emergence of technologies such as XML, web services, semantic web and cloud computing have helped, a system in which biologists are comfortable articulating new applications and developing them without technical assistance from a computing expert is yet to be realised. The distance between a friendly graphical interface that does little, and a 'traditional' system though clunky yet powerful, is deemed too great more often than not. The question that remains unanswered is, if a user can state her query involving a set of complex, heterogeneous and distributed life sciences resources in an easy to use language and execute it without further help from a computer savvy programmer. In this paper, we present a declarative meta-language, called VisFlow, for requirement specification, and a translator for mapping requirements into executable queries in a variant of SQL augmented with integration artefacts.
