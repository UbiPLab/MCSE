DE Cloud computing; privacy preserving; searchable encryption
AB This research revisits the fundamental problem of processing privacy-preserving Boolean queries over outsourced databases on untrusted public clouds. Much current searchable encryption (SE) schemes try to seek an appropriate trade-off between security and efficiency, yet most of them suffer from an unacceptable query leakage due to their conjunctive/disjunctive terms that are processed individually. We show, however, this trade-off still can be deeply optimized for more security. We consider a Boolean formula as a set of deterministic finite automatons (DFAs) and propose a novel approach to running an encrypted DFA, which can be effectively and efficiently processed by the cloud. We give three constructions for conjunctive, disjunctive, and Boolean queries, respectively. Their notable advantages are single-round, highly-efficient, adaptively-secure, and leakage-minimized. A lot of experiments are made to evaluate overall efficiency. Testing results show that the schemes achieve enhanced security almost without sacrificing anything of search efficiency.
