AB Cloud manufacturing (CMfg) is a service-oriented platform that enables engineers to use the manufacturing capacity in the form of cloud-based services that aggregated in service pools on demand. In CMfg, the integration of manufacturing resources across different areas and industries is accomplished using cloud services. In recent years, the interest in cloud manufacturing service composition has grown, due to its importance in different manufacturing applications. When no single service is capable of satisfying the need for a manufacturing service requester, the service combination may be useful in order to fulfill the purpose of the manufacturing service requester. Therefore, the problem of how efficient and effective interconnection of cloud manufactring services has come to fetch many research fields. In this paper, a new algorithm is presented using an ant colony optimization for the problem of cloud manufacturing service composition considering the quality of service.
