AB Scientific workflows have become a standardized way for scientists to represent a set of tasks to overcome/solve a certain scientific problem. Usually these workflows consist of numerous CPU and I/O-intensive jobs that are executed using workflow management systems (WfMS), on clouds, grids, supercomputers, etc. Previously, it was shown that using k-way partitioning to distribute a workflow's tasks between multiple machines in the cloud reduces the overall data communication and therefore lowers the cost of the bandwidth usage. A framework was built to automate this process of partitioning and execution of any workflow submitted by a scientist that is meant to be run on Pegasus WfMS, in the cloud, with ease. The framework provisions the instances in the cloud using CloudML, configures and installs all the software needed for the execution, partitions and runs the provided scientific workflow, also showing the estimated makespan and cost.
