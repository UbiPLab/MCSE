AB With recent advances of information and communication technology, smart city has been emerged as a new paradigm to dynamically optimize the resources in cities and provide better facilities and quality of life for the citizens. Smart cities involve a variety of components, including ubiquitous sensing devices, heterogeneous networks, large-scale databases, and powerful data centers to collect, transfer, store, and intelligently process real-time information. Smart cities can offer new applications and services for augmenting the daily life of citizens on making decisions, energy consumption, transportation, healthcare, and education. Despite the potential vision of smart cities, security and privacy issues remain to be carefully addressed. This paper delineates a comprehensive survey of security and privacy issues of smart cities, and presents a basis for categorizing the present and future developments within this area. It also presents a thematic taxonomy of security and privacy issues of smart cities to highlight the security requirements for designing a secure smart city, identify the existing security and privacy solutions, and present open research issues and challenges of security and privacy in smart cities.
