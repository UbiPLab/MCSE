AB Presently, optical access networks are in great demand to meet the bandwidth requirement due to rapid growth in high speed applications for smart devices, cloud computing, big data analysis and other 5G applications. In this paper, 5x10Gb/s wavelength division multiplexing carrier-less amplitude phase modulation-passive optical network (WDM-CAP-PON) with frequency comb is proposed and demonstrated. Also, 450nm blue laser diode having bandwidth 0.8GHz is used for visible light communication using 6m FSO link to support cost effective high data rate optical network. The WDM-CAP-PON employing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing has been analysed in terms of tolerance to the fiber non-linearities through the effect of variations in launch power (-5 to 4dBm), datarate (2.5-40Gb/s) and distance (20-110km) on Q-factor and error vector magnitude (EVM%) by considering pre-, post- and symmetrical-dispersion compensation schemes. It is reported that post-compensation is superior to pre- and symmetrical-compensation schemes to achieve the minimum 3.8x10(-3) BER under 7% forward error correction (FEC). The faithful transmission distance achieved for 10Gb/s WDM-CAP-PON using post dispersion compensation scheme is 110km.
