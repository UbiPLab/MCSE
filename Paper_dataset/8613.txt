AB In multi cloud environments, we need to find services from multiple clouds, if a single cloud cannot give us all the required component services. In such a situation, however, it is challenging to find an appropriate composition sequence by taking into consideration load balancing between the different clouds and in the same time by minimising the composite service cost and response time. In this paper, an agent-based cloud service composition architecture is presented. It includes two main agents CSCA and CMA which use MCDA methods to support cloud services selection. These agents use load balancing mechanisms and the CNP in order to evolve and adapt cloud service composition. We have performed a comprehensive analytical and experimental study to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. The experimental results, based on CloudSim simulator, show that the proposed architecture can effectively achieve good performance (load balancing), improve the response time and minimise cost.
