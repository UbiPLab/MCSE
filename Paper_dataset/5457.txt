AB This platform relies on an IoT and a cloud computing technology to watch Industrial Pollution Monitoring and control the quality of environment in anywhere and anytime. An IoT-based system to monitor and control the pollutants andthereby helping them to moderate their trial on exposure topollutants. Industrial pollution monitoring is the collection of data at different locations of industries and at regular interval frames so as to give the information which might be utilized to characterize current conditions. Pollution Monitoring and controlling System demonstrates an efficient utilization of technology by which screen and report environmental parameters like gas, smoke and temperature and humidity. An efficient environmental monitoring system is required to monitor and assess the conditions just in case of exceeding the prescribed level of parameters (e.g., noise, CO and radiation levels). A solution for monitoring the noise and air pollution levels in industrial environment or particular area of interest using embedded computing system is proposed. This paper proposes an approach to build a cost effective standardize pollution monitoring device using the wireless technology (i.e.) Internet of Things (IoT) and a cloud computing technology.This work discusses the implementation of cloud based IoT system for air quality monitoring which is accessible as a web interface as well as in a type of an android application.
