AB In order to further explore the driving factors of enterprise development, the cloud computing-based enterprise business model innovation driving force model is proposed. Firstly, the development of cloud computing is expounded, supplementing the driving factors of enterprise development. Finally, cloud computing processing model is used to plan the data of enterprise innovation driving force and build a driving innovation model. An optimization and update scheme is put forward from algorithm flow and evaluation model, and an effective identification model is established by effectively evaluating the development pattern of business driving force. In the test of the enterprise innovation driving model, the efficiency of enterprise innovation and the data accuracy of data mining algorithms are tested. The test results show that the addition of computer algorithms makes the innovation efficiency of enterprises and the positioning of enterprises more precise. The model is worth further promotion.
