   This paper presents solutions for smart devices with embedded artificial intelligence dedicated to vehicular applications. Virtual sensors based on neural networks or regressors provide real-time predictions on diesel engine power loss caused by increased exhaust back pressure.
   The actual trade-off among engine emissions and performance requires detailed investigations into exhaust system configurations. Correlations among engine data acquired by sensors are susceptible to artificial intelligence (AI)-driven performance assessment. The influence of exhaust back pressure (EBP) on engine performance, mainly on effective power, was investigated on a turbocharged diesel engine tested on an instrumented dynamometric test-bench. The EBP was externally applied at steady state operation modes defined by speed and load. A complete dataset was collected to supply the statistical analysis and machine learning phases-the training and testing of all the AI solutions developed in order to predict the effective power. By extending the cloud-/edge-computing model with the cloud AI/edge AI paradigm, comprehensive research was conducted on the algorithms and software frameworks most suited to vehicular smart devices. A selection of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and regressors was implemented and evaluated. Two proof-of concept smart devices were built using state-of-the-art technology-one with hardware acceleration for "complete cycle" AI and the other with a compact code and size ("AI in a nut-shell") with ANN coefficients embedded in the code and occasionally offline "statistical re-calibration".
