AB Cloud computing is growing in popularity among computing paradigms, but in practice the energy consumption of the cloud data centers is very high. In this paper, we build the resource model of the cloud data center and the dynamic power model of the physical machine, and then propose a three-dimensional virtual resource scheduling method for energy saving in cloud computing (TVRSM), in which the process of virtual resource scheduling are divided into three stages: virtual resource allocation, virtual resource scheduling and virtual resource optimization. For the different objective of each stage, we design three different algorithms, respectively. The simulation results prove that the TVRSM is able to efficiently allocate and manage the virtual resources in the cloud data center. And compared with other traditional algorithms; the TVRSM can effectively reduce the energy consumption of the cloud data center and significantly minimize the amount of violations of Service Level Agreement (SLA).
