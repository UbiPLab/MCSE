AB As cloud computing becomes popular, the security of users' data is faced with a great threat, i.e., how to protect users' privacy has become a pressing research topic. The combination of data hiding and encryption can provide dual protection for private data during cloud computing. In this paper, we propose a new separable data-hiding scheme for encrypted images based on block compressive sensing. First, the original uncompressed image is compressed and encrypted by block compressive sensing (BCS) using a measurement matrix, which is known as an encryption key. Then, some additional data can be hidden into the four least significant bits of measurement using the data-hiding key during the process of encoding. With an encrypted image that contains hidden data, the receiver can extract the hidden data or decrypt/reconstruct the protected private image, according to the key he/she possesses. This scheme has important features of flexible compression and anti-data-loss. The image reconstruction and data extraction are separate processes. Experimental results have proven the expected merits of the proposed scheme. Compared with the previous work, our proposed scheme reduces the complexity of the scheme and also achieves better performance in compression, anti-data-loss, and hiding capacity.
