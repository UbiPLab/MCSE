AB Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are widely used in telecom, medical, military, cloud computing, and other high-performance computing applications, thanks to their unique combination of parallel hardware execution and reprogrammability. During compilation, the computer-aided design (CAD) tool estimates the maximum operating frequency of the user application based on the worst case timing analysis of the critical path at a fixed nominal supply voltage, which usually results in significant voltage or frequency margin. Hence dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) has great potential to reduce the power overhead in FPGAs; however, the reprogrammability of FPGAs make a safe implementation of DVS for any application that could be programmed into the FPGA challenging. This work presents a robust universal DVS scheme for FPGAs intended to run on a system production line, or regularly during each FPGA power-up. The proposed scheme requires the FPGA to be programmed twice: offline self-calibration and online DVS. During the offline self-calibration, the FPGA frequency and core voltage operating limits at different self-imposed temperatures are automatically found and stored in a calibration table (CT). During online operation, the power stage refers to the CT and dynamically adjusts the core voltage according to the FPGA temperature and the resistive voltage drop in the power delivery path. The proposed DVS scheme is demonstrated on a 60-nm Intel Cyclone IV FPGA, with a digitally controlled dc-dc converter, leading to 40% power savings in two typical applications.
