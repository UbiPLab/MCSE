AB The evolution of cloud computing and a drastic increase in image size are making the outsourcing of image storage and processing an attractive business model. Although this outsourcing has many advantages, ensuring data confidentiality in the cloud is one of the main concerns. There are state-of-the-art encryption schemes for ensuring confidentiality in the cloud. However, such schemes do not allow cloud datacenters to perform operations over encrypted images. In this paper, we address this concern by proposing 2DCrypt, a modified Paillier cryptosystem-based image scaling and cropping scheme for multi-user settings that allows cloud datacenters to scale and crop an image in the encrypted domain. To anticipate a high storage overhead resulted from the naive per-pixel encryption, we propose a space-efficient tiling scheme that allows tile-level image scaling and cropping operations. Basically, instead of encrypting each pixel individually, we are able to encrypt a tile of pixels. 2DCrypt is such that multiple users can view or process the images without sharing any encryption keys-a requirement desirable for practical deployments in real organizations. Our analysis and results show that 2DCrypt is INDistinguishable under Chosen Plaintext Attack secure and incurs an acceptable overhead. When scaling a 512 x 512 image by a factor of two, 2DCrypt requires an image user to download approximately 5.3 times more data than the un-encrypted scaling and need to work approximately 2.3 s more for obtaining the scaled image in a plaintext.
