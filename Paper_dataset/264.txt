AB 5G systems are putting increasing pressure on Telecom operators to enhance users' experience, leading to the development of more techniques with the aim of improving service quality. However, it is essential to take into consideration not only users' demands but also service providers' interests. In this work, we explore policies that satisfy both views. We first formulate a mathematical model to compute End-to-End (E2E) delay experienced by mobile users in Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) environments. Then, dynamic Virtual Machine (VM) allocation policies are presented, with the objective of satisfying mobile users Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, while optimally using the cloud resources by exploiting VM resource reuse.Thus, maximizing the service providers' profit should be ensured while providing the service required by users. We further demonstrate the benefits of these policies in comparison with previous works.
