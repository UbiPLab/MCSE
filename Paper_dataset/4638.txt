AB The new paradigm of Cloud Computing currently identifies itself as anarcho-capitalist political theory. Its objective is to exploit the virtual territory through digital profiling in order to influence citizen-consumers' political preferences. The purpose of the so-called liquid democracy is the suppression of old state techno-bureaucracies, and the promotion of new digital techno-bureaucracies, whose operating mechanisms are even darker than the previous ones. In the name of a brand new free of charge, automatic, and negative freedom, instead of claiming a larger public space for exercising its practical reason and defend republican freedom, Citizenship 2.0 has granted a mandate of private government to the owners of Cloud Computing to protect their private rights.
