AB Through the rapid evolution of information technology, there are many innovative services and products bring a lot of convenience for people especially "Cloud Computing". The cloud computing provides users more than personal computer's storage resources and calculate ability. Nowadays the most consume hard drive space or calculate resources are belong to multimedia applications, such like HD videos, HD computer games and so on. Because of the reason of the requirement, the cloud computing technology also develop multimedia cloud. The multimedia cloud is evolved from media cloud and multimedia-aware cloud, combine with the highly calculate ability, high quality of service and virtually unlimited storage space. Users can put all the multimedia content or games into the multimedia cloud. But there is still a harassment, the "Information Security". Before users can use multimedia cloud, they must go through an insecure network environment between cloud services and user's equipment. Malicious attackers usually attack this insecure section to capture user's information. Besides the privacy of the user's data in the multimedia cloud is also a fatal reason that why users don't use this convenience and powerful service. In this article, we provide a smart card based secure authentication mechanism and a protect user's data authorization framework. We expect the framework can protect users' privacy and their data.
