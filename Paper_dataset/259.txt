AB Flood susceptibility mapping is essential for characterizing flood risk zones and for planning mitigation approaches. Using a multi-criteria decision support system, this study investigated a flood susceptible region in Bihar, India. It used a combination of the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and geographic information system (GIS)/remote sensing (RS) with a cloud computing API on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Five main flood-causing criteria were broadly selected, namely hydrologic, morphometric, permeability, land cover dynamics, and anthropogenic interference, which further had 21 sub-criteria. The relative importance of each criterion prioritized as per their contribution toward flood susceptibility and weightage was given by an AHP pair-wise comparison matrix (PCM). The most and least prominent flood-causing criteria were hydrologic (0.497) and anthropogenic interference (0.037), respectively. An area of similar to 3000 sq km (40.36%) was concentrated in high to very high flood susceptibility zones that were in the vicinity of rivers, whereas an area of similar to 1000 sq km (12%) had very low flood susceptibility. The GIS-AHP technique provided useful insights for flood zone mapping when a higher number of parameters were used in GEE. The majorities of detected flood susceptible areas were flooded during the 2019 floods and were mostly located within 500 m of the rivers' paths.
