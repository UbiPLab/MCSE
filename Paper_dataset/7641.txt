AB A remote data integrity checking is a crucial technology for cloud storage services because of an increasing threat against user data outsourced in remote cloud servers. Recently, integrity checking protocols have been proposed and in particular for batch auditing. However, they cannot efficiently identify corrupted clouds when batch auditing fails. In this paper, we propose a new protocol to identify a single corrupted cloud in multi-cloud environments without requiring any repeated auditing processes. We analyze the performance of our protocol and compare it with the previous work. By utilizing composite-order bilinear groups, we extend our protocol to support the identification of multiple corrupted clouds.
