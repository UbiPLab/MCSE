AB Cloud computing is now being deployed in real world to satisfy several users' requirements for computation. In the point of management, there are several important considerations such as availability, reliability, resource utilization, and throughput in cloud computing. However, since these performance metrics are affected by the many uncorrelated parameters, it is very hard task to derive new model which takes into them account together. Even though there are many feasible models, fuzzy logic can be the most suitable one in the view of depth, popularity and applicability in many other research areas. However, as far as the authors know, there is only one short survey paper which focuses on introducing research challenges without detail discussion of each mechanism. Based on this deficiency, in this paper, we present the state-of-the-art approaches and their important features in fuzzy logic based cloud computing. First, we present overview of cloud computing and categorization for the current research works. Second, we also provide some of the key techniques presented in the recent literature and provide a summary of related research works. Finally, we suggest potential directions for future research in the field.
