AB The concept of service composition can provide the complex functionality for users. As the widespread application of cloud computing, the number of services grows exponentially. It becomes more difficult to find out the optimal service composition solution quickly. This paper proposes a nonlinear service composition method based on the Skyline operator. The Skyline operator is to find a collection of data that cannot be dominated by others, which is used to prune the redundant services to reduce the search space. Then the service composition problem is formulated as a nonlinear integer programming model by a mathematical programming language (AMPL), and solved by the existing nonlinear solvers Bonmin. The experiments show that the proposed method can effectively improve the efficiency of service composition, while ensuring the quality of solution.
