AB Cloud computing provided a framework for seamless access to resources through network. Access to resources is quantified through SLA between service providers and users. Service provider tries to best exploit their resources and reduce idle times of the resources. Growing energy concerns further makes the life of service providers miserable. User's requests are served by allocating users tasks to resources in Clouds and Grid environment through scheduling algorithms and planning algorithms. With only few Planning algorithms in existence rarely planning and scheduling algorithms are differentiated. This paper proposes a robust hybrid planning algorithm, Robust Heterogeneous-Earliest-Finish-Time (RHEFT)(1) for binding tasks to VMs. The allocation of tasks to VMs is based on a novel task matching algorithm called Interior Scheduling. The consistent performance of proposed RHEFT algorithm is compared with Heterogeneous-Earliest-Finish-Time (HEFT)(2) and Distributed HEFT (DHEFT)(3) for various parameters like utilization ratio, makespan, Speed-up and Energy Consumption. RHEFT's consistent performance against HEFT and DHEFT has established the robustness of the hybrid planning algorithm through rigorous simulations.
