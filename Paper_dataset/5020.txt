AB With the integration of new technologies such as smart technologies and cloud computing in the industrial Internet of Things, the complexity of industrial IoT applications is increasing. Real-time performance and determinism are becoming serious challenges for system implementation in these Internet of Things systems, especially in critical security areas. This paper provides a framework for a software-defined bus-based intelligent robot system and designs scheduling algorithms to make TTEthernet play the role of scheduling in the framework. Through the framework, the non-real-time and uncertainties problem of distributed robotic systems can be solved. Moreover, a fragment strategy was proposed to solve the problem of large delay caused by Rate-Constrained traffic. Experimental results indicate that the improved scheme based on fragmentation strategy proposed in this paper can improve the real-time performance of RC traffic to a certain extent. Besides, this paper made a performance test and comparison experiments of the improved scheme in the simulation software to verify the feasibility of the improved scheme. The result showed that the delay of Rate-Constrained traffic was reduced and the utilization rate of network was improved.
