AB Due to the significant advancement of wireless and mobile technology, the applications targeted for these are getting more and more complex and demanding of high power and resources. The cloud-assisted software-defined wireless sensor networking (CSDWSN) paradigm has emerged as a promising solution to perform these highly demanding tasks with the help of powerful cloud servers. However, due to the dynamic variation in sensor users demands, it is becoming challenging for a single CSDWSN provider to always provide a sufficient amount of computing resources to fulfill users needs. This paper exhibits an approach of resource and revenue sharing with coalition development among CSDWSN providers. The proposed method models the collaborations among the CSDWSN providers as a coalition game. As opposed to existing methodologies, the game model goes for amplifying the individual revenue of CSDWSN providers with minimum energy consumption by analyzing their internal users demand and dynamic pricing strategy. In addition, the proposed game enables a socially optimal and stable coalition structure, which leads to both increased total profit of a federation and improved equality among participating CSDWSN providers. Various simulation experiments were completed to demonstrate the viability of the proposed cooperative game model.
