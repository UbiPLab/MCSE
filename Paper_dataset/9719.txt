AB Small cells have emerged as a useful tool for supporting increased network capacity through network densification, but they can also be used to support edge cloud computing services. In this paper, we provide a preview of an innovative concept that tackles the consolidation of multi-tenancy in such type communications infrastructures, as well as the placement of network intelligence and applications in the network edge. After surveing the challenges and the enabling technologies, we present the envisaged architecture to manage and control the Cloud-Enabled Small Cell infrastructure. Also, at the operation level, we explain the potential advantages of adopting the proposed solutions on the long-term evolution access networks. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
