AB Large-scale scientific problems are often modeled as workflows. The ever-growing data and compute requirements of these applications has led to extensive research on how to efficiently schedule and deploy them in distributed environments. The emergence of the latest distributed systems paradigm, cloud computing, brings with it tremendous opportunities to run scientific workflows at low costs without the need of owning any infrastructure. It provides a virtually infinite pool of resources that can be acquired, configured, and used as needed and are charged on a pay-per-use basis. However, along with these benefits come numerous challenges that need to be addressed to generate efficient schedules. This work identifies these challenges and studies existing algorithms from the perspective of the scheduling models they adopt as well as the resource and application model they consider. A detailed taxonomy that focuses on features particular to clouds is presented, and the surveyed algorithms are classified according to it. In this way, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of existing literature and aid researchers by providing an insight into future directions and open issues.
