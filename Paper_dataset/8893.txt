AB For enterprise systems running on public clouds in which the servers are outside the control domain of the enterprise, access control that was traditionally executed by reference monitors deployed on the system servers can no longer be trusted. Hence, a self-contained security scheme is regarded as an effective way for protecting outsourced data. However, building such a scheme that can implement the access control policy of the enterprise has become an important challenge. In this paper, we propose a self-contained data protection mechanism called RBAC-CPABE by integrating role-based access control (RBAC), which is widely employed in enterprise systems, with the ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE). First, we present a data-centric RBAC (DC-RBAC) model that supports the specification of fine-grained access policy for each data object to enhance RBAC's access control capabilities. Then, we fuse DC-RBAC and CP-ABE by expressing DC-RBAC policies with the CP-ABE access tree and encrypt data using CP-ABE. Because CP-ABE enforces both access control and decryption, access authorization can be achieved by the data itself. A security analysis and experimental results indicate that RBAC-CPABE maintains the security and efficiency properties of the CP-ABE scheme on which it is based, but substantially improves the access control capability. Finally, we present an implemented framework for RBAC-CPABE to protect privacy and enforce access control for data stored in the cloud.
