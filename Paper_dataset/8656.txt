AB In this paper, we devise a novel offloading policy for energy efficient mobile cloud computing. Limitations, such as poor processing ability and limited battery life, make it difficult for mobile devices to process complex computational tasks. The mobile devices in traditional local processing find it difficult to execute high-bandwidth-consuming videos, and solve this problem by offloading complex executions of the application onto cloud computing to minimise the processing requirements and energy consumption of the mobile device, thereby overcoming the limitations of poor processing ability and limited battery life of said mobile device. The energy efficient framework focuses on mobile cloud computing (MCC), which employs computational offloading for computationally intensive mobile applications on the mobile devices. An input device, namely, a virtual network computing (VNC) client, is installed on the local mobile device and connected to the VNC server, which is installed in the cloud. Energy consumption of the selected application is reduced up to 67.19% by computational offloading compared to traditional methods. The results were observed to be encouraging.
