AB Cloud computing offers sufficient computing and storage resources that can be used to provide multimedia services. Migrating the existing multimedia service to cloud brings a new challenging issue, i.e., remote display of video contents. To reduce the bandwidth consumption especially for mobile users, it is desired to encode video before sending to client. Existing encoding methods have unique advantages and disadvantages, differing their performance under varying situations. Thus, we propose to use multi-encoder method to solve the real-time remote display problem for remote multimedia cloud. To select the most appropriate encoder, factors including cost, application requirement, network, client device and codec implementation are considered. In this paper, we form a non-linear programming model, and provide an example to illustrate how to apply the proposed model for getting desired optimization.
