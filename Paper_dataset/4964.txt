AB Cloud computing is an elegance of computing system where immensely scalable Information Technology-enabled capabilities are conveyed 'as a service' using Computer and Internet technologies to numerous outdoor clients. DaaS that provides various research challenges in associations to data storage security and cost related issues from user's view. The various security concerns are data intrusion. scalability, non-repudiation, data integrity, confidentiality, heterogeneity. In cloud database information can be leaked due to various reasons. The proposed method provides three level security using AES algorithm and secure private key. The method also provides data storage privacy preservation of large organization and sensitive data storage leak detection. The experimental outcome represented that our method is better for public cloud database security.
