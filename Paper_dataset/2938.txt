AB The privacy and security issues of information message dissemination have been well researched in typical VANETs. However, cloud computing paradigm is merely utilized for secure information message dissemination over VANETs. In this paper, we propose a secure authentication framework for cloud-based toll payment message dissemination over ubiquitous VANETs, which primarily deal with two types of information messages that is general purpose and special purpose information messages. General purpose information messages include infotainment, traffic congestion, location-based services and emergency services. While the special purpose information messages include toll tax and revenue collection services. Moreover, our secure authentication framework (CCES-PKC) integrates the novel cloud-based pairing-free certificate-less encryption, secure authentication control, signature-based information encryption, decryption through cloud verification and signature authentication along with batch auditing. The certificate overhead management is passed over to the cloud infrastructure for fine-grained information message dissemination by enabling verification, integrity and confidentiality. Performance assessments including efficiency, security and experimental analysis emphasize that the proposed scheme is remarkably appropriate for secure toll payment information message dissemination.
