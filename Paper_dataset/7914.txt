AB The growth in computer and networking technologies over the past decades established cloud computing as a new paradigm in information technology. The cloud computing promises to deliver cost-effective services by running workloads in a large scale data center consisting of thousands of virtualized servers. The main challenge with a cloud platform is its unpredictable performance. A possible solution to this challenge could be load balancing mechanism that aims to distribute the workload across the servers of the data center effectively. In this paper, we present a distributed and scalable load balancing mechanism for cloud computing using game theory. The mechanism is self-organized and depends only on the local information for the load balancing. We proved that our mechanism converges and its inefficiency is bounded. Simulation results show that the generated placement of workload on servers provides an efficient, scalable, and reliable load balancing scheme for the cloud data center.
