AB Monitoring for cloud is the key technology to know the status and the availability of the resources and services present in the current infrastructure. However, cloud monitoring faces a lot of challenges due to inefficient monitoring capability and enormous resource consumption. We study the adaptive monitoring for cloud computing platform, and focus on the problem of balancing monitoring capability and resource consumption. We proposed HSACMA, a hierarchical scalable adaptive monitoring architecture, that (1) monitors the physical and virtual infrastructure at the infrastructure layer, the middleware running at the platform layer, and the application services at the application layer; (2) achieves the scalability of the monitoring based on microservices; and (3) adaptively adjusts the monitoring interval and data transmission strategy according to the running state of the cloud computing system. Moreover, we study a case of real production system deployed and running on the cloud computing platform called CloudStack, to verify the effectiveness of applying our architecture in practice. The results show that HSACMA can guarantee the accuracy and real-time performance of monitoring and reduces resource consumption.
