DE Data center; cloud computing; performance and energy efficiency metrics
AB Cloud computing has become a de facto approach for service provisioning over the Internet. It operates relying on a pool of shared computing resources available on demand and usually hosted in data centers. Assessing performance and energy efficiency of data centers becomes fundamental. Industries use a number of metrics to assess efficiency and energy consumption of cloud computing systems, focusing mainly on the efficiency of IT equipment, cooling and power distribution systems. However, none of the existing metrics is precise enough to distinguish and analyze the performance of data center communication systems from IT equipment. This paper proposes a framework of new metrics able to assess performance and energy efficiency of cloud computing communication systems, processes and protocols. The proposed metrics have been evaluated for the most common data center architectures including fat tree three-tier, BCube, DCell and Hypercube.
