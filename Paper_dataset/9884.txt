ID ALLOCATION
AB The submission of tasks to a data center plays a crucial role to achieve the services like scheduling, processing in a cloud computing environment. Energy consumption of a data center must be considered for task processing as it results in high operational expenditures and bad environmental impact. Unfortunately, none of the current research works focus on energy factor while submitting tasks to a cloud. In this paper a framework is proposed to select a data center with minimum energy consumption. The service provider has to register all the data centers in a registry. The energy consumed by task processing using virtualization and energy of IT equipments like routers, switches is calculated. The data center selection framework finally selects the data center with minimum energy consumption for task processing. The experimental results indicate that the proposed idea results in a less energy when compared to the existing algorithms for selection of data centers.
