AB The demand for satisfying service requests, effectively allocating computing resources, and providing service on-demand application continuously increases along with the rapid development of the Internet. Edge computing is used to satisfy the low latency, network connection, and local data processing requirements and to alleviate the workload in the cloud. This paper proposes a gateway-based edge computing service model to reduce the latency of data transmission and the network bandwidth from and to the cloud. An on-demand computing resource allocation can be achieved by adjusting the task schedule of the edge gateway via the lightweight virtualization technology, Docker. The edge gateway can also process the service requests in the local network. The proposed edge computing servicemodel not only eliminates the computation burden of the traditional cloud servicemodel but also improves the operation efficiency of the edge computing nodes. This model can also be used for various innovation applications in the cloud-edge computing environment for 5G and beyond.
