AB Nowadays the access to a cloud computing environment is provided on-demand offering transparent services to customers. Although the cloud allows an abstraction of the behavior of the service providers in the infrastructure (involving logical and physical resources), it remains a challenge to fully comply with the Service Level Agreements (SLAs), because, depending on the service demand and system configuration, the providers may not be able to meet the requirements of the customers. There is a need for mechanisms that take account of load balancing algorithms to provide an efficient load distribution with the available resources. However, the studies in the literature do not effectively address the problem of the availability of resources to meet customers' requirements with analysis restricted to a limited set of objectives. This paper proposes algorithms to address the need for optimization when handling computational resources during the execution time. The methods optimize the efficient use of the resources available in the infrastructure aiming to comply with the service level agreements defined between client and provider.
