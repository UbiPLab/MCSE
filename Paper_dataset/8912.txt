AB While enjoying the convenience brought by various kinds of IoT devices, our private data are leaked. Smartphones, as the typical pivot of IoT devices, use various kinds of apps, which collect our private data. In fact, private data leakage, as a potential hazard, is caused by the current design trend in industry, which is bigger and bigger. However, few people notice the side-effect, while we seem never bored by pursuing "smart" devices. In this article, we introduce the behaviors of data collection, and illustrate the motivations and reasons behind them. Thankfully, cloud computing with sufficient resources and exquisite services is a perfect way out. We introduce a mobile-cloud framework to provide fine-grained permission authorization service for IoT devices, and show its performance by experimental results. Nevertheless, there are still lots of issues to be solved for the perfect IoT-cloud architecture. We list and analyze some obstacles and trends in the field of IoT-cloud.
