AB In this paper, we use modern education concept and satisfaction theory to study the construction of a system used to evaluate Japanese teaching quality based on a satisfaction model. We use a cloud computing platform to mine the rules of Japanese teaching quality satisfaction by using an improved Apriori algorithm to explore the impact of measurement indicators of teaching objectives, processes and results on overall satisfaction with Japanese teaching practices, so as to improve Japanese teaching in the future. Scientific decision-making, improvement of teaching practices, transformation and innovation of students' learning methods provide data reference and theoretical support.
