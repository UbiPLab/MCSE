AB Along with modern wireless networks being content-centric, the demand for rich multimedia services has been growing at a tremendous pace, which brings significant challenges to mobile networks in terms of the need for massive content delivery. Edge caching has emerged as a promising approach to alleviate the heavy burden on data transmission through caching and forwarding contents at the edge of networks. However, existing studies always treat storage and computing resources separately, and neglect the mobility characteristic of both the content caching nodes and end users. Driven by these issues, in this work, we propose a new cooperative edge caching architecture for 5G networks, where mobile edge computing resources are utilized for enhancing edge caching capability. In the architecture, we focus on mobility-aware hierarchical caching, where smart vehicles are taken as collaborative caching agents for sharing content cache tasks with base stations. To further utilize the caching resource of smart vehicles, we introduce a new vehicular caching cloud concept, and propose a vehicle-aided edge caching scheme, where the caching and computing resources at the wireless network edge are jointly scheduled. Numerical results indicate that the proposed scheme minimizes content access latency and improves caching resource utilization.
