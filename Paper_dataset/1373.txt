AB The trajectory data of taxies is an important kind of traffic data. Many traffic applications need to perform processing and analysis on trajectory data. Visualising trajectory data of vehicles on road maps is an important measure of reflecting and demonstrating the trend of traffic variation, where map matching from trajectory data to road network plays the most crucial role in such a visualisation process. We design and implement a novel interactive visualised map matching system in this paper, namely MMatchingVis, which provides multiple front-end functions including road selection, data extraction, map matching algorithm selection and result display, based on web techniques and Baidu Map. MMatchingVis employs the JStorm platform for trajectory data processing. We evaluate MMatchingVis' map matching results with the trajectory dataset collected from 6,599 taxies in Kunming, and evaluation results show that MMatchingVis could efficiently process and analyse trajectory data, support multiple user interaction models, and provide fine-grained visualisation presentation.
