AB The rapid development of big data and cloud computing technologies greatly accelerate the spreading and utilization of images and videos. The copyright protection for images and videos is becoming increasingly serious. In this paper, we proposed the robust non-blind watermarking schemes in YCbCr color space based on channel coding. The source watermark image is encoded and singular value decomposed. Subsequently, the singular value matrixes are embedded into the Y, Cb, and Cr components of the host image after four-level discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The embedding factor for each component is calculated based on the just-noticeable distortion and the singular vectors of HL subband of DWT. The peak signal-to-noise ratio of the watermarked image and the normalized correlation coefficient of the extracted watermark are investigated. It is shown that the proposed channel coding-based schemes can achieve near exact watermark recovery against all kinds of attacks. Considering both robustness and transparency, the convolutional code-based additive embedding scheme is optimal, which can also achieve good performance for video watermarking after extension.
