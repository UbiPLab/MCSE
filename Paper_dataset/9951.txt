AB The rapid growth of emerging applications and the evolution of cloud computing technologies have significantly enhanced the capability to generate vast amounts of data. Thus, it has become a great challenge in this big data era to manage such voluminous amount of data. The recent advancements in big data techniques and technologies have enabled many enterprises to handle big data efficiently. However, these advances in techniques and technologies have not yet been studied in detail and a comprehensive survey of this domain is still lacking. With focus on big data management, this survey aims to investigate feasible techniques of managing big data by emphasizing on storage, pre-processing, processing and security. Moreover, the critical aspects of these techniques are analyzed by devising a taxonomy in order to identify the problems and proposals made to alleviate these problems. Furthermore, big data management techniques are also summarized. Finally, several future research directions are presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
