AB Data outsourcing into the third party cloud server has been radically increasing with the expanding popularity of cloud computing. Recently, researchers are more attentive on privacy preserved secure outsourced data access control due to data sensibility, gradually growth of data in size, dynamic nature of data user, accessing the data in lightweight device etc. Dynamic and efficient revocable data access control using attribute based encryption (ABE) is most prominent technology for such situation. In this article, we are concentrating to summarize several existing approaches to identify the current scenario of outsourced data access control in cloud with respect to security, privacy and efficient revocation. We are also concern about significant analysis of numerous advanced technologies to achieve dynamic and efficient revocable outsourced data access control for further research with respect to reliability, scalability and efficiency. We have presented here a comprehensive study and analysis of several functionalities of ABE, revocation and privacy preservation.
