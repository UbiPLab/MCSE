AB Resource management is a hotspot issue in distributed systems like cloud computing (CC). It means how to prepare the computational resources, i.e., servers and virtual machines (VMS), to execute the tasks. This paper offers a new approach based on Group Technology (GT)-known as a powerful philosophy for the resource management in cellular manufacturing systems-to deal with the resource management problem in CC. We develop a mathematical model to optimally consolidate the VMs, servers and tasks simultaneously to control several important factors such as task migrations and server load variation, as well as the number of VMs. To test the validity of our proposed model, several small problems are generated randomly and solved by LINGO 9 software. Furthermore, to cope with larger problems, which cannot be solved optimally, a genetic algorithm is proposed. We, finally, compare our methods with the most well-known algorithms in this context, round robin (RR) and first-come, first-served (FCFS) algorithms.
