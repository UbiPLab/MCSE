AB Energy consumption is a very important issue that has attracted the attention of many cloud providers as it takes a large quotient of the operation cost for cloud data center. To decrease the energy consumption in cloud data center, one possible solution is to process different types of applications with different strategies. To reach this goal, it is important to know the type of application before it be dealt with. In this paper, we present an application type classification method by monitoring the usage of the resources of application. Through analysis, we find that only part of the parameters are much related to different types of applications. Using these parameters we put forward a feature model that can effectively classify the types of different applications. Extensive experiments show that the model put forward can effectively and accurately classify CPU intensive application, I/O intensive application and network intensive application. It can be used as the basis of efficient utilization of the cloud resources.
