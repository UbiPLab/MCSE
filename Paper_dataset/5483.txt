AB Clouds are shareable scientific instruments that create the potential for reproducibility by ensuring that all investigators have access to a common execution platform on which computational experiments can be repeated and compared. By virtue of the interface they present, they also lead to the creation of digital artifacts compatible with the cloud, such as images or orchestration templates, that go a long way-and sometimes all the way-to representing an experiment in a digital, repeatable form. In this article, I describe how we developed these natural advantages of clouds in the Chameleon testbed and argue that we should leverage them to create a digital research marketplace that would make repeating experiments as natural and viable part of research as sharing ideas via reading papers is today.
