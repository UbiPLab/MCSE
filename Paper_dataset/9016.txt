AB The modern enterprise is in need of a business transformation to keep up with the rapid evolution of cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), mobile communications, and other digital technologies. The era has arrived in which a competitor may be a company in a completely different industry or a startup company (which was previously inconceivable). In such an era, growth is difficult to achieve by simply continuing one's traditional business, and predicting the future is nearly impossible. Change is required for growth. There is thus a need for enterprise systems that can forecast the future using information and communications technology (ICT), perform testing quickly and repeatedly, and react flexibly to change. To meet this need, Fujitsu launched the FUJITSU Cloud Service KS Platform as a Service (PaaS) on April 1, 2016. It supports the development, execution, and operation of the business applications that lie at the core of an enterprise business. It combines years of system integration knowledge with open technologies and is aimed at improving the ability of business applications to respond to change. In particular, it enables enterprises to create new businesses by connecting a variety of service functions such as IoT and social media. This paper describes the features of KS PaaS, the requirements for quickly and flexibly contributing to the digitalization of customers' businesses, and service functions for meeting those requirements.
