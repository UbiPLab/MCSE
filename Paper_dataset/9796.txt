AB Cloud computing is a new style of computing in which dynamically scalable and reconfigurable resources are provided as a service over the internet. The MapReduce framework is currently the most dominant programming model in cloud computing. It is necessary to protect the integrity of MapReduce data processing services. Malicious workers, who can be divided into collusive workers and non-collusive workers, try to generate bad results in order to attack the cloud computing. So, figuring out how to efficiently detect the malicious workers has been very important, as existing solutions are not effective enough in defeating malicious behavior. In this paper, we propose a security protection framework to detect the malicious workers and ensure computation integrity in the map phase of MapReduce. Our simulation results show that our proposed security protection framework can efficiently detect both collusive and non-collusive workers and guarantee high computation accuracy.
