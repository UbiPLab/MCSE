AB Network load is one of the major shortcomings of cloud computing environment. Sometimes, many light and heavy weighted processes hamper the speed of the network. To avoid the load of cloud network, we need to have a mechanism in which parallel execution of processes will occur so that the scheduling will be much more efficient and thus, throughput will increase. Network load can be minimized. For this, we are going to propose a new concept "Parallelism in CPU virtualization and scheduling using Cuckoo Search Algorithm" in which the processes will be allocated to the resources for their execution depending on the availability of efficiency of those resources. If any resource can accept many processes, then that resource can be allocated for the execution of those processes at the same time. Thus, resources can be utilized absolutely and this leads to parallelism in CPU virtualization and many processes can be served at any instance of time, throughput is maximized. At the same time, processes do not starve for a long time and resource utilization will be maximized.
