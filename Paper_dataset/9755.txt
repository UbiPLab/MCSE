AB Recently, the video data has very huge volume, taking one city for example, thousands of cameras are built of which each collects high-definition video over 24-48 GB every day with the rapidly growth; secondly, data collected includes variety of formats involving multimedia, images and other unstructured data; furthermore the valuable information contains in only a few frames called key frames of massive video data; and the last problem caused is how to improve the processing velocity of a large amount of original video with computers, so as to enhance the crime prediction and detection effectiveness of police and users. In this paper, we conclude a novel architecture for next generation public security system, and the "front + back" pattern is adopted to address the problems brought by the redundant construction of current public security information systems which realizes the resource consolidation of multiple IT resources, and provides unified computing and storage environment for more complex data analysis and applications such as data mining and semantic reasoning. Under the architecture, we introduce cloud computing technologies such as distributed storage and computing, data retrieval of huge and heterogeneous data, provide multiple optimized strategies to enhance the utilization of resources and efficiency of tasks. This paper also presents a novel strategy to generate a super-resolution image via multi-stage dictionaries which are trained by a cascade training process. Extensive experiments on image super-resolution validate that the proposed solution can get much better results than some state-of-the-arts ones.
