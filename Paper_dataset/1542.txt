ID SCHEME
AB The face recognition has become a common means of identity authentication because of the advantages of uniqueness, non-invasive and not easy to be stolen. The outsourcing of face recognition to the service provider is a typical manner nowadays. However, it raises vital concerns about the privacy of outsourcing server due to the sensitivity of face data. Therefore, a frame of identity authentication based on the technology of privacy-preserving face recognition is presented in this paper. The convolutional neural network is used for face feature extraction. To overcome the issue of privacy leaked, a method of secure nearest neighbor that can compute the cosine similarity over encrypted feature vectors is proposed. What's more, the edge computing is introduced in our frame to increase the authentication efficiency by removing some operations from the cloud to the edge of the Internet. Moreover, we also propose a secret sharing homomorphism technology which is used for distributed computing to improve the fault-tolerance of our identity authentication system. The experimental results show that the proposed schemes are secure and effective.
