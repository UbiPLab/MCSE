AB Cloud computing is one of the fastest growing and popular computer technologies, and there are more and more enterprise services based on the cloud computing. In order to save costs, more and more enterprises and their employees have hired the enterprise cloud services, and put much important information in the cloud gradually. Cloud service systems have become the main targets of malicious attacks. However, the cloud computing technologies are still not perfect, and the management and maintenance of enterprise cloud services are more complex compared to traditional network services of cloud computing. So, enterprise cloud services are more likely to encounter some security problems, and the influenced scale of these security problems is broad. But there are few researches on the security of enterprise cloud services. In this paper, we analyze the software as a service (SaaS) enterprise cloud services and introduce the research status of security problems in cloud computing environment. Combining with the analysis of the characteristics and application architecture of SaaS enterprise cloud services, we propose the security problems analysis model, the analysis system architecture and the relational model. Our researches can support further research of the automatic generation of solutions and guide the deployment of security policies of SaaS enterprise cloud services.
