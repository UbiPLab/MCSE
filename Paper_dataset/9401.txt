AB Cloud computing delivers on-demand resources over the Internet on a pay-for-use basis, intruders may exploit clouds for their advantage. This paper presents Autonomous Cloud Intrusion Response System (ACIRS), a proper defense strategy for cloud systems. ACIRS continuously monitors and analyzes system events and computes security and risk parameters to provide risk assessment and mitigation capabilities with a scalable and elastic architecture with no central coordinator. It detects masquerade, host based and network based attacks and selects the appropriate response to mitigate these attacks. ACIRS is superior to NICE (Network Intrusion Detection and Countermeasure Selection system) in reducing the risk by 38 %. This paper describes the components, architecture, and advantages of ACIRS.
