AB The combination of two overlapping technologies (bigdata and cloud computing) helps easy access to the evolving applications. In this context, there is a serious requirement of ensuring the transmission of data securely in order to improve the productivity over the public channel. Since the data collected by various sources are strictly private and confidential, there is also a great requirement to deal with the privacy preservation of the bigdata. To handle this issue, a new privacy-preserving bigdata collection technique in cloud computing environment, called 2PBDC, has been designed, which allows secure communication between the bigdata gateway nodes and the cloud servers. 2PBDC is shown to be secure against various known attacks against an active/passive adversary through the formal security verification as well as informal security analysis. A detailed comparative study among 2PBDC and other existing schemes has been conducted. This study shows that 2PBDC offers a better trade-off among the security and functionality features and communication and computation overheads while these are compared with other schemes.
