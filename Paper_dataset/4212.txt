AB Offloading computation from mobile to remote cloud servers is a promising way to reduce energy consumption and improve the performance of mobile applications. However, a great challenge arises as automatic integration of powerful computing resources in remote cloud infrastructure and the portability of mobile devices. In this paper, we develop a Java annotation-based offloading framework, called MCAF, for android mobile devices. This framework is designed and committed to simplifying the development of android applications enabled with the offload capability. All the developers need to do is to import the SDK library of our MCAF and annotate the computation-intensive methods. MCAF can automatically extract the annotated source code and generate the code that will be run in the Cloud. Moreover, the codes of making the offloading decisions are automatically inserted into the original source code. We also conducted the real experiments to show the applicability of our MCAF.
