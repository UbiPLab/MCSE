AB Mobile Cloud Computing has become a promising computing platform. It moves users' data to the centralized large data centers for users' mobile devices to conveniently access. Since the data storage service may not be fully trusted, many public verification algorithms are proposed to check the data integrity. However, these algorithms hardly consider the huge computational burden for the verifiers with resource-constrained mobile devices to execute the verification tasks. We propose an energy-efficient algorithm for assigning verification tasks (EEAVT) to optimize the energy consumption and assign the verification tasks by elastic and customizable ways. The algorithm prioritizes verification tasks according to the expected finish time of the verification, and assigns the number of checked blocks referring to devices' residual energy and available operation time. Theoretical analysis and experiment evaluation show that our algorithm not only shortens the verification finish time, but also decreases energy consumption, thus improving the efficiency and reliability of the verification.
