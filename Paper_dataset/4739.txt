AB Green computing has become a hot issue for both academia and industry. The fifthgeneration (5G) mobile networks put forward a high request for energy efficiency and low latency. The cloud radio access network provides efficient resource use, high performance, and high availability for 5G systems. However, hardware and software faults of cloud systems may lead to failure in providing real-time services. Developing fault tolerance technique can efficiently enhance the reliability and availability of real-time cloud services. The core idea of fault-tolerant scheduling algorithm is introducing redundancy to ensure that the tasks can be finished in the case of permanent or transient system failure. Nevertheless, the redundancy incurs extra overhead for cloud systems, which results in considerable energy consumption. In this paper, we focus on the problem of how to reduce the energy consumption when providing fault tolerance. We first propose a novel primary-backup-based fault-tolerant scheduling architecture for real-time tasks in the cloud environment. Based on the architecture, we present an energy-efficient fault-tolerant scheduling algorithm for real-time tasks (EFTR). EFTR adopts a proactive strategy to increase the system processing capacity and employs a rearrangement mechanism to improve the resource utilization. Simulation experiments are conducted on the CloudSim platform to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of EFTR. Compared with the existing fault-tolerant scheduling algorithms, EFTR shows excellent performance in energy conservation and task schedulability.
