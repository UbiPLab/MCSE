AB Outsourcing spatial database to a third party is becoming a common practice for more and more individuals and companies to save the cost of managing and maintaining database, where a data owner delegates its spatial data management tasks to a third party and grants it to provide query services. However, the third party is not full trusted. Thus, authentication information should be provided to the client for query authentication. In this paper, we introduce an efficient space authenticated data structure, called Verifiable Similarity Indexing tree (VSS-tree), to support authenticated spatial query. We build VSS-tree based on SS-tree which employs bounding sphere rather than bounding rectangle for region shape and extend it with authentication information. Based on VSS-tree, the third party finds query results and builds their corresponding verification object. The client performs query authentication using the verification object and the public key published. Finally, we evaluate the performance and validity of our algorithms, the experiment results show that VSS-tree can efficiently support spatial query and have better performance than Merkle R tree (MR-tree).
