AB Fog computing extends cloud-based computing concept to the edge of the network, thus enabling a breed of services and applications. Previous research topics on fog computing have significantly focused on the concepts and fundamentals of fog computing and its importance in the context of Internet of things (IoT) and Web of object (WoO). Recently, inspired by IoT and WoO, the era of connecting all the things and people is coming. Unfortunately, various devices and objects in IoT environments hardly show the method for automatic connection and the cooperation applied to IoT applications and services. Firstly, in this paper we propose WoO based on the architecture which contains various devices and objects for providing Web base IoT services and applications. Secondly, various service overlay network concepts for providing mashup by service federation and composition are introduced. Also, we describe service deployment architecture over smart home IoT architecture on fog computing environment. Thirdly, we propose a new architecture for selecting optimal objects or things attributed from the metadata, resource and profiles by our WoO-based smart building energy prediction methodology.
