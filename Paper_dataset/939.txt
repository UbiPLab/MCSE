AB Dynamic Replica Technology can solve the problem of load balancing in cloud computing. Multiple replicas are distributed in different nodes and the load of a node can be dispersed to other nodes that have the replicas. This paper presents a replica manage strategy based on file access frequency to solve the problem of load balancing, including the time for creating the replicas, the number of the replicas, the location of the replicas, the time for deleting the replicas and deleting the replicas. The strategy determines the number and the location of replicas according to the file access frequency, node's storage space, network bandwidth, replica consistency maintenance cost and other factors. The replica will be deleted when the file access frequency is low or it has not been accessed for a long time. Experimental results reveal that the algorithm can not only achieve load balancing but also improve the performance of the system.
