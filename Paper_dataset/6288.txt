AB In a Smart City is required computational platforms, which allow environments with multiple interconnected and embedded systems, where the technology is integrated with the people, and can respond to unpredictable situations. One of the biggest challenges in developing Smart City is how to describe and dispose of enormous and multiple sources of information, and how to share and merge it into a single infrastructure. In previous works, we have proposed an Autonomic Reflective Middleware with emerging and ubiquitous capabilities, which is based on intelligent agents that can be adapted to the existing dynamism in a city for, ubiquitously, respond to the requirements of citizens, using emerging ontologies that allow the adaptation to the context. In this work, we extend this middleware using the fog computing paradigm, to solve this problem. The fog extends the cloud to be closer to the things that produce and act on the smart city. In this paper, we present the extension to the middleware, and examples of utilization in different situations in a smart city.
