AB Cloud computing is a major technological trend that continues to evolve and flourish. With the advent of the cloud, high availability assurance of cloud service has become a critical issue for cloud service providers and customers. Several studies have considered the problem of cloud service availability modeling and analysis. However, the complexity of the cloud service provisioning system and the deep dependency stack of its layered architecture make it challenging to evaluate the availability of cloud services. In this paper, we propose a novel analytical model of cloud service provisioning systems availability. Further, we provide a detailed methodology for evaluating cloud service availability using series/parallel configurations and operational measures. The results of a case study using simulated cloud computing infrastructure illustrates the usability of the proposed model.
