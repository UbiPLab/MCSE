AB Cloud computing has become a business model and organizations like Google, Amazon, etc. are investing huge capital on it. The availability of many organizations in the cloud has posed a challenge for cloud users to choose a best cloud service. To assist the cloud users, we have proposed a MCDM-based cloud service selection framework to choose a best service provider based on QoS requirement. The cloud service selection methods based on TOPSIS suffers from rank reversal problem as it ranks optimal service provider to non-optimal on addition or removal of a service provider and deludes the cloud user. Therefore, a robust and efficient TOPSIS (RE-TOPSIS)-based novel framework has been proposed to rank the cloud service providers using QoS provided by them and cloud user's priority for each QoS. The proposed framework is robust to rank reversal problem and its effectiveness has been demonstrated through a case study performed on a real dataset. Sensitivity analysis has also been performed to show the robustness against the rank reversal phenomenon.
