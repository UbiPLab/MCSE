AB Organizations and governments leverage on the potentials in data to plan and compete globally. Data from various sources are continually mined, stored in databases and utilized in a manner that improves processes, products and ensure steady profitability. The traditional relational database management systems are unable to cope with these new forms of data. The velocity, volume and variety in which data are generated qualify them as "Big Data". This scales up the storage and processing needs of client organizations, allowing them to focus on their core areas of expertise. This paper investigates the relevance of aggregating big data and its efficient management in a cloud computing environment. It adopts the prototyping design and a case study approach, based on Couchbase Server, a non-structured query language document database and cloud computing platform. The accruable benefit of this work is organizational cost-effectiveness, timeliness in decision making and higher profitability.
