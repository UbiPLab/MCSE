AB This paper sets forth a cloud platform for implementing a completely integrated system for healthcare that fulfils identified field specific requirements. To achieve a high level of performance at a low cost, the paper presents an analytical model for cloud computing scheduling. The proposed model takes into consideration classification based on message priority, separation of classification and processing from the message output servers, and random load of the incoming requests. Performance is measured in terms of the number of requests, waiting time, response time, and requests drop rate for each priority class defined. Experimental results indicate that proposed model is able to support a great number of arrival requests providing short response time related to priority classes.
