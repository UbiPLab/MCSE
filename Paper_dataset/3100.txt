AB Multimedia data sharing services are attracting more and more attention. Advanced cloud computing technology provides huge storage and efficient support for multimedia big data services. Multimedia cloud services become a mainly development trend. In this paper, a high-capacity and lossless reversible data hiding scheme is proposed for encrypted multimedia data in cloud computing. The proposed scheme not only ensures multimedia data security without relying on the trustworthiness of cloud servers, but also transmits additional data in encryption domain by combining re-encryption and reversible data hiding techniques. Theoretical analysis confirms the correctness of the proposed encryption model and justifies the security of the proposed scheme. The computation cost of the proposed scheme is acceptable and adjusts to different security levels. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can perform better than existing methods.
