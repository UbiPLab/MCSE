AB The discipline of enterprise application integration (EAI) enables the decoupled communication between (business) applications, and thus became a cornerstone of today's IT architectures. In 2004, the book by Hohpe and Woolf on Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) provided a fundamental collection of messaging patterns, denoting the building blocks of many EAI system implementations. Since then, multiple new trends and a broad range of new application scenarios have emerged, e.g., cloud and mobile computing, multimedia streams. These developments ultimately lead to conceptual changes and challenges such as larger data volumes (i.e., message sizes), a growing number of messages (i.e., velocity) and communication partners, and even more diverse message formats (i.e., variety). However, the research since 2004 focused on isolated EAI solutions, and thus a broader and integrated analysis of solutions and new patterns is missing. In this survey, we summarize new trends and application scenarios which serve as a frame to structure our survey of academic research on EIP, existing systems for EAI and also to classify integration patterns from these sources. We evaluate recently developed integration solutions and patterns in the context of real-world integration scenarios. Finally, we derive and summarize remaining challenges and open research questions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
