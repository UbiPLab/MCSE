AB With the rapid growth of the mobile devices and the emergence of cloud computing, mobile cloud computing has gained widespread interest. In mobile cloud computing, a large-scale collection of mobile devices cooperate with each other to provide a cloud service at the edge. However, the improper mobile device selection has a negative effect on the quality of service. Existing methods are difficult to solve the problem, because they do not take the status and the historical characteristics of the mobile devices into consideration. This paper introduces a device status-aware and stability-aware mobile device selection method. Firstly, a model is designed to store the status and the historical characteristics of each mobile device. Secondly, an optimized cloud model is employed to evaluate the stability of each mobile device. Lastly, an optimal mobile device searching algorithm is presented to select the optimal mobile device. We provide an extensive evaluation of our method. The results show that our method can increase the quality of mobile cloud service compared with the traditional method.
