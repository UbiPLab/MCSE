ID SYSTEM
AB The main focus of this study was to remotely monitor the generation of thin film coatings and analyse the electrical conditions to be controlled, such as current, voltage, and resistance, during the generation of thin film coatings. An Android-based real-time monitoring mobile application is developed to facilitate long-distance unmanned monitoring. Information is stored and transmitted in the cloud database by a monitoring platform, as based on a wireless sensor network, or alternatively by a wired network, telecom network, or Wi-Fi connection on a mobile phone. A communication coupler is used to control two direct current power supply devices with a novel signal processing technology. As such, this system could exhibit stable results, record the changing values of the pulse generator, and store the data during the generation of thin film coatings. In this design, as the values of the production parameters are modifiable in real time, it was unnecessary for personnel to monitor the machine, and nodes were used for mobile computing. This thin film coating system features the advantages of ease-of-development, strong fault tolerance, and energy conservation.
