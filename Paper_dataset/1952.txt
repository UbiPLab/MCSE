AB Recently, cloud computing has become popular for smart societies because it made dynamical network without building a physical network. Despite recent research on the cloud, it is necessary to study security functions for the identification of fake VNFs and the encryption of communication between entities. Also, the VNFs can not only be attacked, but also perform malicious behavior such as botnets to disable user service. In this paper, we propose a lightweight PKI mechanism that detects the fake VNFs and guarantees data security through mutual authentication between VNFs. To evaluate the proposal, we built a MANO environment to test the performance of authentication and key generation for data security. In addition, we tested the performance of the detection for the DDoS attack by using real attack data. The LW_PKI guaranteed the reliability of a smart service by enhancing the security of the cloud environment.
