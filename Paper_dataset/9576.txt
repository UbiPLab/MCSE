AB The single-layer solutions using a four-stream discrete ordinates method (DOM) in infrared radiative transfer (IRT) have been obtained. Two types of thermal source assumptions-Planck function exponential and linear dependence on optical depth-are considered. To calculate the IRT in multiple layers with a vertically inhomogeneous atmosphere, an analytical adding algorithm has been developed by applying the infrared invariance principle. The derived adding algorithm of the delta-four-stream DOM(delta-4DDA) can be simplified to work for the delta-two-stream DOM (delta-2DDA).
   The accuracy for monochromatic emissivity is investigated for both delta-2DDA and delta-4DDA. The relative error for the downward emissivity can be as high as 15% for delta-2DDA, while the error is bounded by 2% for delta-4DDA. By incorporating delta-4DDA into a radiation model with gaseous transmission, delta-4DDA is much more accurate than delta-2DDA. Also, delta-4DDA is much more efficient, since it is an analytical method. The computing time of delta-4DDA is about one-third of the corresponding inverse matrix method.
