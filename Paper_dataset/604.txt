AB It is commonsense that the data should be encrypted by searchable encryption before being outsourced to the cloud for its confidentiality and availability. Most of existing studies focus on forward privacy, we initiate the study of forward unforgeability, which defines the time periods when files can be uploaded while the forward privacy defines the time periods when files can be queried. For example in log-files management, we should block the attackers from revising the logs of previous time periods. We find that forward unforgeability is helpful in dealing with the problem. However, it is still challenging to achieve forward unforgeability in case of searchable encryption. In this paper, we formalize the key exposure problem in keyword-field-free conjunctive keyword search (KFF-CKS) and define the forward unforgeability of KFF-CKS formally. Then we design a general framework where any forward unforgeable KFF-CKS scheme can be applied there for practical use. After that, we construct a novel KFF-CKS scheme with forward unforgeability (FU-KFF-CKS) under this framework. Furthermore, we formally prove the security properties of our FU-KFF-CKS under random oracle model and compare our construction with previous ones in a theoretical view. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and the results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed FU-KFF-CKS.
