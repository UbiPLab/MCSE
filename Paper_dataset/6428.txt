AB With the recent emergence of cloud computing, growing numbers of clients are using online cloud services through the Internet such as video streaming service. The rent costs of cloud service providers increase when the resource utilizations of the cloud-servers are not well. Therefore, resource allocation is a crucial problem for cloud data centers. The resource allocation problem is an NP-hard problem. This paper proposes a novel cloud resource allocation mechanism based on a winning strategy for a Nim game. This mechanism offers all clients an effective number of running cloud servers, and allocates cloud resources rapidly and effectively by using a pre-pairing approach. The proposed mechanism does not require searching for remaining resources of the running cloud server; hence, it can reduce the time taken to arrange resources. The experimental results show that the proposed mechanism can improve utilization of cloud servers and reduce the rent costs of the cloud service providers. The proposed mechanism can reach the utilization of cloud servers by as much as 99.96 %. The proposed mechanism is approximately 9 % more efficient than the market-based grid resource allocation algorithm, and 19 % more efficient than the modified best fit decreasing algorithm.
