AB The smart city model is used by many organizations for large cities around the world to significantly enhance and improve the quality of life of the inhabitants, improve the utilization of city resources, and reduce operational costs. This model includes various heterogeneous technologies such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), Cloud Computing, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, in order to reach these important objectives, efficient networking and communication protocols are needed to provide the necessary coordination and control of the various system components. In this paper, we identify the networking characteristics and requirements of smart city applications, and identify the networking protocols that can be used to support the various data traffic flows that are needed between the different components. In addition, we provide illustrations of networking architectures of selected smart city systems, which include smart grid, smart home energy management, smart water, UAV and commercial aircraft safety, and pipeline monitoring and control systems.
