AB In Cloud Computing environment, the allocation of virtual machines (VMs) to clients without taking into consideration the programs that they execute in their VMs could be a great threat to the entire cloud environment. Indeed the hypervisor cannot isolate the VMs totally and these machines have a lot of vulnerabilities that could be exploited then spread the attack in the other servers even if there is such an intrusion prevention or detection system. For this reason the process of monitoring the file that should be executed in an allocated VM is an important strategy to mitigate such a threat. The sandbox security mechanism is one of the solutions that are used in complex environment to isolate malicious or unknown files for execution than allow it thereafter to be used in a real context. In this paper, a Bayesian game theoretic approach is used in order to take into consideration the type of the client based on his previous activities to predict his actions and to determine in which case the monitoring process should be used. For this reason, we model the system as a Bayesian non-cooperative game firstly, then we resolve the game and finally we provide some numerical results to predict user's action and show the appropriate actions that should be taken by the administrator.
