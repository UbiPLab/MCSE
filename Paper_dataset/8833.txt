AB A cloud computing environment offers a simplified, centralized platform or resources for use when needed at a low cost. One of the key functionalities of this type of computing is to allocate the resources on an individual demand. However, with the expanding requirements of cloud user, the need of efficient resource allocation is also emerging. The main role of service provider is to effectively distribute and share the resources which otherwise would result into resource wastage. In addition to the user getting the appropriate service according to request, the cost of respective resource is also optimized. In order to surmount the mentioned shortcomings and perform optimized resource allocation, this research proposes a new Agent based Automated Service Composition (A2SC) algorithm comprising of request processing and automated service composition phases and is not only responsible for searching comprehensive services but also considers reducing the cost of virtual machines which are consumed by on-demand services only.
