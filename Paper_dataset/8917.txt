AB This article discusses prospects and challenges of software defined elastic optical networking for grid and cloud computing environments. We exploit OpenFlow-based unified network control and management for both intra-and inter-data-center networks embedded in the cloud. The intra-data-center network is a fiber-rich environment. Therefore, we assume a flattened optical switching architecture using arrayed waveguide grating routers with fixed spectrum grid. For the inter-data-center network, spectral resources are more precious between the distributed long-haul fiber connections. Therefore, we assume elastic optical networks with flexible grid to achieve high spectral efficiency. This article discusses the elasticity of the multi-data-center cloud computing environment, which includes both fixed-grid and flexible-grid optical networks, and introduces a unified, software defined network control plane based on OpenFlow technologies.
