AB The vivid and rapid development of the Internet motivates cloud-based intelligent information systems to be applied. Mobile e-commerce, as a new business model based on cloud computing in intelligent service, has become the mainstream of mobile applications. It not only provides efficient computation services for both trading parties, but also gives a secure and reliable data storage center. However, privacy and accountability have become one of users' crucial concerns in mobile e-commerce transactions. In this paper, we present a practical and efficient accountable mobile e-commerce scheme that is based on cloud platform to address the fundamental transaction requirement. We propose the concrete construction and demonstrate that the proposed scheme can provide effective security in the transaction process, and also give the practical deployment in cloud computing systems to provide the intelligent information services. We also give the performance analysis and show it is efficient and practical compared with related methods in terms of computation complexity and communication costs.
