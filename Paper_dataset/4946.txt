   storage resources classification
AB Cloud storage has become a widely accepted data storage model in recent years. With the development of cloud storage applications in various fields, cloud storage security issues have aroused people's special attention. In this paper, taking aim at ensuring data reliability and satisfying QoS requirements for different users, a method named hierarchical storage-based data disaster recovery strategy was proposed. Cloud computing fault tolerance model is constructed by grading the storage resources of cloud service providers according to the service level to meet the different QoS requirements of the cloud users. On this basis, some storage levels are classified to improve resource utilization. The correctness of the classification strategy is analyzed theoretically, finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated by emulation experiment. This paper has the theoretical and practical value to improve the overall experience of users.
