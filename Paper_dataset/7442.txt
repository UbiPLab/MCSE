AB A MapReduce programming model is proposed to process big data using Hadoop, one of the major cloud computing frameworks. With the increasing adoption of cloud computing, running a Hadoop framework on a virtualized cluster is a compelling approach to reducing costs and increasing efficiency. In this paper, we measure the performance of a virtualized network and analyze the impact of network performance on Hadoop workloads running on a virtualized cluster. Then, we propose a virtualized network I/O architecture as a novel optimization for a virtualized Hadoop cluster for a public/private cloud provider. The proposed network architecture combines traditional network configurations and achieves better performance for Hadoop workloads. We also show a better way to utilize the rack awareness feature of the Hadoop framework in the proposed computing environment. The evaluation demonstrates that the proposed network architecture and mechanisms improve performance by up to 4.1 times compared with a bridge network architecture. This novel architecture can even virtually match the performance of the expensive, hardware-based single root I/O virtualization network architecture.
