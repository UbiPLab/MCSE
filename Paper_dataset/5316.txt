AB Performance of the current battery management systems is limited by the on-board embedded systems as the number of battery cells increases in the large-scale lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery energy storage systems (BESSs). Moreover, an expensive supervisory control and data acquisition system is still required for maintenance of the large-scale BESSs. This paper proposes a new cloud-based battery condition monitoring and fault diagnosis platform for the large-scale Li-ion BESSs. The proposed cyber-physical platform incorporates the Internet of Things embedded in the battery modules and the cloud battery management platform. Multithreads of a condition monitoring algorithm and an outlier mining-based battery fault diagnosis algorithm are built in the cloud battery management platform (CBMP). The proposed cloud-based condition monitoring and fault diagnosis platform is validated by using a cyber-physical testbed and a computational cost analysis for the CBMP. Therefore, the proposed platform will support the on-board health monitoring and provide an intelligent and cost-effective maintenance of the large-scale Li-ion BESSs.
