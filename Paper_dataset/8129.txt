AB At present, the marine economy has become a new growth point in China's national economic growth. Using information management technology to develop and protect marine resources reasonably can promote the sustainable development of the marine economy. However, various departments related to marine affairs have different understandings of marine informatization management over the years, resulting in their work being independent with a low degree of information sharing. When establishing the information system, the lack of unified deployment and planning of resources, low use rate of the resources, low processing efficiency of the massive data, the difficulty in system maintenance, and the high cost of independent operation have all seriously affected the efficiency of marine information management. To solve that, this research analyzed marine informatization management based on the era of big data. Marine information sharing technology under big data are discussed. A framework for the sharing of ocean information planning is constructed. This article puts forward the idea of combining marine information technology with cloud computing and relevant suggestions, which provides beneficial references for marine information management.
