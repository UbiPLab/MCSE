AB A wireless body area network is a wireless network of wearable computing devices. BAN devices may be deployed inside or surface-mounted on the human body. WBAN tackles throughput, high query latency and energy consumption. In this paper, we proposed clique-based WBAN scheduling (CBWS) algorithm and cloud-based WBAN algorithm. First, the sensors are not active together at the same time it can be clustered into different groups to avoid interference. So colouring based technique is used to schedule all groups in a time slot. And these sensor data are provided to the database for user query processing. Then, a cloud-based technique is utilised to secure the stored information and optimise the real-time query processing is done to obtain energy minimisation and query latency. Also multi queue scheduling (MQS) algorithm is used. The experimental results minimal energy consumption, query latency and better throughput also provide secure powerful storage infrastructure in real-time environment.
