AB Cloud-based expert systems are highly emerging nowadays. However, the data owners and cloud service providers are not in the same trusted domain in practice. For the sake of data privacy, sensitive data usually has to be encrypted before outsourcing which makes effective cloud utilization a challenging task. Taking this concern into account, we propose a novel cloud-based approach to securely recognize human activities. A few schemes exist in the literature for secure recognition. However, they suffer from the problem of constrained data and are vulnerable to re-identification attack, where advanced deep learning models are used to predict an object's identity. We address these problems by considering color and depth data, and securing them using position based superpixel transformation. The proposed transformation is designed by actively involving additional noise while resizing the underlying image. Due to this, a higher degree of obfuscation is achieved. Further, in spite of securing the complete video, we secure only four images, that is, one motion history image and three depth motion maps which are highly saving the data overhead. The recognition is performed using a four stream deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), where each stream is based on pre-trained MobileNet architecture. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is the best suitable candidate in "security-recognition accuracy (%)" trade-off relation among other image obfuscation as well as state-of-the-art schemes. Moreover, a number of security tests and analyses demonstrate robustness of the proposed approach. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
