AB Load balancing, reliability, and traffic are among the service-oriented issues in software engineering, and cloud computing is no exception to this rule and has put many challenges ahead of experts in this field. Considering the importance of the load balancing process in cloud computing, the purpose of this paper is to provide an appropriate solution for load balancing load in complex cloud systems using an adaptive fuzzy neural system. This system consists of four layers, and a particular operation is performed on each layer. The results of the experiments show that the system has better performance in the criteria mentioned above (balancing, traffic and reliability).
