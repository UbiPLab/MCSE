AB Aiming at establishing a shared storage environment, cloud storage systems are typical applications of cloud computing. Therefore, data replication technology has become a key research issue in storage systems. Considering the performance of data access and balancing the relationship between replica consistency maintenance costs and the performance of multiple replicas access, the methods of replica catalog design and the information acquisition method are proposed. Moreover, the deputy catalog acquisition method to design and copy the information is given. Then, the nodes with the global replica of the information replicate data resources, which have the high access frequency and the long response time. Afterwards, the Markov chain model is constructed. And a matrix geometric solution is used to export the steady-state solution of the model. The performance parameters in terms of the average response time, finish time, and the replica frequency are given to optimize the number of replicas in the storage system. Finally, numerical results with analysis are proposed to demonstrate the influence of the above parameters on the system performance.
