AB With the increased cloud computing and digital information storage, the energy requirement of data centers keeps increasing. A high-voltage point of load (HV POL) with an input series output parallel structure is proposed to convert 400 to 1 V-DC within a single stage to increase the power conversion efficiency. The symmetrical controlled half-bridge current doubler is selected as the converter topology in the HV POL. A load-dependent soft-switching method has been proposed with an auxiliary circuit that includes inductor, diode, and MOSFETs so that the hard-switching issue of typical symmetrical controlled half-bridge converters is resolved. The operation principles of the proposed soft-switching half-bridge current doubler have been analyzed in detail. Then, the necessity of adjusting the timing with the loading in the proposed method is analyzed based on losses, and a controller is designed to realize the load-dependent operation. A lossless RCD current sensing method is used to sense the output inductor current value in the proposed load-dependent operation. Experimental efficiency of a hardware prototype is provided to show that the proposed method can increase the converter's efficiency in both heavy-and light-load conditions.
