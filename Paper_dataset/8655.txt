AB Mobile cloud computing (MCC) has been introduced as an optimal solution to the constrained mobile devices. MCC takes mobile devices to a wholly new level where the latter rely on the cloud to store and process data. Since mobile cloud applications (MC- Apps) encompass more complicated features, they are considered as the next generation of mobile applications. Thereby new challenges arise in their development phase, such as exploiting the concept of mobility and contextual information. This new kind of applications requires new methods, of development, modelling and simulation. Addressing this lack in MCC, we propose in this paper a context-aware-based framework that allows: the description of MC-Apps' architecture with Mobile Cloud Architecture Description Language (MC-ADL); the simulation of MC-Apps' behaviour using mobile cloud simulation toolkit (MC-SIM); and the provision of a context-aware middleware: smart cloud gate (SCG) to ensure contextual configuration of the MC-Apps, and contextual evolution of its architecture.
