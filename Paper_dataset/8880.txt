AB The mobile industry's evolution from 4G to 5G will lead to a deep progress on mobile applications that are widely used in some new environments, such as vehicular social networks (VSNs). In VSNs, which are considered the first automobile social networks, vehicular communication can facilitate large-scale data sharing between drivers and their neighbours. However, malicious users of VSNs can also disseminate false information over the network. Traditional public key infrastructure (PKI) cannot recognize these malicious users, as they all have authorized identities. Thus, a trust management mechanism is introduced to secure vehicular social data. This paper demonstrates a high-level trust management model and its deployment scheme based on a vehicular cloud system. We propose a layered trust management mechanism that benefits from efficient use of physical resources (e.g., computing, storage, communication cost) and explore its deployment in a VSN scenario based on a three-layer cloud computing architecture. Moreover, performance modeling of the proposed trust management scheme is conducted through a novel formal compositional approach Performance Evaluation Process Algebra (PEPA). PEPA has superior features in compositionality and parsimony, which means that it can efficiently model systems with layered architectures and complex behaviours. PEPA also supports various numerical analyses through calculating its underlying continuous time Markov chains (CTMCs) directly or solving a set of approximated ordinary differential equations (ODEs). According to analysis outcomes, we analyzed several key performance properties of the scheme and related capacity issues in deployment. The findings also reveal an efficient investigation approach for evaluating the performances of trust models.
