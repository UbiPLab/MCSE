AB Clouds provide the abstraction of nearly-unlimited computing resources through the elastic use of federated resource pools (virtualized datacenters). They are being increasingly considered for HPC applications, which have traditionally targeted grids and supercomputing clusters. However, maximizing energy efficiency and utilization of cloud datacenter resources, avoiding undesired thermal hotspots (due to overheating of over-utilized computing equipment), and ensuring quality of service guarantees for HPC applications are all conflicting objectives, which require joint consideration of multiple pairwise tradeoffs. An innovative proactive thermal-aware virtual machine consolidation (involving allocations as well as migrations) technique is proposed to maximize computing resource utilization, to minimize datacenter energy consumption for computing, and to improve the efficiency of heat extraction. The capability to migrate virtual machines away from lightly-loaded servers in a thermal-aware manner opens up opportunity to improve resource consolidation over time and, hence, achieve the aforementioned goals. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is verified through experimental evaluations with HPC workload traces under single-as well as federated-datacenter scenarios.
