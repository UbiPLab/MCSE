AB In order to develop a new convenient online monitoring system for Internet of things, an online monitoring system based on cloud computing is designed. The performance of this new Internet of things technology used in modern agricultural is test by Amazon relational database service (RDS) and ZigBee perception network. By analyzing the Internet of things related technologies and agricultural modernization, the integration framework of the Internet of things, cloud computing and data mining technology in the field of modern agriculture are proposed. Through the modern agricultural Internet of things monitoring system, the Internet of things intelligent gateway, cloud based research and construction of large data analysis and data mining projects are verified. The experimental results show that the relevant parameters of the model are obtained by training about 70% of the original data after adopting the cloud computing. Based on the above finding, it is concluded that the open Internet of things platform needs to be supported by the powerful computing resources. In addition, the cloud computing technology is suitable for the development of the Internet of things service platform.
