AB Recently, excellent by Internet of Things (IoT), the era of connected everything device is coming. However, the devices hardly show the manner to autonomous connectivity on it and the self-cooperation for applied to real-world environments. In this paper, we proposed a smart building on IoT and cloud-based technology that can perform collaboration and efficient operation with various sensing devices in building and facilities. The smart building is very important to reduce on a huge amount of building energy is consumed by the management system of buildings. The proposed system selects an optimum device feature subset from the computing resources and storages by our cloud-based building management system. The performance of our proposed system is tested via experiments which verify that its measures are satisfactory.
