AB Cloud computing is an emerging information technology which is rapidly growing. However, measuring the performance of cloud based applications in real environments is a challenging task for research as well as business community. In this work, we focused on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) facility of cloud computing. We made a performance evaluation of two renowned public and private cloud platforms. Several performance metrics such as integer, floating Point, GFLOPS, read, random Read, write, random write, bandwidth, jitter and throughput were used to analyze the performance of cloud resources. The motive of this analysis is to help cloud providers to adjust their data center parameters under different working conditions as well as cloud customers to monitor their hired resources. We analyzed and compared the performance of OpenStack and Windows Azure platforms by considering resources like CPU, memory, disk and network in a real cloud setup. In order to evaluate each feature, we used related benchmarks, for example, Geekbench & LINPACK for CPU performance, RAMspeed & STREAM for memory performance, IOzone for disk performance and Iperf for network performance. Our experimental results showed that the performance of both clouds is almost same; however, OpenStack seems to be better option as compared to Windows Azur keeping in view its cost as well as network performance.
