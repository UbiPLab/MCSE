AB Cloud storage is a new storage mode emerged along with the development of cloud computing paradigm. By migrating the data to cloud storage, the consumers can be liberated from building and maintaining the private storage infrastructure, and they can enjoy the data storage service at anywhere and anytime with high reliability and a relatively low cost. However, the security and privacy risks, especially the confidentiality and integrity of data seem to be the biggest hurdle to the adoption of the cloud storage applications. In this paper, we consider the secure data access and sharing issues for cloud storage services. Based on the intractability of the discrete logarithm problem, we design a secure data access and data sharing scheme for cloud storage, where we utilize the user authentication scheme to deal with the data access problem. According to our analysis, through our scheme, only valid user with the correct password and biometric can access to the cloud storage provider. Besides, the authorized users can access the rightful resources and verify the validity of the shared data, but cannot transfer the permission to any other party. At the same time, the confidentiality and integrity of data can be guaranteed.
