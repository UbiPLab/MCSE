AB In order to meet the demand for network bandwidth and the reliability of the cloud computing applications, in recent years, many new data center network architectures have been put forward. They use the rich resources of network interconnection server to provide high performance and high fault-tolerant routing forwarding service. However, these "rich connection" architectures have network problems of energy consumption and energy use such as inefficient, resulted in the network of high operating costs and a large number of energy waste. In this paper, a typical energy efficiency of data center network architecture is studied from the perspective of network routing and scheduling. Different network flow scheduling and routing policy influence on energy consumption of data center network, in order to solve the above-mentioned problems, we put forward a kind of routing energy-saving mechanism network based on QoS which can improve the link utilization and the use of the network energy efficiency. The mechanism can effectively save the network energy consumption, and help us improve the average completion time of network flow.
