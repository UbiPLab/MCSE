DE Cloud Computing; Privacy Manager; Privacy laws; Privacy Infomediary and
   Regulations
AB Cloud computing is the most recent technology in which information can be created, stored, manipulated and accessed wherever needed. Now, as the number of users is increasing day by day, the privacy of the overall network may lose if the private information of a person or any organisation is stolen or hacked by any other person. For that, we have made a survey over the privacy of the information stored in the cloud network. We have also discussed about the information for which privacy management is required. Privacy laws are also discussed in this paper. To protect information from cyber-crime or any other potential threats we have proposed about the need of privacy manager in the cloud network. Thus privacy of the network can be managed as well as security and trustworthiness can also be maintained.
