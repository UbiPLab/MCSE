AB Development and progress mainly depends on education and its solid dissemination. Technologies as well as engineering solutions are important for the business and corporate houses. In this context, educational initiatives and programs play a vital role. Developing countries are suffering from many problems and therefore fostering new academic innovation and researches on economic development in today's context. Information Technologies and management science are important for solid business solutions. Therefore, education and knowledge dissemination play an important and valuable role. In many developing countries, gaps between industrial needs and the availability of skilled labor are limited. Information Sciences and Computing are the most valuable areas of study in today's knowledge world. The components, subsets, and subfields of Information Sciences and Technology are rapidly emerging worldwide. Among the emerging and popular areas, a few include Cloud Computing, Green Computing, Green Systems, Big-Data Science, Internet, Business Analytics, and Business Intelligence. Developing countries (like China, Colombia, Malaysia, Mauritius, India, Brazil, South Africa) depend in many ways on knowledge dissemination and solid manpower for their development. Thus, there is an urgent need to introduce such programs and the majority of these programs have been proposed here. Information Science and Technology (IST) with programs such as Bachelors, Masters, and Doctoral Degrees have been listed here with academic and industrial contexts. This article highlights these programs with proper SWOT analysis.
