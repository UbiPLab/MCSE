ID VIRTUAL MACHINE; LIVE MIGRATION
AB In the centralized cloud controlled environment, the decision-making and monitoring play crucial role where in the host controller (HC) manages the resources across hosts in data center (DC). HC does virtual machine (VM) and physical hosts management. The VM management includes VM creation, monitoring, and migration. If HC down, the services hosted by various hosts in DC can't be accessed outside the DC. Decentralized VM management avoids centralized failure by considering one of the hosts from DC as HC that helps in maintaining DC in running state. Each host in DC has many VM's with the threshold limit beyond which it can't provide service. To maintain threshold, the host's in DC does VM migration across various hosts. The data in migration is in the form of plaintext, the intruder can analyze packet movement and can control hosts traffic. The incorporation of security mechanism on hosts in DC helps protecting data in migration. This paper discusses an approach for dynamic HC selection, VM selection and secure VM migration over cloud environment.
