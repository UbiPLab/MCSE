AB Galaxies represent one of the preferred candidate sources to drive the reionization of the universe. Even as gains are made in mapping the galaxy UV luminosity density to z > 6, significant uncertainties remain regarding the conversion to the implied ionizing emissivity. The relevant unknowns are the Lyman-continuum (LyC) photon production efficiency xi(ion) and the escape fraction f(esc). As we show here, the first of these unknowns is directly measurable in z = 4-5 galaxies based on the impact the Ha line has on the observed IRAC fluxes. By computing a LyC photon production rate from the implied Ha luminosities for a broad selection of z = 4-5 galaxies and comparing this against the dust-corrected UV-continuum luminosities, we provide the first-ever direct estimates of the LyC photon production efficiency xion for the z >= 4 galaxy population. We find log(10) xi(ion)/[Hz erg(-1)] to have a mean value of 25.27(-0.03)(+0.03) and 25.34(-0.02)(+0.02) for sub-L* z = 4-5 galaxies adopting Calzetti and SMC dust laws, respectively. Reassuringly, both derived values are consistent with the standard assumed xi(ion)'s in reionization models, with a slight preference for higher xi(ion)'s (by similar to 0.1 dex) adopting the SMC dust law. High values of xi(ion) (similar to 25.5-25.8 dex) are derived for the bluest galaxies (beta < -2.3) in our samples, independent of dust law and consistent with results for a z = 7.045 galaxy. Such elevated values of xion would have important consequences, indicating that f(esc) cannot be in excess of 13% for standard assumptions about the faint-end cut-off to the LF and the clumping factor.
