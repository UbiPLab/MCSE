AB FPGAs have a huge potential to be used as a type of adaptive hardware in IoT applications, that require self-integration and self-adaptation. While widely accepted and used in cloud and edge applications, they are not commonly used in embedded devices. This is due to the highly complex development process to be able to include adaptive hardware and make it available to all layers of an IoT system. For this reason, we present in this work the Elastic IoT platform, a framework to facilitate development and deployment of distributed IoT applications, that take advantage of adaptive embedded devices. It uses a resource-oriented approach to abstract available data and processing capabilities to make them available as-a-Service. We present an application example to illustrate the convenience of using the system services provided by the Elastic IoT platform, simplifying the development of a truly self-integrating and self-adaptive IoT system.
