AB Cloud computing is one of emerging computing models that has many advantages. The IT industry is keenly aware of the need for Green Cloud computing solutions that save energy for the environment as well as reduce operational costs. This article presents a new green Cloud Computing framework based on multi agent systems for optimizing resource allocation in data centers (DCs). Our framework based on a new cloud computing architecture that benefits from the combination of the Cloud and agent technologies. DCs hosting Cloud applications need energy-aware resource allocation mechanisms that minimize energy costs and other operational costs. This article offers a logical solution to manage physical and virtual resources in smarter data center.
