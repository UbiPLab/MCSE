AB Having rapid and reliable knowledge of the quality of dairy farm forage is crucial for technicians and producers. However, the necessary equipment to fulfil these requirements is oftentimes expensive and complex to use. This work presents a portable instrument system to analyze the nutritional values of dairy farm forage using near-infrared spectrometry (NIRS) techniques. Using the Internet of Things (IoT) tools, data are sent to the cloud for processing; following this, they are accessible to any device. To analyze the nutritional values of dairy farm forage a chemometric model and implemented the instrument to understand the relationship between the measured spectrum and the concentration of the substances of interest was developed. The quality of the proposed methodology was validated by comparing reference and NIR data by using the statistic Standard Error of Calibration.
