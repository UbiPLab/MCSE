AB This paper explores the emergence and adoption of cloud computing by enterprises in sub-Saharan Africa. Several studies have shown the benefits of cloud technologies for enterprises. Using qualitative techniques we obtained and analyzed data from nine enterprises regarding the adoption of cloud computing as an IT strategy. These enterprises span the finance, information and communication technology (ICT) training, research, construction and manufacturing sectors in Ethiopia. We found that, contrary to the literature on cloud computing adoption in the global north, these enterprises are yet to adopt cloud computing as an IT provisioning method and they lack awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of adopting the cloud. The enterprises are concerned with challenges like security, privacy and trust issues as well as government telecommunications infrastructure policies and cloud technology skills acquisition. This research is part of a wider study that has taken place in Nigeria and Ghana, where we have observed higher levels of adoption. This research raises awareness of the challenges and potential benefits of cloud adoption.
