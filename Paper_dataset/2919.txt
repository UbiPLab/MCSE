DE Color transfer; Encrypted domain processing; Cloud computing
AB Cloud infrastructures are developed and maintained by third parties and users are always concerned about processing and storing their data over the cloud. Recent technologies such as high definition and 360-degree images/videos require efficient color processing, and current trend towards the cloud computing has initiated a necessity of performing color transfer remotely by untrusted third party servers. Nowadays, this field is emerging fast due to its inherent potential and research work in this direction is highly demanded. To address this necessity, we present a system that addresses the challenge of performing privacy preserving color transfer over third party servers. We use a one-dimensional chaotic logistic map coupled with ramp secret sharing scheme in a manner that secret images can be stored and processed for color transfer in the encrypted domain. Experimental results and security analysis demonstrate effectiveness of the approach against existing techniques of color transfer as well as image encryption.
