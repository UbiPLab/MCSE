AB The article submits the results of 3D computational modeling of the adiabatic interaction between a shock wave and molecular clouds. According to the problem set, two spherical clouds with preestablished density fields interact with the post-shock medium of supernova blast remnants. Gas flow evolution of molecular clouds is derived by solving the time dependent equations of mass, momentum, and energy conservation. High resolution numerical grids (more than two billion nodes) were used in parallel calculations on multiprocessor hybrid computers. The collision was found to give rise to the supersonic turbulence in a cloud mixing zone, the formation of filamentous structures, the significant stratification of gas density, the disruption of clouds, and the transformation of emerging structures. The peculiarities of cloud-clump-shell fragmentation of filamentous structures are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
