AB Proximate cloud computing enables computationally intensive applications on mobile devices, providing a rich user experience. However, remote resource bottlenecks limit the scalability of offloading, requiring optimization of the offloading decision and resource utilization. To this end, in this paper, we leverage the variability in capabilities of mobile devices and user preferences. Our system utility metric is a measure of quality of experience (QoE) based on task completion time and energy consumption of a mobile device. We propose a heuristic offloading decision algorithm (HODA), which is semidistributed and jointly optimizes the offloading decision, and communication and computation resources to maximize system utility. Our main contribution is to reduce the problem to a submodular maximization problem and prove its NP-hardness by decomposing it into two subproblems: 1) optimization of communication and computation resources solved by quasiconvex and convex optimization and 2) offloading decision solved by submodular set function optimization. HODA reduces the complexity of finding the local optimum to O(K-3), where K is the number of mobile users. Simulation results show that HODA performs within 5% of the optimal on average. Compared with other solutions, HODA's performance is significantly superior as the number of users increases.
