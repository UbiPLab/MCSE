AB On large-scale data analysis platforms deployed on cloud infrastructures over the Internet, the instability of the data transfer time and the dynamics of the processing rate require a more sophisticated data distribution scheme which maximizes parallel efficiency by achieving the balanced load among participated computing elements and by eliminating the idle time of each computing element. In particular, under the constraints that have the real-time and limited data buffer (in-memory storage) are given, it needs more controllable mechanism to prevent both the overflow and the underflow of the finite buffer. In this paper, we propose an auto regulated data provisioning model based on receiver-driven data pull model. On this model, we provide a synchronized data replenishment mechanism that implicitly avoids the data buffer overflow as well as explicitly regulates the data buffer underflow by adequately adjusting the buffer resilience. To estimate the optimal size of buffer resilience, we exploits an adaptive buffer resilience control scheme that minimizes both data buffer space and idle time of the processing elements based on directly measured sample path analysis. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme provides allowable approximation compared to the numerical results. Also, it is suitably efficient to apply for such a dynamic environment that cannot postulate the stochastic characteristic for the data transfer time, the data processing rate, or even an environment where the fluctuation of the both is presented.
