AB Sensor Clouds have opened new possibilities for researchers of disciplines such as environmental monitoring, precision agriculture and flood prevention. This technology uses Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to collect real world data and Cloud Computing to store and process them. The remote management of WSNs setup and data in Sensor Clouds implies: real time access to collected data, sensor setup reconfiguration and sensor battery status monitoring. Currently there are different platforms for WSNs data and setup management in Sensor Clouds. Generally, these platforms require that scientists of the mentioned disciplines must have knowledge of WSNs and web services programming in order to reconfigure the sensors setup. Hence, these sensing resources can not be provided in a transparent way to end-users. In this paper, we propose the use of standard Cloud File Synchronization Services (CFSS) for carrying out the full management of WSNs in Sensor Clouds. In order to validate our proposal, we conduct experiments using a Sensor Cloud platform based on CFSS called Sensor Cirrus.
