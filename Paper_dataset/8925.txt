AB In this paper, a novel intelligent healthcare system and the sensor network deployment strategy based on the multimodal fused information are analysed. The system could be analysed from two levels, the systematic level and the specific level. From the systematic perspective, the focus is the health monitoring system based on the cloud computing platform. The specific level is the embedded technology in application of the medical equipment. This study will be the medical care combined with the general cloud technology, mobile technology, built a cloud platform sharing of medical information system, for medical institutions and patients and family members and the other related personnel to provide the fast and efficient service which can be reflected from the three aspects. (1) Medical end. The doctor can view the patient's medical records from medical terminal clouds or some other physiological information. (2) The pulse signal detection and processing. (3) Cloud platform management system. Cloud management platform is mainly through the remote medical management system to conduct the core comprehensive business management. The experiment result proves the feasibility of the system.
