AB A preliminary analysis of the Individual Student Process (ISP) allowed the detection of difficulties and delays in its access by schools, students, parents, teachers and institutions. Knowing that student success in school substantially depends on the interpersonal supervising of the family, school, and community, access problems make it difficult to be aware of student progress in a timely manner. These limitations were the primary motivator for the initial research and the project presented here - Automation of Individual Student Process accessible through cloud computing - proved to be highly efficient with respect to the quality of the communication between stakeholders, and in diminishing bureaucracy in educational transitions inside and out Portugal.
