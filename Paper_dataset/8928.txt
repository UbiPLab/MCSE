AB The main idea of the paper is to analyse the organisational resilience potential of enterprises that may be modelled as a non-cloud enterprise or modelled from the perspective of being a cloud-based enterprise in a supply chain. In this manner, the model of an organisation is presented as a network of business processes. Organisational resilience factors (RFs) are assessed on the level of each business process and the overall level of organisational resilience potential is obtained for each organisation. The level of organisational resilience potential in these organisations is assessed when the enterprise is modelled, in the first place, as a non-cloud enterprise and also modelled from the perspective of being a cloud-based enterprise in a supply chain. In this way, the level of organisational resilience potential may be compared and analysed, which is a significant benchmark starting point for this research and practice domain.
