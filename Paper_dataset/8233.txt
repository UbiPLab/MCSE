AB In this paper, the ATSC 3.0 broadcast Radio Access Technology (RAT) is aligned with 3GPP 5G NR RAT in the context of 5G convergence starting in Release 16. The 5G system architecture release 16 includes a new 5G physical layer known as 5G NR "New Radio" and a "Cloud Native" 5G Core (5GC) using cloud computing. The 5GC is agnostic to the type of radio access technology used and is enabler of many types of convergence. A novel shared multi-tenant broadcast core network architecture designed to interwork with 5GC is discussed. With the 3GPP 5G NR unicast and Non-3GPP ATSC 3.0 broadcast synergistically aligned using methods of Release 16. This includes using 3GPP Access Traffic Steering, Switching, Splitting (ATSSS) and a multi-radio dual simultaneous connected User Equipment (UE). This aligns ATSC 3.0, the first forward looking (non-backward-compatible) native IP OFDM broadcast standard, with 3GPP LTE/5G unicast as a converged 5G vertical. The proposed method and architecture are orthogonal to LTE broadcast Release 16 and is synergistic to 5G NR mixed-mode multicast unicast in future.
