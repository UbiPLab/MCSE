AB In recent years, a large and growing body of literature has addressed the energy-efficient resource management problem in data centers. Due to the fact that cooling costs still remain the major portion of the total data center energy cost, thermal-aware resource management techniques have been employed to make additional energy savings. In this paper, we formulate the problem of minimizing the total energy consumption of a heterogeneous data center (MITEC) as a non-linear integer optimization problem. We consider both computing and cooling energy consumption and provide a thermal-aware Virtual Machine (VM) allocation heuristic based on the genetic algorithm. Experimental results show that, using the proposed formulation, up to 30% energy saving is achieved compared to thermal-aware greedy algorithms and power-aware VM allocation heuristics.
