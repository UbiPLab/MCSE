AB Aiming at the shortcomings of the current migration algorithm based on the importance of data, like poor load balancing and large consumption of resources, the paper proposes a dynamic migration algorithm for marine big data in cloud computing environment. Firstly, the characteristics of marine big data are analyzed. And then the Moran's 1 index is used to analyze the correlation index, and the storage of marine big data in cloud computing environment is positioned. Finally, adaptive inertia weight is introduced based on the firefly algorithm, through the objective function of the bandwidth to calculate the minimum value of the bandwidth and use as the optimal solution, and the dynamic migration of marine big data is realized. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm not only has better migration performance, but also takes into account migration costs and load balancing, resource utilization and bandwidth utilization.
