AB Cloud computing is a promising research domain used to enhance the performance of information systems and applications used at our daily life. Workflow scheduling in cloud platform is a complex optimization problem because of its heterogeneous nature, complex billing models and infinite resources requirements which has lead the users to look for an optimal or a suboptimal solution that satisfy multiple competing goals such as minimum makespan and energy efficient solutions. The focus of this paper is to schedule workflow applications, optimizing makespan and energy consumption. A high-performance method for scheduling workflow on cloud computing platform will be presented in this paper, called non-dominated sorting particle swarm optimization (NSPSO). The proposed method is evaluated on synthetic representation of real world scientific workflow applications. The simulation results shows that the proposed method can provide better workflow scheduling solution for cloud when compared with other state-of-the-art methods.
