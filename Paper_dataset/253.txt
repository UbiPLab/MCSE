AB This paper applies the entropy-based fractal indexing scheme that enables the grid environment for fast indexing and querying. It addresses the issue of fault tolerance and load balancing-based fractal management to make computational grids more effective and reliable. A fractal dimension of a cloud of points gives an estimate of the intrinsic dimensionality of the data in that space. The main drawback of this technique is the long computing time. The main contribution of the suggested work is to investigate the effect of fractal transform by adding R-tree index structure-based entropy to existing grid computing models to obtain a balanced infrastructure with minimal fault. In this regard, the presented work is going to extend the commonly scheduling algorithms that are built based on the physical grid structure to a reduced logical network. The objective of this logical network is to reduce the searching in the grid paths according to arrival time rate and path's bandwidth with respect to load balance and fault tolerance, respectively. Furthermore, an optimization searching technique is utilized to enhance the grid performance by investigating the optimum number of nodes extracted from the logical grid. The experimental results indicated that the proposed model has better execution time, throughput, makespan, latency, load balancing, and success rate.
