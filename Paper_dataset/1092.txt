AB A management and orchestration framework (MANO) in network function virtualization (NFV) enables the agile deployment and operation of virtual network functions over a geographically distributed cloud infrastructure. This facilitates the deployment of redundancy models (i.e., high availability clusters) over different cloud centers, to guarantee the high availability of network services. In particular, in the telecommunications field, availability and resiliency are always required at a high level. Existing placement algorithms only consider one type of redundancy model at a given time. However, in reality, different redundancy configurations can be utilized to ensure the availability of virtual functions. In this article, we present an optimization model and topology-aware resource-efficient placement algorithm (TARE), which can be employed to optimally deploy high availability clusters with different redundancy configurations over geo-distributed cloud infrastructures. This model takes into account the different requirements of various high availability clusters in terms of bandwidth and computing resource demands. By simulation, the TARE has better performance than other baseline solutions in terms of the bandwidth usage, while maintaining an acceptable level of availability.
