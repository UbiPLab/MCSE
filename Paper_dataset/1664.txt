AB Since the inception of the internetwork facility, it has been continuously serving as the fundamental backbone of existing aspects, such as cloud, fog, and edge computing. Several application perspectives are in practice that mandate the involvement of application domains including smart retail, transportation, and data analytics. However, the deployed service platforms do not conform to facilitate the minimal and/or internetwork-free orientation to current paradigms. Hence, to cater this approach, a dew computing paradigm that goals at bringing cloud, fog, or edge resources and services to the nearest of user's periphery without or minimal use of internetwork has been introduced. This article advocates the feasibility, applicability, and appropriation of dew computing while leveraging several real-life case studies with special attention to internetwork-free movement. From earlier published literary works, a taxonomy has been devised in the dominion of dew computing. Moreover, highlights are made on selective requirements that would be key to the advancement of dew computing. Finally, challenges are discussed to provide future research directions in the dew computing domain.
