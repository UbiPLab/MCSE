AB Internet of Thing (IoT) has been attracting the interest of researchers in recent years. Traditionally, only handful types of devices had the capability to be connected to internet/ intranet, but due to the latest developments in RFID, NFC, smart sensors and communication protocols billions of heterogeneous devices are being connected each year. From smart phones uploading the data regarding location and fitness to smart grids uploading the data regarding energy consumption and distribution, these devices are generating a huge amount of data each passing moment. This research paper proposes a data management framework to securely manage the huge amount of data that is being generated by IoT enabled devices. The proposed framework is divided into nine layers. The framework incorporates layers such as data collection layer, fog computing layer, integrity management layer, security layer, data aggregation layer, data analysis layer, data storage layer, application layer and archiving layer. The security layer has been proposed as a background layer because all layers shall ensure the privacy and security of the data. These layers will help in managing the data from the point where it is generated by an IoT enabled device until the point where the data is archived at the data center.
