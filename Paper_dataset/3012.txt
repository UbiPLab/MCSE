AB With mission critical web applications and resources being hosted on cloud environments, and cloud services growing fast, the need for having greater level of service assurance regarding fault tolerance for availability and reliability has increased. The high priority now is ensuring a fault tolerant environment that can keep the systems up and running. To minimize the impact of downtime or accessibility failure due to systems, network devices or hardware, the expectations are that such failures need to be anticipated and handled proactively in fast, intelligent way. This article discusses the fault tolerance system for cloud computing environments, analyzes whether this is effective for Cloud environments.
