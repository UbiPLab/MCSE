AB Mathematical calculation over ciphertext during homomorphic encryption makes result of the calculation in a form of ciphertext. Obtained result can be decrypted with an appropriate key for further usage. In the era of cloud computing, this feature can be used to solve problems of storing and processing sensitive data in the cloud. Also, use of homomorphic encryption keeps both, data and results of processing, highly secured at the same time. Considering the overwhelming presence of computers with limited resources, the presence of the Internet and the ultimate practical need for use of cloud and its resources, in this paper we explored and presented the characteristics of a practical use of partial homomorphic encryption and its processing of ciphertext in the cloud on computer system with limited resources.
