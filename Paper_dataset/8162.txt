AB Due to the popularity of vehicle applications and the increase of the number of vehicles, the physical resources of roadside infrastructure are limited. When a large number of vehicles are connected to the vehicle networks, the energy consumption and latency are simultaneously increased. The framework for integrating the Content Delivery Network (CDN) and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) can reduce the latency and energy consumption. In vehicle network, vehicle mobility poses a major challenge to the continuity of cloud services. Therefore, Mobility Management (MM) is proposed to deal with this problem. The Dynamic Channel Allocation algorithm with Overhead selection (ODCA) is used to avoid the ping-pong effect and reduces the handover time of vehicles between cells. The cooperative game algorithm based on RoadSide Unit (RSU) is used for virtual machine migration and a learning-based price control mechanism is developed to process vehicular computation resources efficiently. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can improve resource utilization and reduce overhead compared with the existing algorithms.
