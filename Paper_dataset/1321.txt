AB Cloud computing is a state of the art technology that provides services to individuals and organizations on demand via the Internet. Implementation of cloud services in an organization will lead to improved performance and reduced cost related to computing services. A number of previous studies suggest that there is a need to further investigate the role of gender on the adoption of cloud computing, especially in developing countries. The aim of this paper is to investigate the role of gender in the adoption of cloud computing services by university students in KSA. To meet the research objective a SEM study was conducted using responses from 451 Saudi higher education students to determine the role of gender on could computing acceptance in KSA context. The findings of this research show that there is a settle difference between female and male students where trust was found to be a significant determinant of behavioural intention for female students but not for their male counterparts. On the other hand, image was found to be a significant determinant of PU for male students but not for female students.
