AB Various Internet solutions take their power processing and analysis from cloud computing services. Internet of Things (IoT) applications started discovering the benefits of computing, processing, and analysis on the device itself aiming to reduce latency for time-critical applications. However, on-device processing is not suitable for resource-constraints IoT devices. Edge computing (EC) came as an alternative solution that tends to move services and computation more closer to consumers, at the edge. In this letter, we study and discuss the applicability of merging deep learning (DL) models, i.e., convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), and reinforcement learning (RL), with IoT and information-centric networking which is a promising future Internet architecture, combined all together with the EC concept. Therefore, a CNN model can be used in the IoT area to exploit reliably data from a complex environment. Moreover, RL and RNN have been recently integrated into IoT, which can be used to take the multi-modality of data in real-time applications into account.
