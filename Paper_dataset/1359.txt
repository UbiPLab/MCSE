AB The emergence of Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things (IoT) has meant that the manufacturing industry has evolved from embedded systems to cyber-physical systems (CPSs). This transformation has provided manufacturers with the ability to measure the performance of industrial equipment by means of data gathered from on-board sensors. This allows the status of industrial systems to be monitored and can detect anomalies. However, the increased amount of measured data has prompted many companies to investigate innovative ways to manage these volumes of data. In recent years, cloud computing and big data technologies have emerged among the scientific communities as key enabling technologies to address the current needs of CPSs. This paper presents a large-scale platform for CPS real-time monitoring based on big data technologies, which aims to perform real-time analysis that targets the monitoring of industrial machines in a real work environment. This paper is validated by implementing the proposed solution on a real industrial use case that includes several industrial press machines. The formal experiments in a real scenario are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of this solution and also its adequacy and scalability for future demand requirements. As a result of the implantation of this solution, the overall equipment effectiveness has been improved.
