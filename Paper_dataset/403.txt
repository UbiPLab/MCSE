AB Industry 4.0 is the new industrial stage that's committed to greater automation, connectivity and globalization. The interrelation between different areas has penetrated the industrial world thanks to the Internet of things and the world of Big Data. This amount of information is available in plants and is growing increasingly, also aided by the network computing services offered by cloud computing or edge computing. That is why it's necessary to carry out complex fusion methods and data analysis using Machine Learning techniques to address specific industrial requirements and needs. The central challenge of industry 4.0 from the perspective of data science is to predict the history within monitored processes, providing as much information as possible, avoiding them and stave off severe economic losses. This article will show a review of the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques such as Machine Learning (ML) immersed in multi-agent systems (MAS) in Industry 4.0. For this, a bibliographic search has been carried out in databases recognized as Science Direct, Google Scholar, Scopus or Springer, filtering the investigations from 2018 to actuality. The article concludes pointing out possible future lines and the importance of transition towards the implementation of new technologies for the competitiveness of factories.
