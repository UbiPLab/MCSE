AB Due to the demands of new technologies such as social networks, e-commerce and cloud computing, more energy is being consumed in order to store all the produced data. While these new technologies require high levels of availability, a reduction in the cost and environmental impact is also expected. The present paper proposes a power balancing algorithm (power load distribution algorithm-depth (PLDA-D)) to optimize the energy distribution of data center electrical infrastructures. The PLDA-D is based on the Bellman and Ford-Fulkerson flow algorithms that analyze energy-flow models (EFM). EFM computes the power efficiency, sustainability and cost metrics of data center infrastructures. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed strategy, we present a case study that analyzes four power infrastructures. The results obtained show about a 3.8% reduction in sustainability impact and operational costs.
