AB The impact of glaciogenic seeding on precipitation remains uncertain, mainly because of the noisy nature of precipitation. Operational seeding programs often target cold-season orographic clouds because of their abundance of supercooled liquid water. Such clouds are complicated because of common natural seeding from above (seeder-feeder effect) or from below (blowing snow). Here, observations, mainly from a profiling airborne Doppler radar, and numerical simulations are used to examine the impact of glaciogenic seeding on a very shallow (<1 km), largely blocked cloud that is not naturally seeded from aloft or from below. This cloud has limited but persistent supercooled liquid water, a cloud-base (top) temperature of -12 degrees C (-16 degrees C), and produces only very light snowfall naturally. A Weather Research and Forecasting Model large-eddy simulation at 100-m resolution captures the observed upstream stability and wind profiles and reproduces the essential characteristics of the orographic flow, cloud, and precipitation. Both observations and simulations indicate that seeding locally increases radar (or computed) reflectivity in the target area, even after removal of the natural trend between these two periods in a nearby control region. A model sensitivity run suggests that seeding effectively glaciates the mostly liquid cloud and substantially increases snowfall within the seeding plume. This is due to a dramatic increase in the number of ice particles and not to their size. The increased ice particle concentration facilitates snow growth by vapor deposition in a cloud the temperature range of which is conducive to the Bergeron process.
