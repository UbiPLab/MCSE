AB We propose an approach for the automatic coarse alignment of 3D point clouds which have been acquired from various platforms. The method is based on 2D keypoint matching performed on height map images of the point clouds. Initially, a multi-scale wavelet keypoint detector is applied, followed by adaptive non-maxima suppression. A scale, rotation and translation-invariant descriptor is then computed for all keypoints. The descriptor is built using the log-polar mapping of Gabor filter derivatives in combination with the so-called Rapid Transform. In the final step, source and target height map keypoint correspondences are determined using a bi-directional nearest neighbour similarity check, together with a threshold-free modified-RANSAC. Experiments with urban and non-urban scenes are presented and results show scale errors ranging from 0.01 to 0.03, 3D rotation errors in the order of 0.2 to 0.3 and 3D translation errors from 0.09 m to 1.1 m.
