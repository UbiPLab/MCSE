AB Featured Application The UTOPIA Smart Video Surveillance System can be used for object recognition, tracking, and behavior analysis as well as object detection, and can also use Storm and Spark as well asMapReduce. A smart city is a future city that enables citizens to enjoy Information and Communication Technology (ICT) based smart services with any device, anytime, anywhere. It heavily utilizes Internet of Things. It includes many video cameras to provide various kinds of services for smart cities. Video cameras continuously feed big video data to the smart city system, and smart cities need to process the big video data as fast as it can. This is a very challenging task because big computational power is required to shorten processing time. This paper introduces UTOPIA Smart Video Surveillance, which analyzes the big video images using MapReduce, for smart cities. We implemented the smart video surveillance in our middleware platform. This paper explains its mechanism, implementation, and operation and presents performance evaluation results to confirm that the system worked well and is scalable, efficient, reliable, and flexible.
